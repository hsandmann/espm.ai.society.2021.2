FRIDAY THE 13TH PART VIII: JASON TAKES MANHATTAN

	Written by Rob Hedden


	FADE IN:

	EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	A dark, rumbling sky. Haze clings to the lake as we float 
	across it, clearing to bring the opposite shoreline into 
	view. A few scattered streetlights. Dilapidated cabins. 
	An abandoned campsite. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE. 

	We continue to drift towards it, hearing the faint sound 
	of seductive music and an occasional giggle. A small 
	HOUSEBOAT floats into our foreground, its interior light 
	flickering as TWO BODIES move around inside.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

	A teenage boy and girl, JIM and SUZY, are slow-dancing. 
	Jim's lips softly touch her lissome shoulders.

				JIM
		Well...how do you feel?

				SUZY
		Ask me in about five minutes.

	She bites his ear, giggles, then kisses him fully..

				JIM
		I'm talking about graduation. Being 
		totally free to do whatever we want 
		now.

	Her hands slip inside his Pendleton shirt. He sighs.

				SUZY
		It feels excellent.

	Her mouth finds his again. After a long kiss, he gently 
	pulls away from her with a teasing smile.

				JIM
		Gotta throw the anchor over.

	He leaves the cabin. She slips under the bed sheets.

	EXT. HOUSEBOAT DECK - NIGHT

	as Jim tosses a small anchor overboard.

	TIGHT ON WATER SURFACE

	as the weighty object splashes, sinking into black 
	oblivion, pulling its cable down with it. 

	JIM 

	glances at the lake, at their eerie surroundings. He 
	feels a chill, heading back inside.

	EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

	as the anchor drifts to the lake bottom, dropping a few 
	feet from a THICK POWER CABLE which rests in the lake 
	silt.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

	as Jim returns with an uneasy expression. He crawls on 
	top of the bed, kissing her again, but not with the same 
	enthusiasm as before.

				SUZY
		What's wrong?

				JIM
		Nothing.

	He starts to pull off his shirt and join her. She senses 
	his anxiety.

				SUZY
		C'mon, Jimmy. Something's bothering 
		you.

	Jim pauses, turning off the mood music.

				JIM
		It's just that we're right around that 
		old summer camp where all those 
		murders took place.

	The boat creaks. She's instantly nervous.

				SUZY
		What murders?

				JIM
		Never mind, you don't want to know 
		about it.

				SUZY
		Tell me.

				JIM
		There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. 
		The guy's dead now, somewhere at the 
		bottom of this lake...if you believe 
		the stories.
			(beat)
		Let's drop it, okay?

	He starts to kiss her again. She stops him.

				SUZY
		What stories?

	He doesn't want to go into it but Suzy's face insists.

				JIM
		There was this boy named Jason 
		Voorhees who drowned in Crystal 
		Lake...

	FLASHBACK

	Eight year old JASON is desperately trying to tread 
	water, flailing his arms like a marionette to get 
	attention as he gulps down gallons of mossy lake water.

				YOUNG JASON
		Hhhhelp....me....I'm drowning...

				JIM (V.O.)
		None of the counselors heard him.

				YOUNG JASON
		Mmmmmmommy....

	...And Jason finally slips under the surface for good.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

				JIM
		A bunch of years went by and everybody 
		forgot about it.
			(beat)
		That's when the murders started.

	FLASHBACK MONTAGE (STOCK)

	as our senses are bombarded with QUICK CUTS of assorted

	teenagers just about to die, their screams echoing over 
	each other. We do not see the attacker. As the 
	cacophony reaches a screeching crescendo, CUT BACK TO:

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

	as the silence hits us hard again.

				SUZY
		Jason did it...?

				JIM'
		That's what some people thought. But 
		they were wrong.

	FLASHBACK (STOCK)

	as MRS. VOORHEES comes directly at camera wielding a huge 
	knife and a primal scream.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

				JIM
		His mother blamed the counselors for 
		his death and tried to kill them all.
			(dramatic pause)
		She got her head chopped off by one of 
		them.

	We don't need to see this clip...Suzy's reaction is quite 
	sufficient.

				SUZY
		So the murders stopped?

	He gives her a long, penetrating look.

				JIM
		No.

	FLASHBACK MONTAGE (STOCK)

	We're bombarded with QUICK FLASHES of a hockey masked 
	JASON wreaking havoc on assorted teenagers...brandishing 
	everything from hatchets to knives to chainsaws. Just as 
	Jason is about to stab us, CUT BACK TO:

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

	Suzy flinches as if she were getting the knife.

				

				JIM
		Legend has it that Jason came back to 
		avenge his mother's death, vowing to 
		kill every teenager from the area. 
			(beat)
		And every now and then, the murders 
		start up again. 

	The boat lurches slightly, tugging at the anchor cable. 
	She's scared: he's frightened himself a little, too.

				JIM
		Forget about it, Suzy. They're just 
		stories.

	He brushes her hair back, kissing her cheek gently, 
	finding the nape of her neck again. She closes her eyes, 
	trying to dismiss what he's dredged up. But she can't. 
	Suzy begins to rationalize.

				SUZY
		We're the last graduating class, 
		right? 

	Jim's kissing her body, putting Jason behind him.

				JIM
		Right.

				SUZY
		I mean, Lakeview High just closed its 
		doors for good, right?

				JIM
		Right.

				SUZY
		So there's no reason for him to come 
		back because there won't be any of us 
		around...right?

	Jim stops, looking her squarely in the eyes.

				JIM
		Right. Except that Jason isn't real 
		so none of it matters anyway.

	She starts to relax, returning his kisses.

	EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

	as the anchor drifts along the lake floor, tugging hard 
	on the power cable. Camera TRACKS along the cable, 
	coming to a RUSTY SET OF CHAINS TANGLED AROUND IT.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

	as Jim slides on top of Suzy. Thoughts of Jason are 
	starting to slip away along with their clothes.

	EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

	as the chains emit a dull tinkle due to movement from the 
	tugging anchor. Camera continues to TRACK again...and we 
	find to our horror that the waterlogged, fish-eaten body 
	of JASON IS SECURED BY THESE SAME CHAINS. (NOTE: Jason's 
	face is obscured.)

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

	Teenagers in love, lost in not-so-innocent passion. At 
	the same moment:

	EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

	The anchor tugs one last time and RIPS THROUGH THE CABLE. 
	SPARKS INSTANTLY FLY, chasing along the cable, finding 
	the chain which secures Jason and ENGULFING HIM IN 
	ELECTRICITY.

	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - ON LAKE SURFACE (EFX)

	as BRIGHT FLASHES OF BLUE LIGHT strobe-under the surface. 
	ARCING CURRENT chases up the anchor cable, sparking 
	across the hoist.

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - WIDE SHOT FROM WATER

	as the electricity feeding the streetlights is abruptly 
	extinguished, plunging the campsite into darkness.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

	as Suzy's eyes flash open.

				SUZY
		Did you hear that?

				JIM
		Hear what?

	He pulls her back down.

				SUZY
		C'mon, I'm serious.

	He knows the mood is broken.

				JIM
		All right, I'll check it out.

	He slips on his jeans, exiting the cabin. She pulls the 
	sheet up around her fearfully.

	EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)

	as the cable smolders, void of electricity now. TRACK to 
	find the chains again...but they're dangling loosely. 
	JASON IS GONE.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

	Suzy is tensely kneeling on the bed now. The black void 
	of night is all she sees out the cabin door, which Jim 
	has left open. An uncomfortable amount of time passes.

				SUZY
		Jimmy...?

	No answer. Her heart starts to pound.

				SUZY
		Jim...?

	Again, nothing. She wraps herself in the sheet, moving 
	towards the open door. The ship creaks again.

	SUZY'S POINT OF VIEW

	as she grows closer to the doorway, nothing but pitch-
	black beyond it.

				SUZY
		Stop screwing around, Jim. I mean 
		it...

	...And just as she reaches the door:

	A HOCKEY MASKED MONSTER

	leaps out, clutching a HUGE KNIFE. Suzy barely has time 
	to scream before JASON PLUNGES THE KNIFE INTO HER CHEST.

	SUZY

	stands there in speechless shock, looking down at her 
	mortal wound. But there's no blood.

	THE MONSTER

	pulls the knife back out, pushing the blade in and out 
	with his hand. It's a retractable rubber knife. JIM 
	pulls off the hockey mask with a huge grin, tossing it 
	aside.

				JIM
		Gotcha good, baby cakes.

	She doesn't know whether to hug him with relief or kick 
	him in the balls. He pulls her back onto the bed, 
	laughing.

	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK

	sitting dormant on the deck, where Jim tossed it. A 
	SHADOW FALLS ACROSS IT...followed by a SLIMY, DECOMPOSING 
	HAND. The hand grabs it like it's an old friend, pulling 
	it away.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

	as Jim holds his angry girlfriend down on the bed, trying 
	unsuccessfully to kiss her.

				JIM
		All right, all right -- I'm a major 
		ass.

				SUZY
		And you'll never do it again.

				JIM
		And I'll never do it again. Forgive 
		me?

				SUZY
		No.

	She's resisting only for effect. Her legs curl around 
	him, finally giving in.

	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

	A deadly-sharp SPEAR GUN rests in its rack outside the 
	cabin. JASON'S HAND REMOVES IT.

	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

	The sheets begin to roll like waves as they work each 
	other. Thoughts of Jason are nonexistent now.

	ANGLE - CABIN DOOR

	Nothing there for a moment...then a pair of moss-covered 
	BARE FEET SLOSH INTO FRAME.

	SUZY

	closes her eyes with pleasure...

	ANGLE - CABIN DOOR

	...and camera RISES from the mossy feet, up the bloodless 
	legs and torso to ultimately reveal the hockey-masked 
	face of our anti-hero: JASON VOORHEES.

	SUZY 

	lets out a broad smile, her eyelids fluttering. They stay 
	open long enough to regard the visitor in the doorway. 
	She tries to choke out a warning to Jim, who's just 
	collapsed himself.

				SUZY
		JJJJJJJJason...

	He doesn't follow her glance, smiling instead.

				JIM
		Uh-huh. You must really think I'm an 
		ass.

	But she continues to stare in horror as:

	JASON

	raises the spear, taking aim.

	ANGLE - SUZY AND JIM  

	Hs starts to kiss her but she bolts up with a blood-
	curdling SCREAM. A second later, JASON FIRES THE SPEAR, 
	PIERCING HER NECK, PINNING HER TO THE HEAD BOARD.

	Jim stares point-blank at his dead girlfriend, not able 
	to assimilate it quickly enough. He spins around to see 
	the monster himself.

				JIM
		Ohmygod...

	Jim springs off the bed, looking around for anything to 
	defend himself with, grabbing the bedside lamp. He 
	SMASHES IT OVER JASON'S HEAD which has little effect. Jim 
	scrambles to get past him, but Jason LIFTS JIM IN THE 
	AIR, SLAMMING HIM DOWN ON ONE OF THE SPIKED BEDPOSTS.

	EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	as the HOUSEBOAT silently drifts onward. The lone 
	silhouette of Jason emerges from within, taking the helm. 
	He's back.

							  FADE OUT/MAIN CREDITS.

	FADE IN:

	EXT. HARBOR - ESTABLISHING - DAY

	Only the faintest sign of daylight can be seen through a 
	thick blanket of gray fog. In the distance, speckled 
	lights outlining a smaller LUXURY CRUISE SHIP 
	intermittently appear.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY

	Standing at the boarding ramp is CHARLES MCCULLOCH, 
	clipboard in hand. He's just finished checking off a pair 
	of new-agey SENIOR GIRLS. McCulloch is approaching fifty, 
	wearing a tie and unwrinkled clothes, as well as the 
	disposition of a stern puritan.

				MCCULLOCH
		Remember girls, the shuffleboard 
		tournament will start at six p.m. 
		sharp. A non-attendance will restrict 
		your time in port, understood?

	They nod for his benefit, exchanging derogatory whispers 
	as they head up the ramp. Camera ADJUSTS to find a small 
	parking lot adjacent to the docks, where several cars are 
	just now arriving -- parents dropping off their high 
	school seniors, hugging them bon voyage.

	CLOSER ANGLE PARKING LOT

	as SEAN ROBERTSON walks toward the ship with pal MILES 
	WOLFE. Sean's a tall, nice looking, somewhat serious guy; 
	Miles is shorter, athletic and more extroverted.

				MILES
		You're telling me this boat has a pool 
		with a three meter board?

				SEAN
		It's a ship and that's right. Plus a 
		disco, gym, game room and a lot more.

				MILES
		I think I'm gonna blow off New York 
		and just stay on this thing.

				MCCULLOCH
		You'll do no such thing, Mr. Wolfe... 

	Camera ADJUSTS to reveal McCulloch, holding his list, 
	checking off their names.

				MCCULLOCH
		Your itinerary has been carefully 
		planned and make no mistake, it will 
		be executed accordingly.

				MILES
			(under his breath)
		Of course...wouldn't want to risk 
		enjoying this trip.

	McCulloch gives him a frown. Sean steps up to him 
	tentatively.

				SEAN
		Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. 
		McCulloch?

				MCCULLOCH
		Rennie's not coming.

	He's devastated.

				SEAN
		But I thought...

				MCCULLOCH
		She changed her mind.
			(eyeing list)
		Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom 
		one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are 
		in two-twenty-five.

	A booming VOICE from above interrupts them:

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON (O.S.)
		Sean -- where the hell have you been? 
		We're already into early departure 
		protocol...

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Standing on the upper deck is a no-nonsense, uniformed 
	Navy man, ADMIRAL ROBERTSON. The captain of the ship. And 
	Sean's father. Sean's sadness about Rennie's absence is 
	immediately replaced with anxiety.

				SEAN
		Be right up, Dad.

	He and Miles head up the gangway, both boys giving 
	McCulloch one last glare.

	INT. '76 BMW 2002 - DAY

	Behind the wheel is MISS COLLEEN VAN DEUSEN, thirties, 
	attractive, a progressive attitude. RENNIE WICKHAM sits 
	next to her -- she's seventeen, pretty, slightly 
	withdrawn. Rennie's dog TOBY, a border collie, rides in 
	the back seat.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		I'm glad you decided to come after 
		all.

				RENNIE
		Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles 
		will be.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		You let me worry about him, okay?
			(pause)
		Personal experiences are what fuel the 
		minds of great writers, Rennie. You 
		made the right decision.

				RENNIE
		What about not-so-great writers?

	Rennie smiles self-deprecatingly, Miss Van Deusen 
	grinning back. But Rennie's smiles are few and far 
	between, this one disappearing as she glances out the 
	window.

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (SECOND UNIT)

	as the countless gallons of harbor and lake water spread 
	out before her, eery in the bog. A small ROWBOAT grazes 
	across it occupied by two indistinguishable people.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	Rennie's eyes show a hidden terror. She quickly turns 
	away, shivering briefly. Miss Van Deusen notices. She 
	turns a corner, heading into the parking lot.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Everything okay?

				RENNIE
		Just felt a little chill.

	Rennie rubs her arms, faking coldness.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Did you know that I'm giving up 
		teaching?

				RENNIE
		Really?

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Since the school is closing anyway, 
		I'm going to write that novel I've 
		been threatening on everybody.

				RENNIE
		That's wonderful, Miss Van 
		Deusen...what's it about?

	She parks the car, turning off the ignition.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		A senior class cruise to Manhattan, 
		laced with romance, adventure and 
		murder.
			(beat)
		Or a Gothic cook book. I haven't 
		decided which.

	She's coaxed the smile out of Rennie again. Miss Van 
	Deusen pulls a small wrapped box from her glove 
	compartment, handing it to Rennie, who seems utterly 
	surprised.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Go on, open it.

	Rennie pops off the lid, revealing an antique ink-dip 
	pen.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Stephen King supposedly used it when 
		he was in high school.

				RENNIE
		I don't know what to say...

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Rennie, you're the best student I ever 
		had...you have a real gift. If anybody 
		can make use of that pen, it's you.

	Rennie hugs her teacher. Camera RISES above the car's 
	window, finding a Mercedes 560 SL pulling in a short 
	distance away.

	CLOSER ANGLE - MERCEDES

	A sexy, money-dressed blonde is behind the wheel. TAMARA 
	MASON. She climbs from her leather seats as a trio of 
	SENIOR GIRLS walk by, offering enthusiastic hi's and 
	hellos. She's obviously Miss Popular. Tamara crosses to a 
	cute Japanese girl unloading luggage from a beige Honda, 
	EVA WATANABE.

				. TAMARA
		Are you ready for drugs, sex and rock 
		'n roll or what, girl?

	Eva gives her a warning glance, nodding to her left. 
	Eva's MOTHER appears by the passenger door, forcing a 
	smile at Tamara.

				MRS. WATANABE
		Hello, Tamara.

				TAMARA
		Hi, Mrs. Watanabe. Just kidding.

				MRS. WATANABE
		Yes, I'm sure.

	Embarrassed, Eva hurries to her Mom, rushing a kiss 
	goodbye.

				EVA
		Don't worry about a thing, Mom. I'll 
		have a terrific time and I won't do 
		anything stupid, okay?

	Before Mrs. Watanabe can squeeze a word in, her daughter 
	is gone. She waves a bittersweet goodbye to her graduate.

				MRS. WATANABE
		I love you...

	TRACKING WITH TAMARA AND EVA

	Once they're out of Mrs. Watanabe's earshot --

				TAMARA
		I hear the crew members are cute guys 
		in their twenties.

				EVA
		Really?

				TAMARA
		I'm sure we'll have no problem getting 
		them to party with us...especially 
		with this.

	Tamara unzips her purse, revealing a baggie filled with 
	fine white powder. Eva looks very nervous.

				TAMARA
		It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It 
		cost over a thousand bucks but it's 
		the best.

				EVA
		He bought you that?

				TAMARA
		More or less. It's part of my college 
		fund.

				

	She grins coquettishly, walking on. Camera HOLDS on the 
	calm, foggy harbor...where the faint image of a HOUSEBOAT 
	is aimlessly drifting into port.

	CLOSER ANGLE - HOUSEBOAT

	Sure enough, it's the same one we saw JASON on last 
	night...but no one is behind the helm. It seems to be a 
	ghost ship.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY

	as Tamara tries to slip past McCulloch, busy with another 
	pair of seniors.

				MCCULLOCH
		You can stop right there, Miss Mason.

	He motions the others onward. Busted. Tamara instantly 
	hands Eva her drug-filled purse, paralyzing Eva.

				MCCULL40CH
		Only graduating seniors are allowed on 
		this cruise.

				TAMARA
		What are you talking about?

				MCCULLOCB
		You never turned in your final biology 
		project, so I've had your diploma 
		rescinded.

				TAMARA
		You can't do that...

				MCCULLOCH
		It's already been done.
			(turning to Eva)
		Congratulations on the 3.9 average, 
		Miss Watanabe. You're in stateroom two-
		fifty-five.

	Eva smiles awkwardly, reaching for her luggage, stalling 
	to see what happens with Tamara.

				TAMARA
		Look, Mr. McCulloch, I got in a car 
		accident yesterday and missed our 
		appointment. It's okay, no big deal, 
		just a bruised arm...
			(squeezes her arm)
		...so I brought my project along 
		today. It's in my suitcase. Really.

	He looks at her suitcase, not buying a word of this.

				EVA
		She's telling the truth, Mr. 
		McCulloch. I saw her pack it.

	He's surprised to hear this...and so is Tamara.

				MCCULLOCH
		All right. But if it mysteriously 
		disappears en route, I'll have you 
		sent back home the minute we dock. 
		Understood?

				TAMARA
		Perfectly.

	She grabs her purse back from Eva, quickly moving on 
	before he changes his mind. Their voices become whispers.

				TAMARA  
		A major prick.

				EVA
		What are you going to do?

				TAMARA
		Improvise, of course.

	EXT. DOCK PILINGS - SAME TIME  

	as the HOUSEBOAT haphazardly bumps into barnacle-covered 
	dock pilings, still around fifty yards from the cruise 
	ship.

	POINT OF VIEW OUT HOUSEBOAT WINDOW

	The window is splattered with blood, but still clear 
	enough to make out Tamara and Eva walking up the gangway, 
	along with a half dozen other teenagers mingling on 
	board.

	TIGHT ON HOUSEBOAT'S ANCHOR CABLE

	--or rather the remnants of it. It's a piece of frayed 
	woven metal charred by extreme electricity, severed just 
	above water level. Suddenly there's blurry movement 
	behind it; camera RACK FOCUSES just in time to catch a 
	glimpse of JASON SLIPPING OFF THE SIDE, FLOATING TOWARDS 
	THE PILINGS.

	EXT. DOCKSIDE - SAME TIME

	as McCulloch impatiently checks his watch and list again. 
	Miss Van Deusen walks up to him.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked 
		in?

				MCCULLOCH
		Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never 
		showed up. I'm a little concerned.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Don't be. They probably decided to 
		explore each other rather than New 
		York.

	He gives her a disdainful look, starting up the ramp. 

				MCCULLOCH
		Let's go -- we're running two minutes 
		late.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Charles, there's someone else coming 
		along too.

	He stops, following her glance. His face tightens.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Rennie is walking toward them with a small suitcase, her 
	dog Toby striding next to her. She walks up to him, 
	starts to say something, then decides against it. Rennie 
	heads up the gangway. HOLD on McCulloch and Miss Van 
	Deusen. He's livid.

				MCCULLOCH
		You have no right...

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		And neither do you. It's up to Rennie
		to decide what she wants to do.

				MCCULLOCH
		She doesn't know what she wants. She's 
		never had a stable life.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		And she sure doesn't have one now, 
		either. She needs to live.

				MCCULLOCH
		I'm her legal guardian, not you or 
		anybody else, and I alone know what's 
		best for her. End of discussion.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		No, I think it's just the beginning.

	She walks past him.

	EXT. RAMP/SHIP - ON RENNIE

	as she reaches the top of the gangway, her heart 
	pounding. Rennie pauses, working up the courage to look 
	out at the lake again.

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW

	The ROWBOAT she saw earlier is still there, even closer 
	now.

	RENNIE'S PUPILS

	contract, her blood pumping faster. Then she hears a 
	FAINT VOICE BELOW HER...

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Hhhhelp me...

	Rennie looks straight down at the water beneath her and 
	sees:

	AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY 

	floundering in the water. It takes us only a moment to 
	recognize him -- IT'S YOUNG JASON. He's gasping, sucking 
	in huge amounts of liquid, exactly like he did in the 
	prologue.

				YOUNG JASON
		Hhhhelp me....I'm drowning...

	RENNIE

	leans back in terror, falling into Miss Van Deusen.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		What's wrong, Rennie??

	Rennie frantically points over the ramp edge, unable to 
	speak. Miss Van Deusen quickly looks and sees:

	MISS VAN DEUSEN'S POINT OF VIEW

	The water is calm. No Young Jason.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	as Rennie gets a hold of herself.

				RENNIE
		I just got a little dizzy. I'm fine.

	She continues up the ramp. HOLD on Miss Van Deusen, 
	watching her go, somewhat troubled by it. RACK to 
	McCulloch below her, also watching. Extremely concerned.

	RENNIE

	continues along the starboard side, not risking another 
	glance overboard. She passes an older, very deranged DECK 
	HAND, mopping the deck. HOLD on him, his bloodshot eyes 
	following her like a crazed raven.

	INT. BRIDGE - CLOSE ON HARPOON - DAY

	Sharp and rusty, mounted on the wall amidst jagged 
	scaling knives, shark jaws and other artifacts. WIDEN to 
	reveal they are surrounding a navigational chart on the 
	cruise ship's bridge. Admiral Robertson and his CHIEF 
	ENGINEER are preparing for departure, checking the OMEGA 
	satellite computer as well as the LORAN.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
			(checking watch)
		Let's take in the brow.

				CHIEF ENGINEER
		Yes Sir.
			(into intercom phone.)
		Take in the gangway and single up all 
		lines.

	SEAN and MILES enter the room; Sean gets a glance from 
	his Dad. Miles is very impressed with the bridge.

				SEAN
		Hello, Dad.

				MILES
		Hey, Admiral Robertson. Love your 
		ship.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		She's a beauty, isn't she? I should've 
		retired from the Navy ten years ago.

				MILES
		You've really been generous to give us 
		this cruise. I know I speak for 
		everybody on board.

	Everybody...with the possible exception of Sean. He 
	avoids eye contact with his father.

				

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		Hell, there's just twenty or so of you 
		-- we only need a skeleton crew and 
		it's a pleasure to sail her anyway.
			(beat)
		By the way, congratulations on winning 
		the intramural diving championships, 
		Miles. I'm sure you made your old man 
		proud.

	Admiral Robertson gives his own son a glance; maybe Sean 
	should think about doing the same.

				CHIEF ENGINEER
		Have you decided on your departure 
		protocol, Admiral?

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		Actually, I thought I'd leave the 
		honors to my son.

				SEAN
		Dad, I don't think...

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
			(to Chief Engineer, ignoring 
			Sean)
		Relinquishing command of the Princess 
		Ruby to Captain Sean Robertson.

	Sean has no say in the matter. Miles can feel his 
	friend's nervousness as well.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		But before you take the helm, take 
		this.

	He tosses Sean a wrapped box. Sean opens it. Inside is a 
	navigational computer the size of a calculator, sitting 
	next to a rusty old sextant.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		Something old and something new. I 
		used the sextant when I was your age, 
		but now they have these goddamn 
		computers to do all the work for you.

				CHIEF ENGINEER
			(to Sean)
		Have you decided on a plan of 
		departure, Captain?

	Sean's nervous. He eyes the Omega, quickly glancing at 
	the LORAN, briefly referring to the navigational chart.

				SEAN
		How about if we start up the forward 
		engines and come around. 180 
		degrees...

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		Aren't you forgetting something?

	Sean looks flustered. Admiral Robertson storms to a 
	large button, pressing it three times, piercing the air 
	with three long blasts of the ship's horn. It 
	underscores his frustration.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		We're in foggy weather! Send out the 
		international maritime signal that a 
		vessel is backing down, followed by a 
		security broadcast warning other 
		ships!

	He shoves the mike out at Sean, but he doesn't grab it, 
	leaving the bridge, humiliated. There's an awkward moment 
	for Miles, unable to find any appropriate words. He exits 
	as well. Admiral Robertson stares out the bridge window, 
	saddened and frustrated. It wasn't supposed to go this 
	way.

	EXT. DECK - ON SEAN

	as he continues away, his retreat blocked by the DECK 
	HAND. The crazy old man pierces a dead serious stare at 
	Sean.

				DECK HAND
		This voyage is doomed.

				SEAN
		Yeah, tell me about it.

	Sean sidesteps him, moving on.

	EXT. HARBOR - DAY (CRANE SHOT)

	Parents and relatives wave gleefully from the docks as 
	CAMERA RISES AND ROTATES to find eighteen or so teenagers 
	1ining the upper deck, happily waving back. The ship 
	begins to slice through serene water. The voyage has 
	begun.

	CLOSER ON HULL

	The water begins to ripple as the ship's speed increases. 
	All seems normal...until JASON'S HANDS APPEAR, CLINGING 
	TO A LOOSE MOORING LINE DRAGGING IN THE WATER. He 
	slithers up the side towards the deck as dense fog 
	breezes past him.

	EXT. DECK - DAY

	as Sean continues along, hands in pockets. He turns a 
	corner and collides with RENNIE, walking her dog. His 
	eyes instantly brighten, as do hers.

				SEAN
		Rennie...

				RENNIE
		Hi, Sean.

				SEAN
		I heard you weren't coming.

				RENNIE
			(glances at Toby)
		We changed our minds.

	Sean pats her dog. There's an awkward pause...they are 
	obviously in the early stages-of a relationship. 
	Sean reaches into his coat pocket, bringing back a small 
	necklace-sized box.

				SEAN
		I got you a present.

				RENNIE
		But I didn't get you one...

				SEAN
		Forget it. It's a dumb little thing 
		anyway.

	Rennie opens it up, exposing a petite silver necklace 
	with a Statue of Liberty pendant on it. She's touched.

				RENNIE
		Sean...it's beautiful.

	Sean takes it from her, snapping it around her neck.

				SEAN
		I thought maybe we could hike to the 
		top of the Statue when we got there, 
		if you felt like it. It's supposed to 
		be 22 stories tall.

				RENNIE
		I'd love to.

				MCCULLOCH (O.S.)
		Your father was looking for you, Mr. 
		Robertson.

	McCulloch appears behind them. The mood has been broken.

				SEAN
		I guess I'll see you later.

	Sean leaves. McCulloch steps up to Rennie, pointing out 
	to the foggy sea. Her respiration increases as she 
	psyches herself up to look.

				MCCULLOCH
		There's a storm predicted tonight. 

	Rennie looks at the ocean, forcing herself not to turn 
	away.

				MCCULLOCH
		You're making a big mistake, Rennie. 
		It's not too late to put you back on 
		land.

				RENNIE
		I'm staying.

				MCCULLOCH
		If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you 
		were of...

				RENNIE
		She didn't push me into coming.

				MCCULLOCH
		Why are you doing this to yourself?

				RENNIE
		I don't even know why I'm afraid, 
		Uncle Charles. I can't even remember 
		when it started. Don't you think it's 
		time I found out and got over it?

	He takes a measured pause.

				MCCULLOCH
		Facing your fear doesn't always 
		conquer it.

				RENNIE
		I'm staying.

	He's not going to change her mind.

	P.O.V. - RENNIE AND MCCULLOCH (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)

	through a porthole window...and through the viewfinder 
	of a video camcorder. McCulloch shakes his head, turning 
	away from Rennie and walking away. A sinister electric 
	guitar solo screeches out. PAN with McCulloch as he 
	passes the window, coming around 180 degrees into a CLOSE 
	UP of J.J. JARRETT, fingering a sleek Gibson "Flying V."

				J.J.
			(into camera)
		Is this axe awesome or what?

	INT. J.J.'S STATEROOM - DAY

	as J.J., a female rocker in the vein of band "Vixen," 
	continues to wail on her guitar. She's wearing a black 
	leather corset, with wildly teased deep red hair. Holding 
	the camcorder is WAYNE WEBBER, MTV-acclimated, wearing 
	the latest hip prescription glasses.

				WAYNE
		Too cool, J.J. Your parents came 
		through.

	She pops out the guitar cable from her practice amp.

				J.J.
		No lie. I hear there's a big power 
		room down below where I can get 
		supreme concert hall echo. Come down 
		and shoot a basement tape on me, okay?

				WAYNE
		Sure...but I gotta shoot some 
		shockumentary footage first.

	He avoids eye contact when he says it. She gives him a 
	look.

				J.J.
		Man, don't tell me you're still trying 
		to scam on Tamara...

	His non-answer means yes. J.J. walks over to him, 
	grabbing his cheeks, shaking them like jello.

				J.J.
		How long have we known each other? 
		Don't be a dweeb, Wayne. She's not 
		interested in you, only what you can 
		do for her. She's a user.

				WAYNE
		She's sexy.

				J.J.
		So's this guitar. So what?

				WAYNE
		I'll catch you later.

				

	He exits. She mumbles something under her breath, coiling 
	up her amp cord.

	INT. CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH WAYNE

	as he walks onward. DROP DOWN to find his FEET as he 
	passes a DARK ALCOVE...which happens to have SLIMY 
	FOOTPRINTS AND SEAWEED leading into it. Camera FOLLOWS 
	the footprints, RISING again and with dim recognition, 
	our eyes fall on JASON. Lurking in the shadows. But not 
	for long.

	INT. POWER ROOM - DAY

	Massive, very dark, backlit steam seeping from a maze of 
	pipes overhead. No windows. A wall of circuit breakers 
	and voltage meters decorate one wall, quietly humming 
	generators on the opposite side. J.J. appears with her 
	guitar, amp and ghetto blaster, appreciative of the 
	surroundings.

				J.J.
		This place is aching for a video. 
		Wayne, you're an asshole.

	She finds an outlet and plugs in her equipment.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	We're peering at J.J. predatorially through the steam, 
	moving through it, behind the generators.

	J.J.

	pops a cassette into her blaster, jamming the "play" 
	button. A loud rock 'n roll rhythm track blasts out.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	moving around the generators, eyeing her sleek leather 
	pants as she bends over to plug in her axe.

	TIGHT ON ELECTRIC GUITAR

	as J.J. snaps the male end of the plug into the female. 
	receptacle.

	JASON'S FACE

	appears for an instant through the vapor, then vanishes.
				
	J.J.

	screams out the opening licks of her solo in sync with 
	her playback. The generators are causing a breeze which 
	makes her hair dance, steam flowing between her legs. 
	She's lost in her music, building to a crescendo, bending 
	the high "E" string above the upper octave fret. She 
	opens her eyes with the pleasure of it and sees:

	JASON

	emerging from a cloud of vapor like her worst nightmare.

	EXT. UPPER DECK - SAME TIME

	as J.J.'s SCREAM echoes from an exhaust duct. WHIP PAN to 
	find the crazed DECK HAND standing just below it, 
	reacting with dread. He's the only one who has heard it.

	INT. POWER ROOM - SAME TIME

	as Jason tears the guitar off her body, raising it in the 
	air like a hatchet. The horrified girl flees down a 
	narrow maze of steel steps, forced back against a 
	generator with nowhere to go. PUSH IN on her face for one 
	last look at her before:

	JASON

	swings the guitar downward and buries it in J.J.'s skull.

	EXT. UPPER DECK - SAME TIME

	as the Deck Hand flinches upon the thick, dull sound of 
	her demise, followed by discordant feedback from her 
	guitar...and eventual silence. He reaches into his breast 
	pocket, his hand shaking badly as he sips from a flask of 
	Early Times.

	EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (EFX)

	as LIGHTNING FLASHES over a gray, choppy sea. A storm is 
	imminent. The Princess Ruby finally appears, cutting 
	through whitecaps, no land in sight.

	CLOSE UP - INK DIP PEN

	as Rennie's hand carefully dips it in India ink, moving 
	to a blank page in her journal. She hesitates for several 
	beats.

	INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	No inspiration. She puts down the pen, looking at her 
	dog, who's curled up on the bed.

				RENNIE
		What do you think...time for some 
		personal experiences to fuel our 
		minds?

	The dog's eyes blink, but no more than that.

				RENNIE
		I agree.

	Rennie moves to her closet, finding a silk blouse and 
	some black satin pants.

	EXT. OUTSIDE DECK - SAME TIME

	Wind is picking up, sweeping thick mist past a row of 
	decorative flags. One of them flaps back...AND EXPOSES 
	JASON.

	THROUGH JASON'S EYES (FLYING WALL EFX)

	as the flag whips our faces. We MOVE through it, down the 
	empty passageway, coming to a porthole window. Rennie's 
	window. We peer through it with unnerving intensity at 
	the backside of Rennie as she pulls off her T-shirt, 
	slipping on the blouse. Camera continues through the 
	tiny round window, floating across the room, over Toby 
	and the bed...until we're INCHES FROM THE BACK OF 
	RENNIE'S HEAD. She suddenly spins around in fright, 
	facing us point-blank, and:

	REVERSE ANGLE

	Nobody is there, her porthole window empty. But there's 
	something surreal about the window...

	TIGHT ON PORTHOLE WINDOW (EFX)

	Empty grayness...then EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON FLOATS UP FROM 
	BELOW, BUBBLES ESCAPING FROM HIS LIPS. The porthole has 
	become a window into the depths of Crystal Lake.

	RENNIE

	feels her throat catch with terror and an instant later:

	DOG TOBY

	begins to bark vociferously, rushing to her cabin door, 
	scratching to get out.

	RENNIE'S EYES

	are distracted to Toby for a second; when she looks back 
	at the porthole, she sees:

	AN EMPTY WINDOW

	No water, no drowning boy.

	RENNIE

	snaps out of it, moving to the door, where her dog is 
	frantically clawing with his fur up.

				RENNIE
		Okay Toby, calm down...

	She's talking to herself as much as the dog. Rennie 
	closes the curtains on her window, then steps to her 
	door. She swings the door open for Toby...and exposes 
	an empty hall. Toby scrapes his way out of the room, 
	dashing off down the hall, snarling.

	INT. SHIP CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	as Toby runs straight toward us. PAN with him as he 
	rushes around a corner, leading us into a view of TAMARA 
	and EVA, disappearing down a staircase.

	INT. MENS GYM - DAY

	A strong seventeen year-old black kid, JULIUS GAW, is 
	going a few rounds with another senior boy who's clearly 
	losing the boxing match. Julius dances around him on the 
	mat like he's Mike Tyson, several other boys cheering 
	them on.

	REVERSE ANGLE - LOCKER ROOM WINDOW

	as Tamara and Eva step into view. Eva glances around, 
	feeling out of place in the men's locker room.

				EVA
		I'm not sure we're supposed to be 
		here, Tamara.

	A couple of skinny boys wearing only towels walk by. But 
	Tamara doesn't notice them, her face pressed up against 
	the glass, watching Julius.

				TAMARA
		Is that a muscular bod or what?

	Tamara puts on a sexy smile. The other boxer sees her 
	instead, instantly distracted. Julius lays him out with a 
	left-right-left combination. The onlookers applaud. 
	Julius pulls out his mouthpiece, giving Tamara a wicked 
	smile.

				TAMARA
		He's undefeated, you know that?
			(beat)
		Julius is the only senior I'd even 
		consider doing it with. If he wasn't 
		black, that is.

				EVA
			(awkward)
		My parents are open minded about that 
		sort of thing.

				TAMARA
		My stepmom couldn't care less, but 
		Daddy would have a shit fit.
			(lets it slip out)
		He might even pay some attention to 
		me.

	Tamara quickly puts up her veneer again, spotting 
	something.

				TAMARA
		Gorgeous guy at ten o'clock. Look 
		sensual.

	Both girls slip into instant sultry as a CREW MEMBER in 
	his mid-twenties passes them, wearing a tool belt. Very 
	masculine. He gives the girls a pleasant smile. Tamara 
	turns around to check out his back side.

				TAMARA
		I think it's time for some 
		recreational activity, girl.

				EVA
		Sounds good. I hear there's a 
		shuffleboard court on deck -- it might 
		be kinds cool...

				TAMARA
		You're joking, right?

	She wasn't, but Eva tries to act like she was. Tamara 
	walks on, Eva following.

	INT. STATEROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT

	as McCulloch steps from Rennie's room, looking very 
	worried. Wayne Webber passes by, his eye stuck in his 
	viewfinder. McCulloch yanks the camcorder away from his 
	face.

				MCCULLOCH
		Have you seen my niece anywhere?

				WAYNE
		Yeah, motivating downstairs, I think. 
		What's the problem, Mr. McCulloch?

				MCCULLOCH
		Senior predictions started five 
		minutes ago and she hasn't shown up.

				WAYNE
		Some of us don't want our futures 
		predicted.

				MCCULLOCH
		In your case I'm sure that's true.

	He brushes past Wayne angrily.

	INT. SERVICE AREA - NIGHT

	as Tamara drags Eva into a secluded service area, pulling 
	out her mirror, straw and baggie.

				TAMARA
		The night time is the right time. 

	Tamara hands the straw to Eva.

				EVA
			(nervous)
		No thanks.

				TAMARA
		What? Don't be a lightweight...this is 
		top dollar toot.

				EVA
		It's not that, it's just that...
			(beat)
		It I get caught, I'll lose my science 
		scholarship and everything.

				TAMARA
		You're talking to the prom queen, 
		Eva. Do you really think I'm going to 
		risk getting caught?

				EVA
			(a pause)
		I guess not.

				TAMARA
		Do you realize how many people would 
		kill to be sitting here right now? 
		Come on, it's grad night. You've got 
		your whole life to be uptight.

	Eva takes the straw.

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	as we move down the corridor, in and out of shadows, 
	hearing giggles from Tamara and Eva up ahead. Jason's 
	coming...

	ANGLE - TAMARA AND EVA

	as Eva takes a nosefull, sneezing badly.

				TAMARA
		Is that unbelievable or what?

	Tamara giggles, getting ready to tap out another line. 
	But the snickering stops upon the sound of APPROACHING 
	FOOTSTEPS. They both look up, every muscle tensing with 
	fear as:

	RENNIE

	appears from the shadows, just as startled to see them. 
	It's not Jason at all. Rennie can't help noticing the 
	cocaine, trying hard to ignore it.

				TAMARA
		Jesus, you scared the hell out of us.

				RENNIE  
		Have you seen my dog? I think he came 
		this way.

				TAMARA
		No, we haven't.
			(awkwardly)
		Care for a hit?

				RENNIE
		No thanks.

	Rennie continues on. After she's gone...

				TAMARA
		A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll 
		narc on us...

				EVA
		I have her in Creative Writing and 
		she's fairly nice.

				TAMARA
		Nobody related to McCulloch can be 
		nice.

	Tamara puts the straw to her nose.

	ANGLE - RENNIE

	as she presses on, the corridor getting darker.

				RENNIE
		Toby?

	No reply. She walks on, turning down the left hallway... 
	but camera turns down the right hallway. Suddenly JASON 
	REVEALS HIMSELF, quietly stepping from the GAME ROOM. 
	He's holding a pool cue, which he proceeds to snap in 
	half, providing a splintery sharp shaft.

	INT. SERVICE AREA - SAME TIME 

	as Tamara finishes off her line, wiping her nose with a 
	sniffle.

				TAMARA
		Oh yeah. Ready to party and then some.

	She rolls up her baggie, stuffing it into her purse.

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	as we come down a corridor, turning into the Service 
	Area, stomping right up to Tamara and Eva. They both 
	GASP; Tamara drops her mirror, which SHATTERS on the 
	ground.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	They are facing McCulloch.

				MCCULLOCH
		What are you doing in here?

				TAMARA
		Nothing.

	He eyes the broken mirror. He wasn't born yesterday.

				MCCULLOCH
		Are you girls using drugs?

				EVA
		Do you think I would use drugs, Mr. 
		McCulloch? We were just exploring the 
		ship.

	He doesn't want to believe Eva is a druggie. But Tamara 
	is a different matter. He levels his eyes on her.

				MCCULLOCH
		I'11 be coming around your stateroom 
		in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss 
		Mason. You'd better have your biology 
		project ready or I'm phoning your 
		parents.

				TAMARA
		They're out of town.

				MCCULLOCH
		Then I'll make sure you remain on 
		board while your classmates see the 
		sights.

	He's gotten to her with that one. McCulloch storms away.

				EVA
		What are you going to do?

				TAMARA
		Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... 
		but that little narcing bitch niece of 
		his is a different matter.
			(calculating)
		Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid 
		of the water...

	SPLASH!

	as a body pierces the surface of the deck swimming pool. 
	It's MILES, having just completed a dive from the high 
	board. Miss Van Deusen and several others stand at 
	poolside, giving him some applause.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Poetry in motion, Miles.

				MILES
		A half-twist short. I'll hone that 
		dive yet.

	He swims to the side, leading us to a view of Rennie. 
	She's very cautious about getting too close to the pool 
	edge as she approaches Miss Van Deusen.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Rennie -- I was just on my way over to 
		your room

				RENNIE
		Have you seen my dog anywhere?

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		No, but I'm sure Toby's fine. The 
		ship's only so big and there's 
		certainly no way off it, is there?

	She smiles reassuringly, but her words are less than 
	comforting.

	INT. SHIP CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH TOBY - SAME TIME

	as the canine continues to sniff out Jason through the 
	maze of corridors. TRACK with the dog as he slows his 
	pace, knowing he's getting close to something.

	TOBY'S POINT OF VIEW (STEADICAM)

	Low to the ground, creeping past a steam vent which 
	obscures his vision, then turning down a metal staircase, 
	weaving into another passageway. Then with absolutely no 
	warning, A BODY FALLS FROM ABOVE, THUDDING DIRECTLY IN 
	FRONT OF US.

	TOBY

	rears back with teeth bared, but:

	THE BODY

	is quite dead: Toby is snarling at the corpse of the 
	TEENAGE BOXER who lost his bout against Julius. He's 
	still in his boxing shorts...BUT JASON'S SPLINTERY POOL 
	CUE HAS BEEN STABBED THROUGH HIS CHEST.

	EXT. DECK POOL - ON RENNIE AND MISS VAN DEUSEN

	as they walk along the edge of the pool.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		So, are you having fun yet?

				RENNIE
			(lying)
		Yeah...a lot.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		I seem to detect a hint of 
		ingenuousness in your tone.
			(beat)
		In other words, level with me.

				RENNIE
			(a pause)
		There's something I haven't told 
		you...

	...But before she can begin the next sentence, Rennie is 
	shoved from behind.

				

	WATER ANGLE

	as she SPLASHES INTO THE POOL'S DEEP END.

	MISS VAN DEUSEN

	spins around, seeing Tamara standing there with Eva.

				TAMARA
		Wow, sorry...

	RENNIE

	flounders at the surface, nobody realizing the terror 
	she's experiencing. She's too scared to even cry for 
	help.

	MISS VAN DEUSEN

	isn't looking at Rennie, her attention on admonishing 
	Tamara.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Why on earth would you do something 
		like that?

				TAMARA
		It was an accident, I swear...

	Eva avoids eye contact, feeling awful. Sean comes walking 
	up, seeing Rennie.

				SEAN
		What happened?
			(to Rennie)
		Rennie, are you okay?

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW

	She's can't even hear Sean, her vision being splashed by 
	the chlorinated water. She sinks under the surface, 
	turning around...AND COMING FACE TO FACE WITH YOUNG 
	JASON. The eight year-old corpse GRABS HER ANKLE AND 
	TRIES TO DRAG HER DOWN.

	SEAN'S POINT OF VIEW

	as Rennie sinks under the surface, all alone, thrashing 
	in terror.

	SEAN

	realizes she's in trouble. He immediately dives in after 
	her, pulling her to the pool's edge, where Miss Van 
	Deusen helps to lift her out.

	TAMARA AND EVA

	quickly move on.

				TAMARA
		That was truly excellent.

				EVA
			(feels like shit)
		Yeah.

				TAMARA
		Time to check out the waiters.

				EVA
		I think I'll pass. See you later, 
		okay?

				TAMARA
		But...wait a minute!

	Eva walks away. Tamara acts angry, but deep down she's 
	hurt.

				TAMARA
		Some friend you are.

	EXT. POOL SIDE - SAME TIME

	as Sean climbs from the pool to join Miss Van Deusen, who 
	is trying to comfort Rennie.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
			(to Sean)
		Bring her a towel, okay?

	Sean nods, hurrying off as others start to crowd around. 
	Miss Van Deusen looks up at them.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		She's fine -- everybody go back to 
		what you were doing.

	They disperse. Rennie slowly starts to cry, holding tight 
	to her teacher.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Care to talk about it?

	After a moment to compose herself...

				RENNIE
		I can't swim.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		I gathered that.

	Rennie says nothing else. Miss Van Deusen knows she's 
	holding out.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		I had a skiing accident in high 
		school, broke my left leg. It took 
		three winters before I would even look 
		at the snow again...but the solution 
		kept eluding me.
			(beat)
		I finally took lessons. I've never 
		broken a bone since.

				RENNIE
		It's not that simple.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Maybe not. But you're not telling me 
		everything, are you?

				RENNIE
			(long pause)
		Whenever I get near the water, I see 
		this young boy drowning. He tries to 
		pull me down with him.

	The teacher didn't expect this, taking a thoughtful 
	pause.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		When did this start?

				RENNIE
		About four years ago...at Crystal 
		Lake. I spent a few summers there with 
		Uncle Charles inbetween boarding 
		school.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		After your parents passed away?

	Rennie nods somberly.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Did you have an accident in the lake?

				RENNIE
		No. It was just a normal summer. I've 
		never been able to figure it out.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Only one young boy ever drowned in 
		that lake, and that was before you 
		were even born. His name was Jason 
		Voorhees.

	The name has triggered some deep memory...but the 
	recollection vanishes upon the sound of her uncle's 
	voice.

				MCCULLOCH (O.S.)
		Dear God...

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as McCulloch rushes over to Rennie, seeing that she's 
	soaked. He's livid.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...

				MCCULLOCH
		Oh, I can see that. You've done a 
		wonderful job of supervising the kids, 
		Miss Van Deusen.

				RENNIE
		It wasn't her fault.

	He gets Rennie to her feet just as Sean runs back with a 
	towel. McCulloch grabs it from him, wrapping it around 
	his niece, facing both Miss Van Deusen and Sean.

				MCCULLOCH
		Stay away from her...both of you.

	He starts to lead her away. The crazy DECK HAND blocks 
	their path, slipping his flask away.

				DECK HAND
		He's come back and you're all going to 
		die.

	Rennie gazes at the Deck Hand, then back at McCulloch.

				RENNIE
		Just...leave me alone...

	She pulls away from him, hurrying off, confused and 
	frightened. McCulloch's retinas pierce the Deck Hand with 
	scorn. He checks his watch, then storms off.

	INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	as a loud, firm KNOCK punctuates the silence. Then comes 
	a sultry voice...

				TAMARA (O.S.)
		The door's open.

	McCulloch swings it open.

				MCCULLOCH
		I'm in no mood for any more stall 
		tactics, Miss Mason. Where is your 
		final project?

	REVERSE ANGLE

	as Tamara fills a pair of champagne glasses with a bottle 
	of Dom Perignon. She's wearing a full body robe.

				TAMARA
		Wouldn't you like a glass of champagne 
		first, Charles?

	He's about to lose his temper. McCulloch steps closer.

				MCCULLOCH
		Where did you get that alcohol?

				TAMARA
		I packed it. Just for us.

	EXT. DECK CORRIDOR - STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	as we approach Tamara's porthole window, peering through 
	it. We can't hear the words but we can clearly see the 
	people.

	INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS

	as McCulloch takes the bottle from her, setting it down 
	on her nightstand.

				MCCULLOCH
		That's it. You're not setting foot off 
		this ship until we return home.

				TAMARA
		But I haven't even shown you my 
		biology project...

	Tamara unties her robe. PAN DOWN to the floor with it as 
	it softly piles at her bare feet.

	ANGLE - PORTHOLE WINDOW

	as the SHADOW OUTSIDE quickly blurs past the window.

	RETURN TO SCENE

	McCulloch is flabbergasted, too stunned to fully react. 
	Tamara is wearing a layered teddy, which she's beginning 
	to unsnap, exposing her lithe body...but that's not all. 
	Tamara has drawn all her major organs on her bare skin.

				TAMARA
		Take a closer look, Charles. I want to 
		make sure I labeled all my organs 
		correctly.

	EXT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	as we approach her door, still cracked open from 
	McCulloch's entrance. We get there just in time to see 
	Tamara slip her arms around McCulloch, planting her lips 
	on his, pressing her nubile flesh up against his stiffly 
	starched shirt.

	INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS

	as she holds him tight. He finally breaks away in a fit 
	of anger.

				MCCULLOCH
		Oh, you've done it now. Not only are 
		you going home, I'll see to it that 
		you spend next year back in a high 
		school classroom!

	He storms for the door, swinging it open, coming face to 
	face with:

	WAYNE

	who casually lowers his camcorder.

				TAMARA
		I don't think so, Mr. McCulloch.
			(to Wayne)
		Did you get anything good?

	His eyes are unable to leave her nakedness.

				WAYNE
		Oh yeah.

	She quickly slips on her robe again, all business. 
	McCulloch realizes what has just transpired.

				MCCULLOCH
		You'll never get away with it.
			(eyeing Wayne)
		And you can forget about ever 
		attending any film school.
			(serious beat)
		You're both going to be very, very 
		sorry.

	He storms off. Wayne looks very, very nervous. Tamara 
	steps over to him, cuddling up.

				TAMARA
		Relax, Wayne. He won't risk doing a 
		thing.
			(beat)
		Can I have the tape?

	He pops the eject button, absently handing it over. Wayne 
	steps into her room, nervous and excited to be there. He 
	lifts the glass of champagne she poured for McCulloch.

				WAYNE
		This is going to sound supremely 
		lame...but I've had the major hots for 
		you since our sophomore year, Tamara.

	He gulps down the fizz. She forces a smile, stashing the 
	incriminating videotape.

				TAMARA
		That's sweet, Wayne. Look, I'd love to 
		chat but I'm really pressed for time.
			(ushering him to door)
		Let's try to get together later, okey-
		doke?

				WAYNE
		But I thought...

				TAMARA
		Thanks for the camerawork.

	And out he goes, the door shut in his face. Wayne stands 
	outside her room, realizing he's a major chump.

				WAYNE
		Wayne, you're an asshole.

	He despondently exits.

	INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME (STEADICAM)

	as Tamara heads for the bathroom, slipping off her robe. 
	She moves to the shower curtain and we're right behind 
	her. Her hand reaches up, grabbing the curtain, yanking 
	it back...

	Nothing is there.

	INT. LADIES RESTROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT (EFX)

	as Rennie enters, her eyes reddened. She moves to the 
	sink, looking at herself in the mirror. So much for the 
	silk blouse and satin pants, not to mention her soaked 
	hair. Rennie runs some warm water, rinsing her face.

	When she starts to fill her hands a second time, BLOOD 
	POURS OUT THE FAUCET INSTEAD OF WATER. Rennie gasps, 
	jerking up and seeing YOUNG JASON REFLECTED ON THE OTHER 
	SIDE OF THE MIRROR, SPLASHING IN WATER.

				RENNIE
		It's not real, it's not real...

	INT. TAMARA'S SHOWER - SAME TIME

	as water from the shower head SPLASHES CAMERA for a beat 
	before Tamara turns it off.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as Tamara reaches for her robe, slipping it on. Her body 
	paint has been washed off. 
	She steps from the shower, glancing in her vanity mirror 
	AND SEEING THE REAL JASON REFLECTED IN IT. Tamara spins 
	around, looking face to face with JASON IN HER BATHROOM. 
	Just as she SCREAMS:

	INT. LADIES RESTROOM - SAME TIME (EFX)

	Young Jason reaches out to grab Rennie, HIS FIST CRASHING 
	THROUGH THE MIRROR. Right when Rennie SCREAMS:

	INT. TAMARA'S BATHROOM - SAME TIME

	The real Jason SHATTERS TAMARA'S VANITY MIRROR WITH HIS 
	FIST. He grabs a sharp chunk of it, advancing on a 
	whimpering Tamara.

				TAMARA
		Please...please don't...

	Jason raises the shard above her and just as she 
	SHRIEKS...

	CLOSE UP - STEAM WHISTLE OF SHIP

	as it blasts loudly in the bleak stormy night. It begins 
	to rain.

	EXT. LADIES RESTROOM - NIGHT

	as Rennie comes rushing out, right into the arms of. 
	Sean. She clings to him, sobbing as the rain falls over 
	them.

				SEAN
		It's okay...you're going to be okay.

				RENNIE
		I want to go home. I want off this 
		ship.

	After a moment...

				SEAN
		Me too.
			(beat)
		Let's go talk to my Dad.

	He puts his arm around her, leading her toward the 
	bridge.

	INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

	as wind and rain pummel the bridge window.. Admiral 
	Robertson turns to his Chief Engineer.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		Let's kick in the stablilizers, Mr. 
		Carlson, and get the seas off the 
		quarter. These kids are in for one 
		hell of a storm.

				CHIEF ENGINEER
		Yes Sir. Activating comfort cruise 
		mode.

	The Chief Engineer moves to a bank of toggle switches, 
	flipping a row of them.

	TIGHT ON NAVIGATIONAL CHART WALL - SAME TIME

	as a bloodstained HAND silently removes the rusty 
	harpoon hanging above the map.

	ADMIRAL ROBERTSON

	gets a reflective look in his weary eyes.

				ADMIRAL-ROBERTSON
		How olds your boy now, Carlson?

				CHIEF ENGINEER
		Nineteen months.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		A tremendous age. Take some advice 
		from a salty old man: don't push him 
		too hard.

	The Chief Engineer nods with a sympathetic smile as the 
	Admiral steps off the bridge, onto the stormy deck, 
	contemplating the sea. The Chief Engineer moves to the 
	radio/intercom console. He lifts a telephone, punching in 
	a three digit number. PUSH IN TIGHT ON HIS FACE.

				CHIEF ENGINEER
		This is the bridge. Approaching 
		weather suggests we secure the main 
		deck and...

	His sentence is sharply cut off, his head jerking from 
	excruciating, instant pain. 
	His mouth contorts with words no one will ever hear as he 
	stares into the face of:

	JASON

	holding the opposite end of the harpoon. He shoves it 
	forward with one more staccato jerk and:

	CLOSE UP - CHIEF ENGINEER'S BACK

	-- The harpoon's bloody, corroded tip pierces through 
	his once-white uniform.

	ADMIRAL ROBERTSON

	returns to the bridge as LIGHTNING flashes outside.

				ADMIRAL ROBERTSON
		Better have them doublecheck the 
		lifeboat stations as well...

	Admiral Robertson stops cold upon the sight of Mr. 
	Carlson. He hurries over to him, kneeling down, freezing 
	as a pair of MUDDY FEET ENTER FRAME. Admiral Robertson 
	bends his neck upwards to face:

	JASON

	hovering over him, now clutching one of the scaling 
	knives.

	INT. BRIDGE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	as Sean and Rennie walk up the corridor leading to the 
	bridge.

				RENNIE
		Can he really take us home?

				SEAN
		Not completing a voyage is against 
		everything he stands for. But I think 
		I can convince him to call a Coast 
		Guard cutter for you.

				RENNIE
		What about you?

				SEAN
		If I go with you, he'll never
		speak to me again.
			(beat)
		But I'm never going to live up to his 
		expectations anyway...so maybe it's 
		the right thing to do.

	He's made a big decision. Sean takes her hand as they 
	walk on.

	THEIR POINT OF VIEW

	moving closer and closer to the bridge door, having not 
	the slightest inclination of what's in store for them.

	SEAN

	knocks on the bridge door. No answer. He's confused. He 
	pushes the door open but something is blocking it. Sean 
	puts his weight into it, shoving hard.

	INT. BRIDGE

	as the door slides open, Sean stepping inside. His eyes 
	roil downwards upon seeing THE DEAD CHIEF ENGINEER, THE 
	HARPOON PROTRUDING FROM HIS BLOODY CHEST.

				SEAN
		Oh Jesus...Dad??

	Sean looks over at the helm...where his father is still 
	sitting in the swivel chair, his back to them. Silent. 
	Sean sidesteps the Chief Engineer's corpse, moving toward 
	his father as Rennie remains frozen in shock.

	SEAN'S POINT OF VIEW

	Slowly walking toward Admiral Robertson...at least he 
	thinks it's his dad because he's unable to see his 
	face. Is it Jason now wearing the uniform?? When he's 
	about two feet away from him...

	SEAN

	reaches out and swivels the chair around. It is his 
	father BUT HIS THROAT HAS BEEN SLIT. Sean staggers 
	backwards, uncomprehending, his senses overloaded. We 
	MOVE with him until he's backed into Rennie, clutching 
	onto him tightly.

				SEAN
		He's...he's dead...

	INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME

	as Miss Van Deusen steps up to Rennie's door, gently 
	knocking.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Ronnie? I just came by to see how you 
		were feeling...

	No answer. She knocks harder...and it creaks open, 
	unlocked.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Rennie...?

	Suddenly the door is jerked from her grasp and swung 
	open. MCCULLOCH is standing on the other side of it.

				MCCULLOCH
		I thought I told you to stay away from 
		her.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
			(holds her ground)
		Where is she?

				MCCULLOCB
			(accusing)
		That's a very good question and I'd 
		appreciate an answer.

	A LOUD BUZZER blares out of an intercom speaker next to 
	their heads, causing the teachers to both jump. Sean's 
	unsteady voice immediately follows.

				SEAN (V.O.)
		Attention everybody, attention. This 
		is Sean Robertson...

	EXT. SWIMMING POOL - SAME TIME

	Miles is toweling off under the shelter of a gazebo as 
	Sean's voice blares out of a rain-pounded megaphone 
	speaker nearby.

				SEAN (V.O.)
		There's been...
			(swallows)
		What I mean is, this is an 
		emergency...

	Miles knows he can't be joking around. Wayne comes 
	walking by, covering his camcorder with his jacket.

				WAYNE
		Miles -- have you seen J.J.? She was 
		supposed to be jamming down in the 
		power room but...

	Miles gestures for him to be quiet, listening very 
	worriedly.

				SEAN (V.O.)
		Repeat, this is an emergency...

	INT. GYM LOCKERS - SAME TIME

	as JULIUS and two other senior boys finish dressing after 
	a shower, hearing Sean's words reverberate around them.

				SEAN (V.O.)
		I want everybody to meet on the 
		bridge...

				JULIUS  
		What the fuck is this?

	The others shrug, concerned.

	EXT. SHUFFLEBOARD COURT - SAME TIME

	The wooden shuffleboard disks are drowning in 
	precipitation. Eva stands alone in the rain, staring at 
	the court as Sean's voice continues.

				SEAN (V.O.)
		Stay calm, but get here as quick as 
		possible. Walk with a friend if you 
		can...

	Eva wipes the rain from her face, then walks away.

	INT. BRIDGE - ON SEAN

	trying his best to keep it together. He glances at his 
	dead father, still unable to believe it.

				SEAN (V.O.)
		God, I wish this was a joke, but it's 
		not.

	Sean slowly puts down the phone. He's lost in a daze. 
	Suddenly the SHIP LURCHES, a huge swell SPLASHING THE 
	BRIDGE WINDOW. Admiral Robertson's body falls from the 
	swivel chair.

				RENNIE
		What is happening???

	Sean regains his balance, moving to the computer console, 
	looking at the OMEGA and LORAN like he's never seen them 
	before.

				SEAN
		I don't know...we've gone off course 
		or something...

				RENNIE
		What do you mean???

	Another wave hammers the bow. She's in a state of awful 
	panic.

				SEAN
		I don't know what I mean! All's I know 
		is that there's no one guiding this 
		ship anymore...

	Sean is starting to lose it. The fear of the ocean 
	guiding her, Rennie rushes to him, gripping and shaking 
	him.

				RENNIE
		Can't you call for help??

	Sean tries to get a grip and assess the situation, pacing 
	frenetically.

				SEAN
		I think so. But we have to lower the 
		anchors so we don't drift any 
		further...

				RENNIE
		Where are they?

				SEAN
		The bow...front of the ship. There's a 
		hoist on each side that lowers them

	She starts to exit.

				SEAN
		I didn't mean for you to go!

				RENNIE
		Just radio for help, okay???

	She hurries out the door, working on terror-induced 
	adrenaline. Sean rushes to the radio console, depressing 
	the keying button, speaking into the mike.

				SEAN
		Mayday, mayday, mayday...

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as JULIUS arrives with the others from the locker room. 
	They react to the dead bodies while Sean continues at the 
	radio.

				SEAN
		Please...can anybody out there hear 
		me??

	No response. WAYNE and MILES rush in.

				MILES
		Sean, what's going on?

	Then he sees the corpses. He needs no further answer.

				WAYNE
		Jesus Christ...

	He's too scared to even videotape it. Sean is bombarded 
	with questions as he tries to figure out the radio.

				JULIUS
		Who did this, man?

				WAYNE
		Is the radio even working??

				MILES
		Isn't there some international S.O.S. 
		thing you can do???

				SEAN
			(suddenly remembers)
		Channel 16...the distress frequency...
			(dialing knob)
		Mayday, mayday, mayday...this is the 
		Princess Ruby. Please, somebody 
		answer...

	EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (STOCK)

	as a COAST GUARD CUTTER tracks through stormy seas.

				RADIO OFFICER (V.O.)
		This is Coast Guard cutter Dallas. 
		What is the nature of your problem, 
		Ruby?

	INT. BRIDGE - ON SEAN AND OTHERS

	as they hear the voice, reacting, relieved and thrilled.

				SEAN
		The Captain and Chief Engineer... 
		they've been...they're dead.

				RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
			(a grave-pause)
		What is your location?

				SEAN
		I...I don't know...

				RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
		Is your ship equipped with Omega 
		satellite navigation or LORAN?

				SEAN
		Yes...

				RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
		The LORAN has a digital printout of 
		your latitude and longitude. Give me 
		the coordinates and we'll be there as 
		quick as we can.

	Sean hurries to the LORAN, reading the numbers.

	EXT. DECK - RADIO ANTENNA - SAME TIME (EFX)

	as LIGHTNING STRIKES above it in the night sky. Camera 
	slowly ADJUSTS to find the RADIO ANTENNA CABLE. A second 
	later, JASON'S HAND REACHES FOR IT, GETTING A FIRM GRASP.

	INT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME

	as Sean hurries back to the radio, pressing it against 
	his spitless mouth.

				SEAN
		I've got the numbers.

				RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
		Give me the degrees first, followed by 
		minutes and sec...

	Suddenly his voice is CUT OFF, followed by STATIC.

				SEAN
		Hello? Are you there??

	No response. A lump sinks into everyone's throat.

	EXT. DECK - RADIO ANTENNA

	as Jason drops the cable he's just torn out, marching 
	onward.

	EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

	as McCulloch bursts onto the bridge, followed by Miss Van 
	Deusen.

				MCCULLOCH
		I demand to know what is going on...

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Oh dear God...

	She's seen the bodies. McCulloch follows her glance, 
	paling. He quickly takes charge, pushing through the 
	students.

				MCCULLOCH
		Where's the radio?

				SEAN
		It's...dead.

				DECK HAND (O.S.)
		You're all going to die.

	All heads spin as the deranged DECK HAND treads out from 
	a shadowy corridor.

				DECK HAND
		You're the last ones. He's come back 
		for you.

				MCCULLOCH
		What are you talking about?

	The Deck Hand takes a final swig from his flask, dropping 
	it with unsteady hands.

				DECK HAND
		Jason Voorhees.

	There is a collective, disconcerting silence triggered by 
	the infamous name.

				MCCULLOCH	 
		You're insane, old man. Jason Voorhees 
		has been dead for over thirty years.

				DECK HAND
		He walks this ship, here and now.

				MCCULLOCH
		A killer walks this ship indeed. And 
		it's certainly none of us...

	The crazed old man gets his drift. Everyone looks at him 
	suspiciously. McCulloch grabs a SCALING KNIFE off the 
	wall, taking a step towards him.

				DECK HAND
		You're the one who's insane!!

	The raving man flees back the way he came. McCulloch 
	raises the flare gun; Miss Van Deusen grabs McCulloch's 
	arm, stopping him.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		What are you doing??

				MCCULLOCH
		That lunatic has been spouting off 
		about Jason since we boarded... 
			(eyeing bodies)
		It's no coincidence.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		But that doesn't prove that he's the 
		one!

				MCCULLOCH
		Walking corpses are not real!

				JULIUS
		Yeah, well these dead bodies are sure 
		enough real.
			(to the others)
		I say we regroup and find this 
		motherfucker before he finds us. 

	There's a murmur; it makes sense.

				MCCULLOCH
		You'll do no.such thing and watch your 
		mouth, young man! I'm in charge here!

	They all look at McCulloch defiantly.

				JULIUS
		School's out, McCulloch.
			(to the others)
		Let's go.

	Julius walks off the bridge; all the seniors follow 
	except Sean.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Please everybody, stay here!!

	They don't listen. McCulloch starts to go after 
	them...and then it hits him:

				MCCULLOCH
		Christ...where's Rennie??

				SEAN
		She's...she's dropping the anchors. I 
		thought the Coast Guard could find us 
		easier if...

				MCCULLOCH
		What?? You sent her out there with a 
		murderer running around loose??

	EXT. DECK - NIGHT

	as Rennie moves past wet, empty lounge chairs towards the 
	bow. She passes a row of translucent windows. The first 
	three are normal...but the fourth has the SILHOUETTE OF 
	JASON ON ITS OPPOSITE SIDE. 
	He begins to stride parallel to her, then disappears 
	when the windows end and a wall takes over.

	INT. BRIDGE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	as Julius and his followers continue on, passing Eva, 
	who's coming up from a staircase. She stops Wayne.

				EVA
		What's going on? I heard on the P.A. 
		system that...

				WAYNE
			(interrupting)
		The Captain's been murdered. The buzz 
		is that Jason might be on board.

				EVA
		Jason...Voorhees?

	She knows the legend as weld as everybody else. Wayne 
	nods gravely, moving to catch up with the others. Eva 
	rushes up to him again.

				EVA
		Have you seen Tamara?

				WAYNE
		No. And I'm not losing any sleep over 
		it.

				EVA
		But she might be in trouble...

				WAYNE
		So what else is new?
			(beat)
		Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude 
		to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise 
		up -- it's not hip to be her friend.

				EVA
		I don't care about being hip anymore.

	She means it. Wayne nods with understanding.

				WAYNE
		I'm sorry, but I've gotta find J.J.

	He hurries on.

	EXT. BOW - NIGHT

	as Rennie appears, fighting the wind and rain to get 
	closer to the anchor hoists.

	POINT OF VIEW THROUGH DECK WINDOW - SAME TIME

	--spying on Rennie like a wolf watching a lamb. We MOVE a 
	few windows down, getting a better view of her.

	REVERSE ANGLE - ON JASON

	deciding that the time is right to strike. His hand moves 
	to the bow entrance door knob, slowly turning it, pulling 
	it open.

	EXT. BOW - ON RENNIE

	moving closer to the right anchor hoist, her back to us 
	as well as Jason. She climbs behind the hoist, looking at 
	the consoles. Then suddenly a BARK.

				RENNIE
		Toby?

	She turns, catching a glimpse of her dog running down the 
	side of the deck. Rennie leaves the hoist, going after 
	Toby.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	through the crack in the door, watching Rennie 
	unexpectedly take off. He's about to move after her when 
	ha hears:

				EVA (O.S.)
		Tamara? Are you around here anywhere?

	Jason quietly closes the door. Rennie will have to wait.

	INT. CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH EVA

	as she cautiously walks along, poking her head in every 
	alcove.

				EVA
		Tamara?

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	moving down the same corridor, catching a glimpse of Eva 
	before she turns a corner and disappears.

	INT. HALLWAY/TAMARA'S STATEROOM - MOVING WITH EVA 
	(STEADICAM)

	Eva steps into the hallway outside Tamara's stateroom. 
	She walks up to Tamara's door, knocking on it. It swings 
	open, unlocked.

				EVA
		Tamara?
			(no response)
		I just want to talk with you.

	She steps into Tamara's room and we go in with her. The 
	quarters are empty. Eva stands there for a beat, confused 
	and scared. She's about to leave when a CREAKING SOUND 
	causes her to look back at:

	THE BATHROOM DOOR

	It slowly swings open...splashing Eva's eyes with 
	grotesque multi-images of Tamara: SHE IS HANGING ON THE 
	DOOR HOOK, HER BODY PIN-CUSHIONED WITH A DOZEN MIRROR 
	SRARDS.

	EVA

	shrieks, running back out the door...

	INT. STATEROOM HALLWAY

	...and sliding to a abrupt halt because JASON IS STANDING 
	AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY. He moves toward Eva like a 
	bulldozer. She turns a rapid 180 and sprints in retreat.

	RUNNING WITH EVA (HAND HELD)

	Gasping for oxygen, Eva has no time to even scream as she 
	flees from the monster, erratically turning down a spiral 
	staircase and running on.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (STEADICAM)

	chasing after her with the smooth determination of a 
	shark, never letting her get too far in the lead.

	INT. BOWELS OF SHIP - ON EVA

	Empty for a second, then Eva appears, weaving her way 
	through a maze of corridors and passageways. She races 
	past a sign directing passengers to "CLUB RUBY."

	ANGLE - JASON

	--entering the same corridor a beat after Eva exits it in 
	the direction of the disco. He tramples onward.

	INT. CORRIDOR/DISCO (STEADICAM)

	The thudding low frequency of a mesmerizing dance tune 
	precedes Eva as she tears open a door, entering the 
	corridor. MOVE BACKWARDS WITH HER as she rushes forward, 
	curving through the shallow passageway and emptying out 
	onto a high tech DISCO FLOOR. A flashing Star Wars 
	lighting system assaults her all directions along with 
	the music. She's all alone in here.

	TIGHT ON EVA

	The lights strobing across her face only accentuate her 
	terror. She spots another door on a small stage, rushing 
	to it. It's locked.

	CROOKED ANGLE - ENTRANCE DOOR

	as Jason enters the corridor, SLAMMING THE DOOR SHUT 
	BEHIND HIM.

	EVA

	decides this is the wrong place to be. She moves for the 
	corridor again and:

	JASON

	appears on the corridor steps for a brief second. The 
	spotlight goes black, then flashes on again. Now he's 
	gone.

	EVA

	backs away, sliding along the edge of the dance floor 
	like she's on a building ledge. Chaser lights and mirror 
	balls fondle her body as she moves as far away from the 
	point where she last saw him. But:

	JASON

	illuminates only ten feet from her, a crimson strobe 
	assaulting his hockey mask. She's on a collision course 
	with him.

	EVA  

	whirls dizzily to the center of the dance floor upon the 
	sight of him. Camera SPINS with her in 360 degree arcs, 
	PUSHING IN on her face.

	EVA'S POINT OF VIEW

	spiraling counter-clockwise on the dance floor, flashes 
	of Jason materializing where she least expects to see 
	him. And getting closer. Finally at the point of 
	exhaustion:

	EVA

	stops, looking everywhere.

	EVA'S POINT OF VIEW

	He seems to be gone. She catches her breath...then 
	sensing his presence, she revolves a half-turn to face:

	THE HOCKEY MASK

	exploding under a pin spotlight, standing directly 
	before her. His forearms recoil with lightning speed as 
	he grips her throat...

	WIDE SHOT - DISCO

	Thundering music. Frantic lights. And Jason and Eva at 
	the center of it all. HER FEET ARE TWENTY-FOUR INCHES OFF 
	THE GROUND, KICKING MADLY AS THE LIFE IS BEING CHOKED OUT 
	OF HER. Finally Eva's legs go rag doll limp. Jason flings 
	her to the ground like a sack of flour. This dance is 
	over.

	EXT. DECK - NIGHT

	Rennie appears again, scanning her no-visibility 
	surroundings.

				RENNIE
		Toby? Where'd you go?

	No sign of her dog. She remembers her mission, heading to 
	the anchors again.

	EXT. BOW - CONTINUOUS

	as Rennie arrives on the bow, climbing into the left 
	hoist box behind the huge anchor cable.

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	moving up to the bow door like Jason did before, cracking 
	it open, seeing Rennie from behind. And moving towards 
	her.

	RENNIE

	is oblivious as she reads the directions above the 
	controls.

	INSERT - HOIST LEVER (SECOND UNIT)

	as Rennie's hand grabs it, shoving it forward.

	INSERT - GREEN HOIST BUTTON (SECOND UNIT)

	A moment later, her thumb finds it and depresses it.

	INSERT - ANCHOR CHAIN (SECOND UNIT)

	as the massive black chain links thunder to life.

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	He's now within ten feet of the unaware girl.

	RENNIE

	remains in the hoist box, making certain it is operating 
	correctly. A second later, we see the fleeting outline of 
	a HUMAN SHAPE appear behind her.

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	Three feet from Rennie. She spins around to climb out of 
	the hoist box and GASPS.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	She's facing MCCULLOCH. He immediately reaches past her, 
	yanking the lever back to its center position, and:

	THE ANCHOR CHAIN (SECOND UNIT)

	grinds to a halt.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	as McCulloch faces her, angrily grabbing Rennie's arms, 
	shouting over the storm.

				MCCULLOCH
		You had me worried to death!

				RENNIE
		But Sean said...

				MCCULLOCH
		I'm the one you should be listening 
		to! Do you think dropping an anchor in 
		the middle of a storm makes any sense 
		whatsoever?

	She tries to find some defense, but McCulloch leads her 
	off before any wards come forth.

	CLOSE UP - EXERCISE MAT

	as a pair of SKEET RIFLES, three FIRE AXES, a FLARE GUN 
	and several POOL CUES are dumped onto the foam padded 
	plastic.

	INT. EXERCISE ROOM - NIGHT

	where Julius has gathered his small group of vigilantes, 
	including Miles and Wayne.

				JULIUS
		I managed to scrounge this shit from 
		the game room and hallways. Grab what 
		you want.

	Wayne takes one of the rifles; Miles grabs the axe.

				WAYNE
		What are you taking, Julius?

				JULIUS
			(flexes fists)
		Nothin'.

				WAYNE
			(dead serious)
		We're talking the possibility of Jason 
		Voorhees here.

	Julius pauses. He's not stupid.

				JULIUS
		Nothin' but this gun.

	He reaches down, picking up the other rifle. And they 
	move.

	INT. STATEROOM HALLWAY/RENNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	as McCulloch guides his niece down the hallway, swinging 
	her door open.

				RENNIE
		Can't we at least talk about it?

				MCCULLOCH
		I refuse to discuss this ridiculous 
		notion that a ghoul is terrorizing 
		this ship.

				RENNIE
		But what about the drowning boy I've 
		been seeing?

	He avoids eye contact. McCulloch takes her hand, ushering 
	her across the threshold. She's standing inside her room 
	now; he's in the hallway.

				MCCULLOCH
		Whatever you've been...imagining... 
		has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.
			(pause)
		I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's 
		all I care about.

				RENNIE
		I'm not staying in my room, Uncle 
		Charles.

				MCCULLOCH
		This isn't a request.

	He closes the door on her face, pulling out a key, 
	locking the dead bolt. She pounds on it from the other 
	side.

				RENNIE (O.S.)
		Uncle Charles!

	He ignores her, briskly walking away.

	INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME

	as she throws her fists against the door a final time, 
	realizing it's futile.

	INT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT

	Steam continues to seep from the maze of criss-crossing 
	pipes. Wayne appears on one of the catwalks. He's holding 
	the skeet rifle under one arm, using the sun gun off his 
	video camera to guide him.

				WAYNE
		J.J. -- you down here?

	CLOSER ANGLE

	as Wayne carefully lets his light guide him down the 
	precarious walkway. An unexpected blast of steam scares 
	the crap out of him, causing him to stumble.

	INSERT - WAYNE'S GLASSES (SECOND UNIT)

	--They slip off the bridge of his nose, skittering down 
	through the catwalk and pipes to God knows where.

	WAYNE

	lies helplessly on the metal grid work, realizing his 
	bleak predicament has just been squared. He pulls himself 
	to a standing position again.

				WAYNE
		We got a major problem, Wayne.

	WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW

	His vision now gives him shadows and shapes rather than 
	crisp images. He raises the gun and continues unsteadily 
	forward.

	POINT OF VIEW THROUGH GRID WORK

	as Wayne inches forward. Camera slowly PANS INTO A 
	PROFILE OF JASON, watching him from a catbird seat.

	WAYNE

	takes another step, almost tripping on a set of stairs 
	leading down to the next level. And when he arrives 
	there...

	WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW

	...A LARGE FIGURE STEPS OUT, HOLDING WHAT APPEARS TO BE A 
	KNIFE.

	WAYNE

	instantly raises the rifle and FIRES...

	WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW

	...and the body goes down. He's hit him!

	WAYNE

	stands there, breathing some relief. He gets an idea, 
	looking through his camcorder eyepiece. Wayne begins to 
	adjust the eyepiece diaptor.

	WAYNE'S POINT OF VIEW (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)

	as the figure on the ground slips in and out of focus, 
	finally becoming crisp. WAYNE HAS SHOT A CREW MEMBER -- 
	the same good looking one Tamara and Eva ogled earlier. 
	He's holding a screwdriver from his waist band tool set, 
	not a knife.

	WAYNE

	slowly lowers his camera as his heart rises into his 
	throat.

				WAYNE
		No...

	He raises his camcorder again, hoping a second view will 
	reveal a dead Jason rather than this young man.

	WAYNE'S POINT OF VIEW (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)

	He gets half his wish: a HOCKEY MASK NOW FILLS HIS 
	FRAME...but Jason is far from dead. Wayne catches a split-
	second glimpse of Jason's fist coming towards him, then 
	the camera is KNOCKED FROM HIS EYE AND THE WORLD BECOMES 
	DARK AND BLURRY.

	WAYNE

	screams, blindly running as fast as he can. He trips, 
	picking himself up, stumbling down the catwalk stairs. 
	Wayne makes it about ten feet before he stumbles over 
	something, bringing with it a harsh strum from an 
	ELECTRIC GUITAR.

	ANGLE - WAYNE'S FEET

	Sure enough, his left shoe is resting on the pickups of a 
	blood-streaked Gibson Flying V.

	TIGHT ON WAYNE

	--sprawled out on the metal floor. He gropes around, his 
	hands feeling something. It sends chills from his groin 
	up through his scalp.

				WAYNE
		No no no...

	REVERSE ANGLE

	Wayne's hands are touching J.J.'S BLOODY FACE, A LARGE 
	CRACK IN HER SKULL. He doesn't have time to scream or cry 
	because

	JASON

	hoists him off of J.J.'s body and flings him into:

	THE SHIP CIRCUIT PANEL (EFX)

	which shorts out with a fanfare of ELECTRICAL SPARKS 
	AND FIRE, INSTANTLY FRYING WAYNE.

	INT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME

	as the overhead lights briefly flicker, then resume 
	normal operation. Sean stands opposite the navigational 
	chart, ping-ponging between it and the ship's 
	computers as Miss Van Deusen paces nervously.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		What was that??

				SEAN
			(very worried)
		I don't know.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
			(trying not to panic)
		What happens if we don't get control 
		of the ship, Sean? I want you to tell 
		me the truth.

				SEAN
			(beat)
		We could hit a reef, collide with 
		another ship...we could be out here 
		for weeks before anybody spotted us.

	They are suddenly jolted with a DOOR SLAM as McCulloch 
	storms onto the bridge.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Did you find Rennie?

				MCCULLOCH
		She's locked safe in her room, no 
		thanks to either of you.
			(like Sean isn't even in the 
			room)
		Has he brought it back on course yet?

	Sean doesn't look at him, still trying to assimilate the 
	wall of components.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		He's doing the best he can, Charles.

				MCCULLOCH
		He's the son of the Captain, for 
		Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able 
		to operate this thing!

	Sean closes his eyes, trying to keep from losing his mind 
	and temper. A fierce WAVE slaps the windows in front of 
	Sean's face, motivating him to get his shit together. He 
	checks the Omega and LORAN.

				MCCULLOCH
		Well?

	Sean doesn't answer, moving to the seat behind the helm. 
	His father's seat. Sean takes the chair, adjusting the 
	wheel, watching the compass. He studies a series of 
	buttons on the console.

	CLOSE UP - WALL OF BUTTONS

	We PAN across them, stopping on one labeled "FIRE ALARM - 
	DO NOT BREAK EXCEPT IN CASE OF EMERGENCY." Camera 
	continues around to find we are in the POWER ROOM, NOT on 
	the bridge. Our vision suddenly lands on JASON, staring 
	at the alarm button, considering. He glances back over 
	his shoulder.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)

	Wayne's body is NOW ON FIRE...AND THE BLAZE IS SPREADING 
	THROUGH THE ROOM.

	INT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME

	as Sean makes up his mind, flipping several toggle 
	switches.

	INSERT - AUTO PILOT COMPUTER

	as Sean flips the last toggle and a green light 
	illuminates, indicating the AUTO PILOT is in effect.

	RETURN TO SHOT

				SEAN
		It worked...we're back on course!

	Sean feels his confidence instantly rejuvenated. Miss Van 
	Deuten immediately embraces him. But a fraction of time 
	later:

	TIGHT ON FIRE ALARM BUTTON

	Jason's fist SMASHES the alarm button...

	INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

	...and a LOUD SIREN cries out across the entire vessel. 
	The blood drains from Sean's face.

				MCCULLOCH
		What's that?

				SEAN
		The fire alarm...

	VARIOUS ANGLES ON BOARD SHIP - NIGHT

	as the shrieking alarm assaults the main deck, hallways 
	and corridors, giving Julius, Miles and Wayne deep 
	pause for thought.

	INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME

	as the alarm bombards Rennie's ears like everybody 
	else's. She hurries to her curtained porthole window, 
	working up the energy to look outside. Rennie gets a grip 
	on them, FLINGING THEM OPEN. The DECK HAND'S CRAZED FACE 
	IS GAZING BACK AT HER. Rennie screams; a second later he 
	hurries off.

	INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

	as McCulloch tears open a cabinet door labeled EMERGENCY 
	FLARE GUN. The siren continues to blast.

				MCCULLOCH
		Can you shut that damn thing off??

	Sean moves to a bank of switches, his eyes darting around 
	for the appropriate switch. Miss Van Deusen sees 
	McCulloch remove the FLARE GUN from the cabinet.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		We already thought of that -- nobody 
		could possibly see it in this storm...

				MCCULIACH
		There's only one person who needs to 
		see it. And I'm going to find him.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		What about the fire??

				MCCULLOCH
		I doubt very much that one even 
		exists.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		What are you talking about?

				MCCULLOCH
		Use some common sense! Setting off a 
		fire alarm causes panic...the same 
		kind of panic caused by suggesting 
		Jason Voorhees is on board.
			(resolved)
		Enough is enough. 

	He marches out the door. Sean finds the alarm kill 
	switch, flipping it. The excruciating siren vanishes. He 
	grabs a pair of rain jackets, tossing one to Miss Van 
	Deusen.

				SEAN
		We have to get everybody together just 
		in case the fire's for real.

	Sean heads for the door, shoving it forward.

	EXT. DECK - ON DOOR

	as it slams open...and JULIUS steps out, not Sean, from a 
	different deck door. TRACK with him as he treads along 
	the side of the ship, skeet rifle raised.

	JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW

	walking past the lifeboat stations, the wind and 
	precipitation battering the small boats. With no warning, 
	AN OBSCURE FIGURE LEAPS OUT, GRIPPING AN AXE.

	JULIUS

	shoves the gun stock into his shoulder and takes 
	instantaneous aim...but he doesn't shoot. He slowly 
	lowers the rifle.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as MILES lowers the axe. They've just scared the shit out 
	of each other.

				MILES
		I'll take the upper deck.

	Julius nods. They separate. Neither boy notices the 
	smoke which is starting to emerge from a deck vent...

	INT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT (EFX)

	Filled with black smoke. The fire is spreading 
	dangerously close to a series of hoses attached to a fuel 
	pump, leading to tanks below. A sign over them reads: 
	DANGER - FUEL TANKS.

	EXT. DECK POOL - NIGHT

	--steaming and far from calm as the weather blitzes it. 
	Miles appears, climbing a ladder to the upper deck level.

	POINT OF VIEW THROUGH LADDER

	Someone is spying on Miles from below, watching his every 
	step.

	EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS

	as Miles arrives, axe raised. He pauses to regard his 
	surroundings, then moves on. RACK FOCUS TO FIND JASON 
	RIGHT BEHIND HIM, having followed Miles up the stairs.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Only darkness and rain for a beat, then Miles 
	materializes, curving around the gargantuan smokestack. 
	He passes us and we SWING AROUND, now looking at the back 
	of his head. He takes three more steps and JASON STEPS 
	INTO THE FOREGROUND. Miles senses his presence and JERKS 
	AROUND, RAISING THE AXE, BRINGING IT DOWN ON JASON'S 
	HEAD...

	...but Jason easily grabs the axe handle before it makes 
	contact, flinging it away.

	EXT. LOWER DECK - ON JULIUS

	He's pacing along when a clattering noise from above 
	makes him stop. Suddenly MILES' AXE THUDS INTO THE 
	MAHOGANY DECK NEXT TO HIS FOOT. Julius gazes at it, 
	jerking his head upward.

				JULIUS
		Miles??

	His answer is a LOUD CRACK OF LIGHTNING. At the same 
	time:

	RUNNING WITH MILES

	He's scrambling as fast as he can across the slippery 
	deck as the monster relentlessly pursues him.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	He's having no problem catching up to the defenseless 
	teenager.

	EXT. DECK STAIRS - SAME TIME

	as Julius zooms up them to aid his comrade.

	EXT. RADAR MAST - NIGHT

	as Miles slides up to the mast and begins scaling it. He 
	glances downward and sees:

	MILES' POINT OF VIEW

	Jason is right at his heels.

	MILES

	slips on a rung, regains control, and continues upward. 
	He makes it three more steps, almost at the uppermost 
	point when JASON GRABS THE BACK OF HIS COAT, TEARING HIM 
	OFF THE MAST.

	STUNT FREEFALL

	Miles cries out as he FREEFALLS BACKWARDS, somersaulting 
	and twisting like he's doing one of his better dives...

	CLOSE UP - MILES' FACE  

	...Empty space for a half-second, then MILES' FACE JOLTS 
	INTO FRAME with a look of ultimate agony. Something has 
	abruptly stopped his fall. Something quite fatal.

	EXT. DECK - ON JULIUS

	coming around a corner, stopping dead in his tracks, his 
	stomach wrenching as his eyes fall on:

	MILES (EFX)

	...who is staring right back at him with dead pupils. 
	MILES HAS BEEN HORRIBLY IMPALED OM A SHIP FLAGPOLE.

	JULIUS

	doesn't get the chance to grasp the reality of it because 
	JASON'S HAND GRIPS HIS SHOULDER, SPINS HIM AROUND AND 
	SLUGS HIM SQUARELY IN THE FACE. The force of it sends the 
	boxer REELING BACKWARDS OFF THE RAILING...

	EXT. STORMY OCEAN (TANK)

	...and Julius SPLASHES INTO THE ROUGH SEA. He's quickly 
	swallowed by the torrential waters.

	INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	as Rennie's HAND jiggles her doorknob again, confirming 
	that it's locked tight. RISE to find her desperate face; 
	she begins furiously pacing and we DOLLY BEHIND HER 
	...but Rennie stops cold upon hearing:

				YOUNG JASON (O.S.)
		Hhhhelp....me....

	Rennie whirls into a CLOSE UP, staring with disbelief at:

	YOUNG JASON (EFX)

	...who is standing on the oval rug in her stateroom, his 
	hands reaching out to her. But then comes the 
	inexplicable: THE OVAL RUG TURNS INTO LAKE WATER AND 
	JASON SINKS INTO IT. He's drowning in the middle of her 
	room, choking on murky water.

				YOUNG JASON
		Hhhhelp me....I'm drowning...

	RENNIE

	stands frozen, feeling herself drawn to him like a 
	magnet. She crawls to the edge of her rug, which is now a 
	deep lake, and extends her arms to him.

	YOUNG JASON

	grabs her hand, pulling hard, then grinning wide.

	RENNIE

	feels the skin on her face crawling off her skull, her 
	eyes expanding because she's now looking at:

	HERSELF!

	Rennie is holding onto herself, about four years younger 
	in a bathing suit, drowning in the lake. YOUNG RENNIE.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		Hhhhelp....me....

	RENNIE

	screams with guttural fear, letting go of herself, 
	watching her younger self drown in the hole in her room.

	YOUNG RENNIE

	disappears under the surface of the water...which seconds 
	later CHANGES BACK INTO HER OVAL RUG.

	NEW ANGLE

	as Rennie moves away, tears rolling down her face, 
	utterly confused. She backs against the wall next to her 
	porthole window and THE REAL JASON'S FIST SMASHES THROUGH 
	THE WINDOW, GRABBING HER THROAT. Rennie struggles, 
	gasping for air as he attempts to strangle her.

	CLOSE ON RENNIE'S HAND

	groping for a weapon to stop him, her fingers skittering 
	across her table like a spider.

	TWO SHOT - RENNIE AND JASON

	Her head is pulled taut against the wall just below the 
	porthole, with Jason's hideous mask framed in the 
	circular shattered window. She's slowly dying.

	CLOSE ON RENNIE'S HAND

	Her movements slow as the oxygen leaves her system. But 
	Rennie's fingers miraculously find a recognizable object: 
	the ink-dip pen given to her by Miss Van Deusen. She 
	seizes it, getting a firm grip.

	CLOSE ON JASON

	as Rennie JABS THE PEN BACKWARDS, SENDING THE SHARP 
	INSTRUMENT THROUGH THE EYEHOLE OF HIS MASK. Jason 
	instantly releases her, reeling backwards.

	RENNIE

	sinks to the floor, scrambling on all fours to get as far 
	away from the porthole as possible. She makes it across 
	the room to her stateroom door just as:

	THE DOOR

	is SLAMMED OPEN FROM THE OTHER SIDE. She shrieks in 
	terror but it's SEAN who is standing there.

				SEAN
		Rennie...??

				RENNIE
			(pointing)
		The window...

	Sean rushes to the shattered porthole, looking out, 
	seeing nothing. He steps back to her.

				RENNIE
		I don't understand what is happening 
		to me...

	She breaks down; he holds her.

				SEAN
		It's gonna be okay...

	INT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT (EFX)

	...but Sean couldn't be more wrong. The flames are 
	lapping at the fuel pump and hoses, furiously burning 
	down into the tank. A second later the whole thing 
	EXPLODES IN A BALL OF FIRE.

	EXT. SHIP HULL - UNDERWATER (EFX/MODEL?)

	as a huge HOLE is blown through the thick steel hull:

	INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME

	The ship noticeably rocks from the explosion. Rennie 
	clings to him fearfully.

				RENNIE
		What is it??

	One second later, the lights begin to flicker.

				SEAN  
		The power room...

	INT. POWER ROOM - SAME TIME (EFX)

	as huge amounts of water rush in from a gaping hole in 
	the hull.

	INT. SHIP KITCHEN - SAME TIME

	as the overhead lights flicker over McCulloch. There's 
	some fear mixed with the anger as he grips his flare gun, 
	moving onward.

	PONT OF VIEW FROM KITCHEN OVENS

	Someone is crouched behind a massive convection oven, 
	spying on McCulloch.

	MCCULLOCH

	almost flinches when the lights die and he's plunged 
	into blackness. He moves forward, every step tentative. 
	He passes the convection ovens and we REMAIN on them, 
	spotting the frightened face of the DECK HAND in the 
	shadows. The deranged old man is very sober now, 
	clutching a LARGE KITCHEN KNIFE for defense.

	INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME

	Sean paces feverishly in the blackness of her room, 
	trying to think, talking to himself.

				SEAN
		Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, 
		assess the damage and act 
		accordingly...

				RENNIE
		Is the ship going to sink??

	He returns to Rennie, the panic settling back in.

				SEAN
		I don't know.

	Her ultimate fear is staring her straight in the face. 
	Suddenly the dim blue lights flicker on.

				SEAN
		The emergency lights just kicked in...

	Sean makes Rennie look into his eyes. His words are meant 
	to convince himself as much as Rennie.

				SEAN
		We'll be okay. I want you to wait by 
		the lifeboats, just in case.

				RENNIE
			(terrified)
		I'm not going near any lifeboat!

				SEAN
		But Rennie...

				RENNIE
		I'm not!!

	INT. SHIP RESTAURANT ROOM - SAME TIME

	as Miss Van Deusen gathers a handful of students who are 
	panicking, sitting them down.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Everybody wait right here until I come 
		back with the others -- understand?

	They nod, frightened to death. She dashes away, carrying 
	us into a view of the dining room windows. No one 
	notices the SILHOUETTE OF JASON passing by on the outside 
	desk.

	INT. ENGINE ROOM - SAME TIME (EFX)

	Sea water is pouring into the ship's motors. Clouds of 
	steam and black smoke fill the room as the engine 
	bearings begin to GRIND.

	INT. SHIP HALLWAY - SAME TIME

	as McCulloch rushes up to Rennie's already open door, 
	cautiously entering with flare gun raised.

				MCCULLOCH
		Rennie??

	MCCULLOCH'S POINT OF VIEW

	The room is empty, shards of the porthole glass scattered 
	across her rug. He steps over to it, bringing his head up 
	to the gaping hole, peering outside. We wait for his 
	attack...but it doesn't come. McCulloch's eyes take us to 
	something across the room. The bathroom door is afar.

	MCCULLOCH

	cautiously steps up to the door, silently grabbing the 
	knob and SWINGING IT OPEN. It's empty. He hears 
	something, spinning around. Again, nothing is there. 
	McCulloch quickly moves to the telephone and dials. A few 
	seconds pass.

				MCCULLOCH
		Come on, answer!!

	INT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME

	TIGHT on the bridge telephone, ringing repeatedly. RISE 
	TO FIND JASON, ignoring the phone, scrutinizing the deck 
	below through rain-streaked windows.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	Miss Van Deusen is darting across the deck, gathering up 
	a trio of terrified seniors.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	Jason methodically moves to the bank of switches, 
	studying them.

	INSERT - CONSOLE

	In large, unmistakable letters over a red button are the 
	words "ABANDON SHIP ALARM." He flips back the plastic 
	safety cover, exposing the button.

	INT. BOWELS OF SHIP - SAME TIME  

	A horrible grinding sound echoes through the narrow 
	corridor. Sean and Rennie appear at the opposite end, 
	coughing on the black smoke which clouds their 
	passageway. Sean looks down, seeing that they are 
	standing in a puddle of water.

				SEAN
		Water has gotten to the engines.
			(coughs)
		We have to get everybody off this 
		ship...

	INSERT - ABANDON SHIP BUTTON

	as Jason presses it with firm deliberation, and:

	INT. BOWELS OF SHIP - CONTINUOUS

	A WHOOPING SIREN blasts through the passageway. Sean and 
	Rennie have no time to react because:

	ANGLE - CORRIDOR (EFX)

	A sealed compartment door EXPLODES OPEN WITH THE PRESSURE 
	OF SEA WATER...

	REVERSE ANGLE (EFX)

	...and a WALL OF WATER ENGULFS.RENNIE AND SEAN, KNOCKING 
	THEM DOWN. Sean fights to pull her up, but not in time 
	for her to witness:

	WAYNE'S CHARRED CORPSE (EFX)

	which bobs up in front of her. Rennie cries out, 
	scrambling to grab onto Sean as what's left of Wayne's 
	body washes past them.

	EXT. DECK - NIGHT

	as a door opens and Miss Van Deusen guides a half-dozen 
	SENIORS over to the LIFEBOAT STATIONS.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
			(shouting over storm)
		Everybody climb in!

	They follow her orders as the Abandon Ship alarm wretches 
	on. But little do they know that:

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	Someone is briskly moving towards the group and Miss Van 
	Deusen. Just as we are within a few feet of her... 

	REVERSE ANGLE

	--It's MCCULLOCH who's approached them. He grabs Miss Van 
	Deusen, shaking her violently.

				MCCULLOCH
		What did you do with Rennie??

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Nothing! I went to her cabin and...

	McCulloch rushes off before she can finish. Miss Van 
	Deusen turns back to the other kids, helping them into 
	the boat.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Everybody hurry...please...

	EXT. DECK - CLOSE ON MAHOGANY DECKING - SAME TIME

	We slowly DOLLY BACKWARDS until Miles' AXE comes into 
	frame, still stuck in the mahogany decking. A beat, then 
	JASON'S HALAL DISLODGES IT FROM THE WOOD.

	INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	as Sean climbs up from below, soaked to the bone, pulling 
	up a half-conscious Rennie. Sean carries her around a 
	corner, where he collides with McCulloch. McCulloch 
	pulls Rennie away from him.

				MCCULLOCH
		She never should've set foot on this 
		ship. This is your fault!

				SEAN
		This is Jason's fault!

				MCCULLOCH
			(shouting)
		Not another word, do you hear me??

	EXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - NIGHT

	as Miss Van Deusen throws the "down" lever and the 
	lifeboat hoist begins to lower the boat. Camera SLOWLY 
	CREEPS IN A SEMI-CIRCLE AS A SILHOUETTED FIGURE STEPS 
	INTO A POOL OF LIGHT BEHIND HER. JASON.

	ANGLE - LIFEBOAT  

	One of the students screams, the others clinging together 
	upon the sight of this infamous monster. But the boat is 
	already over the edge, past the point of return. And 
	lowering at a snail's pace.

	MISS VAN DEUSEN

	turns to see JASON APPROACHING THEM WITH AXE RAISED. She 
	backs away but Jason ignores her, heading directly for 
	the hoist. He arches back with his weapon and SLICES 
	DOWNWARD.

	INSERT - HOIST CABLE (SECOND UNIT)

	as Jason's axe CHOPS THE CABLE IN TWO, and:

	EXT. SHIP/OCEAN (TANK)

	The bow cable SNAPS, DUMPING THE HALF DOZEN TEENAGERS 
	INTO THE TURBULENT SALT WATER. They last about five 
	seconds before succumbing to a drowning death.

	MISS VAN DEUSEN

	sees it all, her intestines constricting in agonizing 
	knots. She summons all her rationale and sends it down to 
	her legs, running away as fast as she can.

	MISS VAN DEUSEN'S POINT OF VIEW

	--knocking down deck tables, chairs and chaise lounges as 
	she flees. The creative writing teacher swerves around a 
	column, heading for an interior door, sliding to a stop 
	as it BANGS OPEN IN FRONT OF HER. McCulloch steps 
	outside, carrying Rennie, with Sean right behind her. 
	Rennie is conscious now, squirming free of her uncle upon 
	the sight of Miss Van Deusen.

	ANGLE TO INCLUDE ALL

	as Rennie rushes into Miss Van Deusen's arms. The teacher 
	holds her, beginning to cry herself.

				MCCULLOCH
		Why aren't you with the others, 
		woman??

	Finally the message comes forth:

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Jason...he has an axe...

	His face grows taut with anger.

				MCCULLOCH
		Jason Voorhees is dead!!

	A PRIMAL SCREAM OF AGONY immediately cries out behind 
	them, the words unintelligible. They turn around to 
	witness THE DECK HANG STAGGERING TOWARDS THEM, GRIPPING 
	THE KITCHEN KNIFE. 

	MCCULLOCH

	raises the flare gun with zero hesitation and FIRES IT...

	ANGLE - DECK HAND (EFX)

	...and the charge EXPLODES INTO HIS CHEST. He stands 
	there with his chest smoldering, almost like a gargoyle 
	in effigy. A second later the poor old man falls forward, 
	and:

	CLOSE ON HIS BACK (EFX)

	They all see that JASON'S AXE HAS BEEN BURIED IN HIS 
	BACK.

	RETURN TO MASTER

	McCulloch gazes with utter disbelief.

				MCCULLOCH
		Dear Christ...

				SEAN
		We have to get off this ship!!

	They back away from the horrid sight and begin to run, 
	the Abandon Ship alarm still attacking their ears.

	EXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - NIGHT

	as McCulloch, Miss Van Deusen, Rennie and Sean scramble 
	to the closest lifeboat.

				SEAN
		Everybody in -- I'll get the hoists

	McCulloch has no time for politeness, moving to the 
	lifeboat ahead of the women. Rennie stops cold, gazing 
	classy-eyed at the small boat.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Come on, sweetheart -- get in...

	But she doesn't budge. McCulloch levels wild eyes on her, 
	quickly climbing back down.

				MCCULLOCH
		Get in the boat, Rennie!

				RENNIE
		I...I can't...

				MCCULLOCH
			(shaking her)
		You can and you will!!

	He tries to slap her out of it, dragging her over to the 
	boat, ignoring her terror-stricken frenzy.

				SEAN
		Stop it!!

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Leave her alone, Charles!

	Miss Van Deusen quickly moves to a hysterical Rennie and 
	holds her, eyeing McCulloch vehemently.

	EXT. DECK - TIGHT ON DEAD DECK HAND - SAME TIME

	as rain begins to wash the blood from his back. JASON'S 
	FOOT TRUDGES INTO FRAME...then his HAND REACHES DOWN, 
	RETRIEVING HIS AXE FROM THE DECK HAND'S SPINE.

	EXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - SAME TIME

	as Rennie clings to	 Miss Van Deusen, crying.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		It's the only way, Rennie. Let's get 
		in the boat now, okay? Please...for 
		me?

	Rennie finds herself nodding. Miss Van Deusen helps the 
	trembling girl up the steps, an angered McCulloch right 
	behind.

	INT. LIFEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

	as Rennie climbs over the boat edge, RECOILING AT THE 
	SOUND OF A SNARLING DOG. Toby is curled up in the 
	corner of the lifeboat, teeth bared.

				RENNIE
		Toby...

	She climbs in, moving to her equally, relieved dog, 
	McCulloch and Miss Van Deusen right behind her.

	INSERT - HOIST BUTTON (SECOND UNIT)

	as Sean jabs it and the hoist motor kicks in.

	EXT. SHIP - WIDE SHOT (EFX)

	just as a huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING cracks over the smoke 
	stack and upper deck. JASON steps out from behind it, 
	gaping down on them with frightening omnipresence. 
	Gripping the bloody axe.

	EXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - CONTINUOUS

	Sean climbs in the boat as it continues to lower. He 
	takes one look back at the ship and sees:

	JASON

	rapidly moving down the staircase towards them. Sean's 
	view is CUT OFF as the lifeboat sinks below deck level.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	as Sean's eyes dart around, down to the sea, up at the 
	hoist.

				SEAN
		Come on...faster....

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	trampling towards the hoist, about thirty feet away now. 
	The boat has already disappeared over the edge.

	EXT. SHIP/STORMY SEA - NIGHT (TANK)

	as the lifeboat continues to lower, about ten feet from 
	making contact with the tumultuous ocean. The ship's hull 
	is crooked and sinking.

	TRACKING WITH JASON

	as he relentlessly moves to the hoist cable, raising his 
	axe.

	EXT. SHIP/STORMY SEA (TANK)

	as the ship finally touches water, and:

	INSERT - HOIST CABLE (SECOND UNIT

	Jason's axe blade CHOPS THE CABLE...

	EXT. SHIP/STORMY SEA (TANK)

	...and the hoist cable falls limply over them. Jason's 
	too late. Sean looks up and sees:

	JASON

	standing by the hoist, hovering over the edge. Very 
	angry.

	SEAN (TANK)

	grabs an oar, turning back to McCulloch.

				SEAN
		Start rowing!!

	McCulloch takes the oar as Miss Van Deusen holds onto 
	Rennie tightly, the girl's eyes squeezed shut. Sean looks 
	up at the ship again, and:

	SEAN'S POINT OF VIEW

	Jason is none.

	EXT. SHIP/STORMY SEA (TANK)

	Sean looks around with confusion as huge waves, wind and 
	rain pummel them.

				SEAN
		He's gone...

	POINT OF VIEW FROM WATER (TANK)

	...or is he? We're moving towards the lifeboat at water 
	level, almost like a shark preparing for attack.

	INT. LIFEBOAT (TANK)

	Sean breathes with some relief, resuming his rowing with 
	McCulloch. They get about three strokes apiece before:

	A DARK FIGURE (TANK)

	lunges from under the ocean surface, grabbing onto 
	Sean. Everybody SCREAMS...but it's JULIUS, gasping for 
	oxygen, spitting up seawater. Sean pulls him over the 
	edge.

				SEAN
		It's Julius!

	Miss Van Deusen moves to help him and we:

								 SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. STORMY OCEAN - WIDE SHOT - DAY (SECOND UNIT)

	The ship is gone now, the lifeboat a speck in the ocean.

	INT. LIFEBOAT - DAY (OCEAN?)

	The water is less rough now, the rain replaced with fog. 
	Julius has taken McCulloch's place behind an oar; 
	McCulloch is flanking his shivering niece with Miss Van 
	Deusen.

				MCCULLOCH
			(miserable)
		If we don't find the shore soon we're 
		all going to die.

	Sean tries to ignore him, keeping his mind on rowing.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
			(unable to hide fear)
		Do you know where we are, Sean?

	Sean pauses, utterly exhausted. He thinks for a moment, 
	remembering his father's gift. Sean reaches into his coat 
	pocket, removing the pocket navigational calculator. He 
	stares at it long and hard. Julius looks over at him, 
	seeing that Sean is on the verge of tears. He grips his 
	shoulder.

				JULIUS
		Hey man, if I can make it, so can. 
		you.

	Sean slowly nods, turning on the calculator.

								  SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (TANK)

	as the lifeboat rows into frame, the water relatively 
	calm.

	INT. LIFEBOAT - NIGHT (TANK)

	McCulloch, Rennie and Miss Van Deusen are asleep, Sean 
	and Julius rowing on sheer will power. Sean takes one 
	more stroke, feels himself passing out, then regains his 
	coherence again. Julius glances off the side of the ship 
	for no particular reason, then does a doubletake.

	JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW (SECOND UNIT - N.Y.)

	They are rowing right past THE STATUE OF LIBERTY, 
	illuminated in all its glory.

	INT. LIFEBOAT (TANK)

	Julius feels his eyes widening and a huge smile taking 
	control of his haggard face. He tugs on Sean's sleeve, 
	his eyes never leaving the monument.

				JULIUS
		Hey man, wake up! Check it out!!

	The other stir as well, opening their eyes, not sure if 
	it's some kind of vision or if they are genuinely here.

				JULIUS
		God damn, we're in New York! You did 
		it, my man!!

	Julius howls with delight, Miss Van Deusen hugging Rennie 
	as Julius gives Sean the high-five. Toby barks.

	WIDE SHOT - NEW YORK HARBOR - NIGHT (SECOND UNIT - N.Y.)

	as the lifeboat rows toward the very famous skyline of 
	Manhattan, twinkling in the near distance. We can hear 
	the faint sound of Julius singing "New York, New York," 
	relieved to be alive. They're going to make it.

	EXT. EMPTY OCEAN - ANOTHER ANGLE (TANK)

	as the sound of Julius' voice grows fainter. The water 
	begins to ripple...then the top half of a HOCKEY MASK 
	BREAKS THE SURFACE FOR A BREATH OF AIR, SINKING AGAIN. 
	And swimming onward.

	EXT. CANNERY HARBOR - NIGHT

	as Julius and Sean row the lifeboat up to a narrow barge 
	beneath deserted dock warehouses. They are not in the 
	safest part of town by a longshot.

	CLOSER ANGLE

	as they climb onto the barge. Rennie breathes with relief 
	as she steps off the boat. She takes a final glance back 
	at it and sees:

	YOUNG RENNIE

	flailing her arms in the water right next to the 
	lifeboat, drowning.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		Hhhhelp...me....

	Suddenly a DECOMPOSED HAND REACHES UP FROM BELOW, 
	GRABBING HER, DRAGGING HER UNDER.

	EXT. BARGE - ON RENNIE

	She gazes in utter shock, screaming:

				RENNIE
		No!!!

	They all follow her eyeline...but the water is calm, 
	nothing there.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
			(holding her)
		It's okay...you're safe now...

	McCulloch grits his teeth.

				MCCULLOCH
		Come on -- everybody up the ladder.

	He's the first one up. Sean looks at Rennie, concerned, 
	then hoists Toby up in his arms. They all begin climbing 
	the ladder.

	CLOSE ON LADDER - NIGHT

	as the last pair of feet disappear over the top edge of 
	the dock. Camera PANS back down the rungs, finding the 
	lifeboat and barge again. Suddenly JASON SPRINGS FROM THE 
	WATER, CLIMBING ONTO THE BARGE. He gazes up at his new 
	surroundings, quite different from all the years he's 
	spent at Crystal Lake. But an item at the far end of the 
	dock causes him the longest pause...

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	A tattered billboard over one of the warehouses 
	advertises the NEW YORK RANGERS HOCKEY TEAM, featuring a 
	full shot of the HOCKEY-MASKED GOALIE.

	JASON

	looks at it long and hard. He tears off his life 
	preserver wits renewed ambition.

	WIDE SHOT - BARGE AND DOCK WAREHOUSES - NIGHT

	as Jason heads up the ladder. He's about to take 
	Manhattan.

	EXT. CANNERY WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT  

	as our survivors head into an isolated, foreboding group 
	of dock warehouses and alleys.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		There must be a phone around here 
		somewhere.

				MCCULLOCH
		A wonderful choice of places to dock a 
		boat, Mr. Robertson.

	Sean looks away, trying to keep from losing his temper.

	PREDATOR'S POINT OF VIEW - SAME TIME

	We're spying on them from behind a stack of crates as 
	they come in our direction. Waiting for the right moment.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	as they move towards the stack of crates. Without 
	warning, a PAIR OF GANG BANGERS JUMP OUT, BOTH HOLDING 
	GUNS. Nervous young druggies.

				GANG RANGER #1
		Hands up!!

				GANG BANGER #2  
		Do it!!

	All hands go up. Gang Banger #2 grabs McCulloch's watch 
	and wallet, skimming through a wad of bills and credit 
	cards while #1 keeps them covered.

				GANG BANGER #2
		Got some good shit here, holmes.

				GANG BANGER #1
			(eyeing Rennie)
		You got that right...

	He steps over to Rennie, brushing her hair back with the 
	barrel of his revolver, spotting the Statue of Liberty 
	pendant Sean gave her.

				GANG BANGER #L
		Now ain't that sweet.

	He tears it off her neck, pocketing it. Sean angrily 
	moves toward him and Gang Banger #l shoves the barrel 
	against Rennie's temple.

				GANG BANGER #1
		Go ahead, superman. Be a hero.

	Sean has no choice but to freeze. Julius flexes his 
	fists, but he too has Gang Banger #2's gun leveled on 
	him. McCulloch stares at the thugs with obvious contempt. 
	It doesn't go unnoticed.

				GANG BANGER #L
		You got a problem, Dad?

	McCulloch offers some rare silence, shaking a "no" to the 
	gun-toting kid. Rennie's dog-begins to growl, backing 
	away, ready to defend her. Gang Banger #1 points his 
	barrel at Toby with zero conscience, cocking back the 
	hammer.

				RENNIE
		No!

	She pushes his arm to the side just as the bullet 
	FIRES...

	ANGLE - TOBY

	as the bullet tears up asphalt next to the dog's paws. 
	Toby sprints off into the darkness.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	Gang Banger #1 grabs Rennie by the hair, brutally jerking 
	her head back.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Please, don't hurt her...

				GANG BANGER #L
		Hurt this princess?
			(beat)
		Would I do that?

	They cough out laughs. Gang Banger #1 looks into Rennie's 
	eyes, his barrel still on her skin.

				GANG BANGER #1
		You look like a party girl, princess. 
		How'd you like to go on a date with me 
		and my friend? If you're free, that 
		is.

	More phlegm-filled laughs. He drags her away, Gang Banger 
	#2 backing away with him with his gun still trained on 
	the others.

				GANG BANGER #2
		You follow and we'll blow her fuckin' 
		head off, comprende?

	The others watch helplessly as Rennie is abducted.

				JULIUS
		We can't let those gang-bangers get 
		away, man...

	Julius starts to move after them. McCulloch grabs him.

				MCCULLOCH
		You heard him! We have to call the 
		police

	Julius jerks away from McCulloch's grasp. But he knows 
	McCulloch	is right.

				MCCULLOCH
		Everyone split up -- we'll cover more 
		ground that way.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		I don't think that's such a safe idea

				MCCULLOCH
		My niece's life hangs in the balance 
		right now!! Every second counts.

	No more rebuttal. They hurry off.

	EXT. GANG BANGER'S LAIR - NIGHT

	It's a narrow passageway between warehouses...decrepit 
	brownstones with shattered chicken-wire windows, moss 
	growing on the bricks. The Gang Bangers appear with 
	Rennie, dragging her down some concrete steps.

				GANG BANGER #L
		Welcome to the casbah, princess.

	PAN AROUND with them as they walk through a thick blanket 
	of STEAM which pours out of a factory vent. We MOVE 
	through the mist with them, revealing a tattered, rain-
	soaked couch and chair, upholstery shredded. A spool once 
	used for telephone wire functions as their coffee table. 
	They splash through puddles, throwing her down on the 
	couch.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	--looking back at the steam vent. JASON APPEARS IN THE 
	BILLOWING MIST.

	CLOSE UP - SYRINGE

	as a yellowish liquid squirts out the dirty needle. WIDEN 
	to find Gang Banger #2 holding it with transfixed eyes, 
	his compadre holding a squirming Rennie down on the 
	couch, tearing back her jacket to reveal a bare arm.

				RENNIE
		Please don't...

				GANG BANGER #1
		Loosen up, baby. It'll feel way
		better if you're stoned.

	CLOSE ON JASON'S FEET - SAME TIME

	Amongst the slime and cigarette butts is a discarded 
	syringe. Jason picks it up.

	CLOSER ANGLE - COUCH

	just as Gang Banger #2 jabs Rennie with the needle. 
	Gang Banger #1 wrestles off his torn leather jacket, 
	pushing Rennie back on the exposed foam padding as his 
	friend watches excitedly.

				GANG BANGER #1
		Slang us some more 'caine, JoJo. We're 
		in for a long night.

	Gang Banger #2 runs out the back way. #1 tears open 
	Rennie's blouse, his filthy mouth moving to her neck. 
	Rennie spits in his face. He hesitates not in SLAPPING 
	HER HARD.

				GANG BANGER #1
		It's your parade, princess. Can be 
		smooth or can be rough. Your choice.

	She closes .her eyes, trying to blot out what's about to 
	happen.

				GANG BANGER #1
		I think I'm in love.

	PUSH IN on his face as his neck arches down, bringing his 
	lips toward her chest. Just before contact he GRUNTS 
	THICKLY, HIS EYES BUGGING OUT.

	WIDER ANGLE

	Jason is standing right behind him, shoving something 
	into his back, out of frame. He thrusts it again, 
	bringing with it one more horrific grunt from the kid. 
	Jason goes for number three and: 

	CLOSE UP - GANG BANGER #1'S CHEST (EFX)

	Jason's syringe gets shoved completely through him, the 
	needle sticking out his front side.

	RENNIE

	opens her eyes, looking into the dead boy's face as 
	blood drips from his mouth. He collapses in front of 
	her, giving way to a view of JASON TOWERING OVER HER. At 
	the same time:

	GANG BANGER #2

	comes around the corner.

				GANG BANGER #2
		Forgot my money, holmes...

	Ha stops dead in his tracks at the sight of Jason.

				GANG BANGER #2
		Who the fuck are you?

	Jason paces toward him. The kid glances at his dead 
	friend arched over the couch, quickly whipping out his 
	.38.

				GANG BANGER #2
		You're dead, fuckhead.

	BANG!

	...but Jason keeps on coming. Five shots later and 
	Jason's still standing, easily picking up the slime ball 
	and SHOVING HIM HEAD FIRST INTO THE MOSSY BRICK WALL. The 
	kid falls in a bloody heap.

	RENNIE

	shoves Gang Banger #1 off of her as Jason returns his 
	attention to her. She grabs a loose brick and FLINGS IT 
	AT HIM, CRACKING HIS HOCKEY MASK, momentarily 
	disorienting him. Rennie sprints away.

	EXT. ALLEY #1 - NIGHT (LONG LENS)

	as Julius runs into view, looking down a menacing alley, 
	spotting a phone booth. He hurries for it.

	PREDATOR'S POINT OF VIEW

	Like a cat watching a bird, we watch Julius head for the 
	booth.

	JULIUS

	slams open the booth door, grabbing the receiver, 
	punching the "operator" digit. SLOWLY PUSH IN on him as 
	he waits for an answer. Several more rings.

				JULIUS
		C'mon...

	Finally a click and muffled words from the operator.

				JULIUS
		Get me the police -- this is an 
		emergency...

				

	SMASH! as JASON'S FIST CRASHES THROUGH THE BOOTH WINDOW, 
	GRABBING JULIUS BY THE THROAT. Julius grips Jason's scaly 
	arm with all his strength, staring at the cracked hockey 
	mask framed in the shattered window. Julius summons all 
	his strength, tearing free of Jason's grasp and running 
	out the door. The phone is left dangling.

	RUNNING WITH JULIUS (HAND HELD)

	with no apparent direction. Literally running for his 
	life.

	TRACKING WITH JASON

	He's just as quick, but smoother and more methodical.

	JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW (HAND HELD)

	heading up the alley, spotting a fire escape, diverting 
	his course straight for it.

	ANGLE - FIRE ESCAPE

	as Julius LEAPS ONTO IT, dragging himself up, climbing as 
	fast as is humanly possible.

	ANGLE - JASON

	...but Jason is-far from human, easily negotiating the 
	wrought-iron stairs and rapidly catching up.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

	as Julius' head appears, clawing his way onto the tar-
	papered surface, running to the opposite side. A second 
	later, JASON HOPS UP RIGHT BEHIND HIM.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	as Julius soon learns the awful truth that the only way 
	up is the only way down...with the exception of a head-
	splitting freefall. No way is he gonna jump. Julius turns 
	back to Jason, raising his fists, psyching himself up for 
	the fight of his life. He whispers to himself:

				JULIUS
		Use the combos and keep the feet 
		light...

	THE FIGHT BEGINS, man against monster, each sizing the 
	other up. 
	Jason takes the first swing, Julius deftly dodging him 
	and countering with left-right-left combination. They 
	have absolutely no effect. Julius follows up with a round 
	of kidney punches. Again, nothing. Julius finds himself 
	being forced back against the rings, which in this case 
	is the edge of the roof. He risks a glance backwards and 
	sees:

	JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW

	It's a long, rough way down. It's do or die time.

	RETURN TO SCENE

	as Julius SLAMS PUNCH AFTER PUNCH INTO JASON, forcing him 
	back to the center of the rooftop, spending every last 
	ounce of his energy in doing so. He throws one more 
	feeble punch, knowing it's his last.

				JULIUS
		Take your best shot, motherfucker...

	Jason gladly obliges, winding up and recoiling with a 
	punch none of us expected...

	JULIUS' HEAD (EFX)

	gets literally knocked off his shoulders, cascading off 
	the edge of the rooftop, and:

	ANGLE - SLANTED LOWER ROOF

	--the decapitated head lands on a sloped roof below, 
	rolling down towards street level and falling into a 
	garbage-filled dumpster.

	EXT. ALLEY #2 - NIGHT  

	as Rennie dizzily runs down the alley, the effects of the 
	drugs kicking in.

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)

	Blurry, disoriented, erratic. Suddenly A FIGURE JUMPS OUT 
	FROM A CORRIDOR IN FRONT OF HER.

	RETURN TO SHOT

	It's SEAN. He rushes to her, sensing her disorientation.

				SEAN
		Rennie...what'd they do to you??

				RENNIE
		Drugs...
			(serious pause)
		Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.

	Oh Jesus. He never expected this.

				SEAN
		We have to find the others.

	Together they run off.

	EXT. ALLEY #3 - NIGHT (OVERHEAD ANGLE)

	as Miss Van Deusen briskly walks below us, far from 
	relaxed in this threatening environment.

	TRACKING SHOT

	She moves forward, the only sound being her shoes against 
	wet asphalt. Four more steps, then a DARK, OUT OF FOCUS 
	FIGURE STEPS OUT BEHIND HER WITH A GUN.

				VOICE
		Freeze.

	RACK FOCUS to find a uniformed IRISH COP standing there, 
	service revolver raised. McCulloch steps out from the 
	alcove as well, recognizing Miss Van Deusen.

				MCCULLOCH
		It's okay -- she's with me.

	She turns around, lowering her hands, utterly relieved.

				IRISH COP
		My apologies, Miss. My unit's right 
		over here.

	They head through an ABANDONED PARKING LOT towards a 
	concrete wall with stairs; about six feet above the wall 
	is an upper street, where his patrol car is parked. They 
	get halfway through the lot when they hear:

				SEAN (O.S.)
		Hey!

	REVERSE ANGLE

	as Sean and Rennie run to join them from the alley. 
	McCulloch rushes to his niece.

				MCCULLOCH
		Rennie, thank God...

	But Rennie goes to Miss Van Deusen instead. It's a bitter 
	pill for McCulloch.

				SEAN
		Jason's here in New York.

				MCCULLOCH
		Don't be ridiculous!

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		Is it true, Rennie??

	She nods, unable to repress her fear.

				IRISH COP
		Is this the lass in question?

				MCCULLOCH
			(stewing)
		Yes.

				IRISH COP
		Who is...Jason?

				MCCULLOCH
		He's a walking corpse, a phantasm from 
		hell.

	The others stare at McCulloch angrily. Miss Van Deusen 
	turns to the confused policeman.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
		I'm afraid you'll have some trouble 
		believing us.

				IRISH COP
		So try me.

	EXT. SQUAD CAR - NIGHT

	parked above the abandoned garage, the interior dark. The 
	Cop and our heroes appear in the background, coming 
	towards it.

				IRISH COP
		You're right -- I find it a tall tale 
		indeed. 
		But you seem like honest folks so I'm 
		inclined to believe at least some of 
		it.

				MISS VAN DEUSEN
			(relieved)
		Thank you. The first thing we' have to 
		do is find Julius.

				IRISH COP
		I'm sure he'll pop up soon enough. Why 
		don't you climb in the back while I 
		radio for backup.

	ADJUST INTO A FULL SHOT OF THE BACK DOOR AS HE SWINGS IT 
	OPEN...but even in this darkness, we see that it's 
	empty. They climb in. The Cop opens his drivers door, 
	and...

	INSERT - DOME LIGHT (SECOND UNIT)

	The car dome light blinks on, and...

	ANGLE - BACK SEAT

	Our four survivors' faces are brightly illuminated, 
	INSTANTLY CHANGING TO GASPS AND SCREAMS because:

	THEIR POINT OF VIEW (EFX)

	Julius' severed head is resting on the dash board, 
	staring back at them!!!

	ANGLE - COP

	reacting to their terror, seeing Julius' head, quickly 
	grabbing the radio mike. But he has no time for a message 
	because JASON REACHES UP FROM THE PARKING LOT PIT BELOW, 
	GRABBING THE COP'S ANKLE, DRAGGING HIM DOWN. The radio is 
	still in his grasp.

	INSERT - DISPATCH RADIO (SECOND UNIT)

	as the radio cord grows taut, finally snapping. The 
	Irish cop's awful yell echoes over it, silencing after a 
	sick THUD.

	INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

	The foursome instantly try to flee the car, but police 
	cars have no door handles in the back.

				SEAN
		There aren't any handles!!

	Cocaine flowing through her veins, Rennie acts 
	hyperkinetically, scratching her way over the seats just 
	as:

	JASON

	appears at the parking lot stairs, STALKING STRAIGHT 
	TOWARDS THE CAR.

	INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

	There is no time for escape. Rennie finds the ignition 
	and fires it up, jamming it into drive and STOMPING ON 
	THE ACCELERATOR. Julius' head rolls off the dash, onto 
	the floorboards.

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)

	Her vision is still a stoned one but clear enough to set 
	her target. We come straight at the abominable creature 
	and:

	WHAM! (EFX)

	Jason is mowed down.

	RENNIE

	slams on the brakes, jerks it into reverse and FLOORS IT 
	AGAIN.

	CLOSE ON JASON (EFX)

	as the automobile grinds back over him a second time.

	RENNIE

	stomps on the brake pedal and the tires SCREECH TO A 
	HALT. They all take a moment to catch their breath, 
	looking out the front window...

	THEIR POINT OF VIEW

	Jason lies dead on the asphalt. For about two seconds. He 
	SLOWLY STANDS.

	RENNIE

	desperately throws it into forward again, gripping the 
	wheel and RACING FORWARD.

	POINT OF VIEW FROM FRONT BUMPER (STUNT DRIVE)

	Jason's standing there for one second, but the next 
	moment he is LEAPING OUT OF THE WAY...

	EXT. ABANDONED PARKING LOT (STUNT DRIVE)

	...and the squad car SMASHES THROUGH A CHAIN LINK FENCE, 
	FREEFALLING TO THE ABANDONED PARKING LOT BELOW.

	EXT. ALLEY #3 - CONTINUOUS (STUNT DRIVE)

	as the car bottoms out, then swerves into a sharp right 
	turn, racing down the alley.

	POINT OF VIEW FROM FRONT BUMPER (STUNT DRIVE)

	as Jason appears at the end of the alley, blocking their 
	retreat.

	INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

	as Rennie stomps the brake pedal, jerking it into 
	reverse...

	EXT. ALLEY #3 - CONTINUOUS (STUNT DRIVE)

	as she backs up, changes gears and races down an 
	intersecting alley.

	POINT OF VIEW FROM FRONT BUMPER (STUNT DRIVE)

	speeding towards an escape when JASON POPS OUT AGAIN! 
	He's everywhere all at once...

	INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

	slamming on the discs one more time, flooring it into 
	reverse.

	CLOSE ON TIRES - CONTINUOUS (SECOND UNIT)

	as the squad car's rear tires smoke and spin, finally 
	gripping pavement.

	POINT OF VIEW OUT REAR WINDOW (STUNT DRIVE)

	as we fly backwards...and JASON APPEARS BEHIND THEM!!

	TIGHT ON REAR VIEW MIRROR

	--Rennie's terrified face filling it, seeing that Jason 
	is in back of them.

	TIGHT ON REAR TIRES (SECOND UNIT)

	as they screech to a halt one final time, rapidly 
	rotating in the opposite direction and speeding out of 
	frame.

	INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

	Rennie is almost maniacal now, her knuckles white around 
	the vinyl wheel, her foot practically mashed through the 
	floorboard.

				MCCULLOCH
		Rennie, for God's sake slow down!!

	She doesn't hear him, or anything for that matter. Her 
	eyes remain straight ahead, never blinking.

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)

	There's a FIGURE standing in the distance. But it looks 
	too small to be Jason. We RUSH TOWARDS IT, CHANGING INTO 
	SLOW MOTION JUST BEFORE IMPACT. The figure is a dripping 
	wet boy with a sinister smile. YOUNG JASON.

	EXT. BRICK WALL - A SPLIT SECOND LATER (EFX)

	as the front of the squad car RAMS THE BRICK WALL HEAD-
	ON, THE HOOD BURSTING INTO FLAMES.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as the front passenger door is shoved open by Sean, who 
	drags out Rennie. McCulloch follows close behind, helping 
	Sean carry her away from the wreckage, over by a row of 
	old oil drums filled with slime and rainwater. Then it 
	suddenly hits Sean...

				SEAN
		Miss Van Deusen...

	He takes two steps back to the car when:

	BOOM! (EFX)	

	The squad car interior is ENGULFED IN A BALL OF FLAMES.

	RENNIE

	opens her dazed eyes, seeing Miss Van Deusen's body 
	charring inside the wreckage. It's incomprehensible. She 
	numbly gets to her feet, stepping towards it. Something 
	makes her hesitate: she peers down at the asphalt...

	EXT. ASPHALT - RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)

	A pool of gasoline has collected, flames dancing across 
	its glassy surface. Suddenly a TINY ROWBOAT DISSOLVES IN, 
	not unlike the lifeboat she was so afraid of. The 
	rowboat glides across the surface of the burning 
	gasoline, TWO PEOPLE RIDING IN IT. The flames and asphalt 
	SLOWLY FADE OUT AND GIVE WAY TO A SERENE LAKE.

	RENNIE'S FLASHBACK - CRYSTAL LAKE - DAY

	Shimmering water, clouds and pine trees reflected in it. 
	The rowboat floats into view. The two occupants are YOUNG 
	RENNIE and MCCULLOCH. She's wearing a bathing suit and an 
	innocent smile. And not an inkling of fear about the 
	water. She stands, letting the sun soak into her.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		What a beautiful day.

				MCCULLOCH
		Perfect for a swim, isn't it?

	She frowns at him, looking away.

				MCCULLOCH
		You've been coming out here every 
		summer for the last three years, young 
		lady, and you still haven't learned 
		how.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		I'll take some lessons this time. I 
		promise.

	She bends over, splashing the water.

				MCCULLOCH
		That's what you said last year. I 
		think the time for your first swimming 
		lesson has just come.

	The splashing stops.

				MCCULLOCH
		You don't want to end up drowning like 
		that Voorhees boy, do you?

	She's instantly tense.

				MCCULLOCH
		He never learned how either and he's 
		still at the bottom of this lake.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		He is not.

				MCCULLOCH
		Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull 
		down anybody who falls in and can't 
		swim.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		You're telling a lie.

				MCCULLOCH
		Am I? Let's find out.

	...And quicker than she's able to react to it, MCCULLOCH 
	PUSHES HER OVERBOARD.

	SPLASH!

	as Rennie's body violently disrupts the calm surface. 
	She immediately begins to flounder. McCulloch calmly 
	leans over the edge.

				MCCULLOCH
		Better swim before Jason drags you 
		down, Rennie. Come on, you can do 
		it...

	...but Rennie thrashes in the water, struggling to keep 
	from sinking under the surface.

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW

	Her uncle's face blurs and clears as water splashes her 
	eyes.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		I...I can't...

				MCCULLOCH
		You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!

	RENNIE

	is too panicked to obey.

				YOUNG RENNIE
		Hhhhelp...me....

	She coughs on some water then disappears...

	UNDERWATER (TANK)

	The world above her ceases to exist, murky lake water 
	taking over. Rennie looks-down, and to her horror...

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (TANK)

	Young Jason is grabbing her ankle and dragging her 
	down. The whole image BURSTS INTO FLAMES and we:

								  DISSOLVE BACK TO:

	EXT. ASPHALT - NIGHT

	as the gasoline continues to burn, the rowboat gone. 
	ADJUST to find RENNIE'S FACE, the flames of the car 
	wreckage flickering over her glassy eyes. She looks up at 
	Miss Van Deusen's body one last time before:

	ANGLE - SQUAD CAR (EFX)

	The auto's fuel tank EXPLODES, SHRAPNEL FLYING 
	EVERYWHERE.

	EXT. ALLEY #4 - CONTINUOUS

	She looks up at her uncle with knowing eyes. Eyes that 
	tell him she's remembered everything.

				RENNIE
		You pushed me...

				MCCULLOCH
			(defensively)
		I was only trying to teach you. But I 
		pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your 
		life.

	Rennie just stares, incredulous.

				SEAN
		You son of a bitch...

	She lets it build until she's ready to explode...then:

				RENNIE
		He was down there!!!

	And Rennie runs off. McCulloch starts to follow but Sean 
	grabs him, shoving him down.

				SEAN
		You keep away from her!

	Sean chases after Rennie. Camera methodically PANS BACK 
	TO MCCULLOCH, crumpled on the ground. A very bitter man. 
	He wipes his hands, getting ready to stand when THE 
	SHADOW FALLS OVER HIM. His skin fades to porcelain white.

				MCCULLOCH
		You...are...NOT POSSIBLE.

	But possible, and actual, he is. A PAIR OF ROTTED ARMS 
	EXTEND DOWN, RIPPING HIM OUT OF FRAME.

	TRACKING WITH JASON

	as the walking corpse lifts a screaming McCulloch over 
	his head, carrying him over to one of the scum-filled OIL 
	DRUMS, SHOVING HIM HEAD-FIRST INTO IT. Jason grips 
	McCulloch's thrashing legs as bubbles rise to the surface 
	of the slime, a pathetic gurgling reverberating out the 
	drum. At last McCulloch's appendages go limp. Jason 
	releases him, moving on.

	EXT. ALLEY #5 - NIGHT

	as Sean runs into view, glancing around, spotting Rennie, 
	crouched against a crumbled brick wall. No tears...only 
	hate. Sean sits down next to her. After several 
	moments...

				RENNIE
		I was at school when they told me. 
		'Rennie, we have some very bad news... 
		your parents have been killed in an 
		auto accident.'

	Sean gently takes her hand, sharing her internal agony.

				RENNIE
		It seems like everybody I care about 
		ends up...

	She can't finish. PUSH IN as Sean kisses her on the 
	forehead, then makes her look into his eyes.

				SEAN
		Not this time.

	He caresses her face; it develops into a tender kiss. 
	Finally she holds him back, letting it out. At the same 
	time:

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	Somebody is creeping at a low angle towards them.

	SEAN AND RENNIE

	are lost in their shared quiet moment...until the 
	GROWLING SOUND becomes audible. They look up, seeing:

	TOBY

	cautiously approaching them. Rennie stands, absolutely 
	relieved.

				RENNIE
		Toby...

	She starts to move towards him and her dog SNARLS 
	VICIOUSLY, CROUCHING BACK IN FEAR.

				RENNIE
		What's wrong, boy?

	Another protective growl, then:

	CRASH!

	as Jason stampedes through a stack of crates and garbage 
	cans behind them.

	SEAN, RENNIE AND TOBY

	abruptly flee down the alley, Jason in mad pursuit.	

	EXT. ALLEY/SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT

	as Rennie, Sean and the dog run straight towards us, 
	Jason swiftly catching up. FAST TRACK WITH THEM over to a 
	deserted, rain-slicked SUBWAY ENTRANCE.

	INT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS (EFX)

	as they bang through the glass doors, sailing past us. 
	Three beats later, JASON APPEARS, not bothering to open 
	the door, STAMPEDING RIGHT THROUGH THE GLASS.

	INT. SUBWAY STATION - ESCALATORS (N.Y.)

	Sean, Rennie and Toby sail down the escalators past a few 
	scattered COMMUTERS. Again, Jason appears, looming tall 
	at the top. He starts down the "up" escalator.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (ICY.)

	as an ELDERLY COUPLE rises toward us. Their reactions 
	grow more bleak the closer we get, finally registering 
	terror as we plow right through them.

	ANGLE - SUBWAY TURNSTILES (ICY.)

	Sean and Rennie hop over a metal turnstile, Toby crawling 
	under it. A TICKET TAKER leans out his window, shouting 
	at them.

				TICKET TAKER
		Hey!

	The teenagers are soon forgotten as JASON SMASHES THROUGH 
	THE TURNSTILE LIKE THE TERMINATOR, TEARING THE ALUMINUM 
	WHEEL RIGHT OFF ITS BASE. The Ticket Taker reacts 
	speechlessly, deciding not to press his luck.

	INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS (N.Y.)

	as Sean and Rennie slide up to the edge of the track pit, 
	SEEING THE LIGHTS OF AN APPROACHING TRAIN which is taking 
	too long to get there.

				SEAN
		Come on...

	...but Jason arrives before the train. Toby barks and 
	snarls, trying to protect them. Jason is unfazed. He 
	treads toward them and:

	DOG TOBY

	leaps onto Jason, sinking his teeth into the monster's 
	throat. Jason wrestles the animal into submission just 
	as:

	THE SUBWAY TRAIN

	streaks into the station. A fraction of time later:

	JASON

	heaves the dog in front of the train.

	RENNIE

	shrieks in horror as Toby disappears inside the pit just 
	as the train roars by.

	ANGLE - ONLOOKERS

	They're New Yorkers, but not callous enough to stomach 
	this, quickly scattering. Even a group of severe 
	SKINHEADS decide they can wait for the next train, 
	quickly heading up the escalators after seeing Jason in 
	action.

	SEAN

	makes Rennie look away, dragging her with him along the 
	platform edge in retreat as Jason returns his attention 
	to them. They reach the end of the platform, having no 
	choice but to board the front car.

	INT. SUBWAY TRAIN (N.Y.)

	as the doors whoosh shut...but Jason PRIES THEM OPEN. The 
	TRAIN ENGINEER glances back from his booth, seeing Jason 
	making the improper entry.

				TRAIN ENGINEER
		Hey pal, you can't do that...

	A second later he's gotten a good look at Jason. It's too 
	late for a retraction as JASON SAVAGELY JAMS HIS HEAD 
	INTO THE TRAIN CONSOLE.

	INSERT - TRAIN CONSOLE

	as the Engineer's arm KNOCKS THE THROTTLE FORWARD...

	EXT. SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUOUS (N.Y.)

	...and the train begins to move, racing into the black 
	tunnel.

	INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT (N.Y.)

	as Rennie and Sean run for their lives, arriving at the 
	end of a car, jamming the separating doors open and 
	entering the next car. Jason follows right behind.

	INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT (N.Y.)

	as the train thunders through the station without 
	stopping, baffling several waiting COMMUTERS.

	INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (N.Y.)

	--seeing Sean and Rennie disappear through another 
	connecting door. We storm our way through it into the 
	next car right after them. A handful of TRAVELERS cower 
	away from us.

	INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.)

	as the train rapidly speeds past us, showing no signs of 
	slowing down.

	INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - FINAL CAR (N.Y.)

	as Sean and Rennie come through another set of separating 
	doors, rushing through... finding they're in the last 
	car. They look back, seeing Jason enter at the opposite 
	end. The monster stalks forward. Sean's eyes dart 
	around. He spots the EMERGENCY STOP CORD. HE LEAPS FOR 
	IT.

	EXT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.)

	...and the train SCREECHES TO A HALT.

	INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - CONTINUOUS (N.Y.)

	The sudden stop throws Jason on his back. Sean throws the 
	rear door open, jumping out with Rennie.

	INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.)

	as Sean and Rennie sprint down the center of the tracks 
	toward the light of the next station, running out of 
	strength.

	INT. TIMES SQUARE STATION - NIGHT (N.Y.)

	as they emerge from the darkness, up to the edge of the 
	pit. Sean boosts Rennie up, starting to climb up himself 
	when:

	JASON

	fires out from the tunnel, grabbing onto Sean's ankle. 
	Rennie screams as Sean is dragged down...but he manages 
	to latch onto a chain securing a garbage receptacle. 
	Jason pulls harder, stretching Sean to his limit as 
	Rennie watches helplessly.

				RENNIE
		NO!!!

	RENNIE

	runs straight towards the track pit like a football 
	punter, RECOILING WITH HER RIGHT LEG, KICKING JASON 
	SQUARELY IN THE FACE.

	JASON (EFX)

	trips backwards and LANDS ON THE THIRD, ELECTRIFIED RAIL, 
	RECEIVING TEN THOUSAND VOLTS. His body smokes and 
	convulses, finally sizzling out. He appears to be 
	terminated!!!

	ANGLE - SEAN AND RENNIE

	as they get to their feet, holding each other tight, 
	looking down on the now-dead undead creature.

	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (N.Y.) (CRANE SHOT)

	as our heroes arise into the neon-filled big city 
	wonderland, relieved to be alive, gazing around at the 
	awesome spectacle known as Times Square. A huge DIGITAL 
	CLOCK tells us it's a quarter to midnight. Sean wraps his 
	arm around her.

				SEAN
		It's over, Rennie. It's finally over.

	Camera RISES ABOVE THEM, RACKING BACK TO THE SUBWAY EXIT. 
	Guess who has just made an encore...with more energy 
	than ever!!!

	SEAN AND RENNIE

	look all around them, having never been to a city as big 
	as this. They finally turn far enough around to spot 
	JASON in a series of three quick cuts, each one closer 
	than the last.

				SEAN
		God...please no...

	But Jason keeps on coming.

				RENNIE
		Somebody help us!! He's going to kill 
		us!!!

	But the heavy Times Square foot traffic ignores her, 
	bustling onward. Rennie and Sean have no choice but to 
	flee again.

	JASON

	shoves his way through the preoccupied pedestrians; 
	they've certainly seen weirder characters than him here. 
	He moves past a group of STREET URCHINS listening to some 
	rap from their ghetto blaster. His foot obliterates 
	their stereo system with one stride. They instantly pull 
	out switchblades and chains.

				STREET URCHIN
		You're dead meat, slime bag.

	Jason stops, turning around, towering over the kids. He 
	has blood and gore caked everywhere, his skin charred 
	from the electrocution. Jason starts to remove his mask, 
	facing them squarely.

	TIGHT ON STREET URCHINS

	as Jason's mask comes off out-of-frame. Their tough faces 
	turn to putty, scared completely shitless.

				STREET URCHIN
		Hey man, it's cool, it's cool...

	They turn tail and race like the wind. Jason steps 
	forward so that we're looking at the back of his head, 
	never seeing his naked face. He slips his hockey mask on 
	again, turns into a CLOSE UP, then exits.

	INT. TIMES SQUARE DINER - NIGHT

	filled with noise, smoke and derelicts. A tough, 
	redheaded WAITRESS with a thick Brooklyn accent stands 
	behind the countertop, a wall of mirrors behind her. The 
	front door bangs open with the entrance of Sean and 
	Rennie, rushing up to the waitress.

				SEAN
			(out of breath)
		You have to call the police...

				RENNIE
		Please, hurry...

	A telephone sits right next to her, but this is New York.

				WAITRESS
		There's a pay phone in back.

	They start to run.

				WAITRESS
		...but it's broken.

				RENNIE
		You don't understand -- there's a 
		maniac trying to kill us!!!

				WAITRESS
			(blase)
		Welcome to New York.

	There's no time for further response as JASON CRASHES 
	THROUGH THE DINER DOOR, MOWING A PATH STRAIGHT TOWARDS 
	THEM. Sean and Rennie run out the back as the Waitress 
	eyes Jason with complete disbelief.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as the BURLY CHEF comes out to confront him. Jason FLINGS 
	HIM HEAD FIRST INTO THE JUKEBOX.

	THE WAITRESS

	picks up the telephone, really pissed off.

	A BIKER

	climbs off his counter stool, revealing a HUGE BOWIE 
	KNIFE. Jason plows straight for him and the Biker STABS 
	JASON IN THE HEART. Jason has little reaction, pulling it 
	out, tossing it aside. The Biker's face goes wan, backing 
	away.

	THE WAITRESS

	stops in mid-dial. Fear is starting to register now.

	JASON

	lifts the very large man and EFFORTLESSLY HEAVES HIM INTO 
	THE MIRROR OVER THE COUNTER.

	THE WAITRESS

	feels the phone receiver slipping from her grasp, her 
	mouth trembling. She backs away from the beast as far as 
	she can. Jason has no time to waste on her, trampling out 
	the back after Rennie and Sean as the other patrons 
	shrink from him.

	INT. REAR OF DINER - SAME TIME

	as Sean fumbles to unlock three deadbolts and two chains, 
	finally getting the back door open and springing into:

	EXT. DEAD END ALLEY - NIGHT

	They run about ten yards before realizing the alley is a 
	dead end. Sean and Rennie start to head back the other 
	way when JASON MOWS OUT FROM THE DINER DOOR. Their vision 
	scatters everywhere in search of a retreat...

				RENNIE
		Look!

	She's spotted a MANHOLE COVER, slightly ajar. They 
	haven't the luxury of thinking about it, Sean sliding the 
	cover back as Jason comes forth.

	INT. SEWER - ENTRANCE CHAMBER - NIGHT

	as they descend into hell...a massive chamber consisting 
	of tall columns, slimy catacombs and three feet of 
	stagnant water. Their alternatives are nil; Sean and 
	Rennie join hands, wading through the swill, splashing 
	deeper into the labyrinth.

	ANGLE UP STAIRS

	as the dim streetlight glowing in the above world is 
	eclipsed by JASON, making his way down after them.

	INT. TUNNEL #1 - NIGHT

	An oval tunnel slanted downward into pitch blackness. 
	Dim overhead lights illuminate salt deposits and eery 
	rust formations. Rennie and Sean appear at the far end, 
	wading from the sewage as the tunnel rises toward us.

	TRACKING SHOT

	as they come forward at a brisk but cautious pace, 
	strangers in a very strange land.

	ANGLE - THEIR FEET

	sloshing through the slime. All is silent until Sean's 
	foot TRIPS OVER A BARREL labeled HUGHES CHEMICAL PLANT. 
	A vaporous green substance oozes out the rusty end of 
	the container, sizzling on the around.

	SEAN AND RENNIE

	carefully sidestep it, continuing on. They make it 
	another ten yards when A FIGURE LEAPS OUT FROM AN ALCOVE, 
	GRIPPING A HUGE WRENCH. Rennie's scream echoes through 
	the tunnel.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	...but it's a middle-aged SANITATION ENGINEER who lowers 
	the wrench, as frightened as they are.

				SANITATION ENGINEER
		What the hell are you kids doing down 
		here?

				SEAN
		Can you help us get out??

				SANITATION ENGINEER
		I sure can and we don't have a minute 
		to waste.

	He begins quickly packing up his tools.

				SEAN
		What do you mean?

				SANITATION ENGINEER
		Toxic waste, son. This sewer floods 
		out with the stuff on the 13th of 
		every month, right at midnight.
			(checks watch)
		And that's less than ten minutes from 
		now.

	Rennie looks down the dark tunnels in all directions, 
	swallowing hard.

				SANITATION ENGINEER
		Follow me.

	He clicks on his high powered flashlight and quickly 
	leads them down:

	INT. TUNNEL #2

	...no less threatening than the one they just left. When 
	they pass a lightless intersecting corridor, JASON EJECTS 
	HIMSELF FROM IT, TACKLING THE SANITATION ENGINEER AND 
	SEAN.

	THE FLASHLIGHT

	rolls through the muck, its beam splashing erratically 
	across the polluted walls.

	THE SANITATION ENGINEER

	begins BASHING JASON'S HEAD IN WITH HIS WRENCH but the 
	monster drags the kicking and screaming man into TUNNEL 
	#3.

	RENNIE

	tries to help up Sean but he's been knocked into the 
	opposite wall, barely conscious.

				SEAN
		Run, Rennie...

	She's struck with indecisive shock, looking into Tunnel 
	#3, seeing:

	A GRUESOME SHADOW ON THE WALL

	Jason arches his back with wrench in hand, hammering it 
	over and over into the Sanitation Engineer's skull.

	RENNIE

	backs away but does not run. The time has come to face 
	her fears.

	ANGLE - SHADOW ON TUNNEL #3 WALL

	as Jason takes one more vengeful stroke, finishing him 
	off. He steps from Tunnel #3 with the scarlet-coated 
	tool, his shadow becoming flesh. He moves straight for 
	Sean, who has no hope for escape. Jason cocks the wrench 
	over Sean's skull...and suddenly his hockey mask is 
	SPLASHED WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT. Jason stops, turning 
	directly into it.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	Rennie is blinding us with the sanitation Engineer's 
	flashlight, giving us only brief glimpses of herself in 
	the reflective wet surroundings.

				RENNIE
		You never got me in the lake, Jason. 
		And you're not going to get me now 
		either.

	Her voice is defiant. She carefully backstops, the 
	irritating light never leaving us.

	JASON

	has been sufficiently taunted. He moves after her.

	JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	as the bright beam leaves our eyes, Rennie dashing down 
	the intersecting tunnel (#1).

	TIGHT ON JASON'S FEET

	stomping through the sludge, picking up speed. He's 
	wanted to kill Rennie most of all.

	INT. TUNNEL #L

	as Rennie dashes up to the HUGHES CHEMICAL DRUM Sean 
	tripped over, using the back end of the flashlight to 
	crush in the can's rusted lid. The metal is flimsy but 
	still resists her blows. She frantically hammers harder.

	INT. TUNNEL #2 - TRACKING WITH JASON

	He's moving like a freight train now, an addict rolling 
	after his fix.

	INSERT - CHEMICAL DRUM

	as the butt of the flashlight dents the metal, ultimately 
	causing it to cave in.

	INT. TUNNEL INTERSECTION - JASON'S POINT OF VIEW

	--Looking through his unblinking eyes, whipping into 
	Tunnel #1...where we catch a fleeting glimpse of Rennie 
	flinging the contents of the oil drum. A half second 
	later a WAVE OF GRAY/GREEN LIQUID FLIES AT US...

	TIGHT ON JASON (SLOW MOTION)

	and his hockey mask is SPLASHED WITH TOXIC WASTE, 
	SEEPING INTO HIS MASK'S EYE SLITS. He careens back as if 
	her were a rabid dog receiving a load of point-blank 
	buckshot.

	RENNIE

	drops the can, fumbling for the flashlight again.

	CLOSE UP - JASON (EFX)

	as the radiant flashlight beam finds his mask, the 
	plastic beginning to bubble and melt. RUSH INTO A TIGHT 
	CLOSE UP AS JASON TEARS OFF HIS MASK, EXPOSING HIS 
	HIDEOUS FACE: rotted flesh, some of it sizzling from the 
	chemical. Worms slithering out his nostrils. And his 
	eyes...or lack thereof. They're like two raw quail eggs 
	frying in liquid green pollutant...and the yolks just 
	broke, running down his face.

	CLOSE ON FLASHLIGHT

	as the beam begins to waver in her quivering grasp. RISE 
	TO FIND RENNIE'S FACE, reacting to the stomach-turning 
	sight of Jason's visage. She grabs hold of her senses and 
	RUNS.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as Rennie skirts past the blinded creature: WHIP PAN WITH 
	HER as she turns down Tunnel #2, heading back toward 
	Sean. CONTINUE TO QUICKLY PAN AROUND until we've come 
	around 360 degrees and are back on JASON, in no way 
	ready to give up. He staggers after Rennie.

	INT. TUNNEL #2

	as Rennie skids up to Sean, still dazed. She grabs him, 
	shaking hard.

				RENNIE
		Get up, Sean!!!

	His eyes blink, only half coherent. Then an inconceivable 
	terror registers in her ears...A LOW, DEEP RUMBLING 
	SOUND, COMING FROM UP AHEAD. Her head jerks in the 
	direction of her planned retreat:

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW

	An ominously empty tunnel, soon to be filled with the 
	unthinkable. The sound of RUSHING LIQUID is growing at 
	leaps and bounds.

	TIGHT ON RENNIE

	as her trembling chin rises, looking at:

	ANGLE - TUNNEL #3 CEILING (EFX)

	The dim overhead lights are beginning to vibrate from 
	the approaching flood.

	RENNIE

	rotates her head and sees:

	JASON

	vision or no vision, he is lurching towards her 
	relentlessly. She is literally sandwiched between hell 
	and high water.

	RENNIE

	drags Sean to his feet with the strength of a possessed 
	woman, pulling him over to a SERVICE LADDER attached to 
	the intersecting alcove wall.

				RENNIE
			(screaming)
		Climb!!!

	She shoves him up it from below, Sean summoning 
	everything he's got to obey her. Rennie shoots a stare 
	back down the tunnel...

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)

	The overhead lights are banging around like an earthquake 
	has just hit; the liquid will be arriving any second. Her 
	vision WHIP PANS 180 DEGREES TO FIND JASON APPROACHING 
	FROM THE OPPOSITE END, groping around with his scaly arms 
	like the claws of a roto-tiller.

	ANGLE - LADDER

	as Rennie starts up after Sean, looking down and seeing:

	JASON

	within ten feet of them, shifting directly for the ladder 
	like he's working on some kind of radar.

	RENNIE

	slips on the rusty ladder, regaining her footing. and 
	rushing higher. She takes her final glance into the 
	tunnel, the ultimate horror registering in her corneas as 
	she sees:

	INT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX)

	A million gallons of green-brown toxic waste splash into 
	the far intersection, FILLING THE TUNNEL, FLOODING 
	STRAIGHT FOR CAMERA.

	JASON

	has just started to climb the ladder when the wind and 
	smell of the rushing toxic waste bombards him. His 
	decomposed head swivels to face:

	INT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX)

	Tons of lethal sewage, stopping for no one. Arriving in 
	seconds.

	JASON'S FINAL CLOSE UP (EFX/FIBER OPTIC LENS)

	He doesn't need vision to confirm what his other senses 
	already know. Jason's mouth begins to quaver...AND THE 
	FIRST WORDS HE HAS EVER SPOKEN COME OUT, IN THE VOICE OF 
	AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY:

				JASON
		Mmmmmmmmmommy...DON'T LET ME DROWN, 
		MOMMY...

	Camera speeds toward his gaping mouth and DOWN HIS THROAT 
	as lightning arcs off his mucous covered insides. We 
	sink deeper into his guts, fire and smoke flaring into 
	our eves, eventually coming to a WELL IN THE PIT OF HIS 
	STOMACH, FILLED WITH BLOOD...and EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON IS 
	DROWNING IN IT.

				YOUNG JASON
		Hhhhelp me....

	A split second later:

	EXT. TUNNEL #3 (EFX) (SLOW MOTION)

	The wall of deadly toxic liquid ENGULFS JASON.

	INT. TUNNEL #3 - ON RENNIE AND SEAN (EFX)

	The powerful flood thrashes the ladder about two inches 
	below Rennie's feet, the force of it fiercely shaking 
	their rusty support. They are clinging to the ladder with 
	their eyes squeezed shut. Praying for survival.

	INT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX)

	We are drowning in a chunky cloud of sewage, rushing over 
	and under us.

	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (EFX)

	The digital clock we saw earlier abruptly CHIMES 
	MIDNIGHT, HUGE BOLTS OF LIGHTNING CRACKING OVER 
	MANHATTAN.

	ANGLE - SEAN AND RENNIE (EFX)

	as the sewage level begins to drop. Rennie opens her 
	eyes, glancing straight down and seeing.

	RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)

	The ladder beneath them reappears...which gives way to a 
	PAIR OF HANDS GRIPPING THE BOTTOM RUNG. The liquid drops 
	further, unshrouding the now-dead corpse of EIGHT YEAR 
	OLD JASON. He's a relatively normal looking boy, 
	probably the way he looked back in 1957...right when he 
	drowned in Crystal Lake.

	Jason Voorhees has finally been put to rest.

	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (N.Y.)

	Rennie and Sean stagger out from a side street, holding 
	each other up...relief etched in their matured faces.

				SEAN
		I hear there's a statue here that's 22 
		stories tall.

	Rennie would smile if she could. She kisses his cheek. 
	They amble on.

	STALKING POINT OF VIEW

	...coming out from another alley, creeping up behind them 
	through a crowd of pedestrians. About the height of a 
	small child.

	RENNIE AND SEAN

	walk arm in arm, exhausted and oblivious to their 
	pursuer. But something, some innate perception causes 
	Rennie to slow...and stop. Her eyes register a horrid 
	fear and she WHIPS AROUND TO FACE...

	TOBY!

	Limping on all fours, filthy with grease-matted fur. The 
	whimpering dog crawls up to her, Rennie bending down, 
	hugging her animal like she'll never let go.

				RENNIE
		Oh Toby...

	HIGH ANGLE CRANE SHOT (N.Y.)

	as Sean bends down too, ruffling the dog's fur, standing 
	again with Rennie. The three survivors enter the collage 
	of pedestrians, bright lights and skyscrapers. 

	It is finally over.

								FADE OUT.

					THE END
JASON-X
	BY TOD FARMER
	REVISED ROUGH DRAFT
	MAY 24, 1999

	FADE IN:

	DARKNESS.

	A scream rises to an ominous crescendo as we SHOCK CUT INTO -

	MONTAGE of fast moving clips.  Death, destruction, fear.  All images 
	taken from the previous ten Friday The 13ths.  

	AGAIN, DARKNESS.

								OPEN ON:

	The year is 2455. The place is Old Earth. Barren, void of life, a 
	hazardous and violent planet. The sky is blood red with spiked clouds of 
	dark gray.  It is beautiful, but frighteningly foreign.

	BLUE LIGHTNING CRACKLES as several figures rush through a DUST STORM 
	below. 

	Small groups of people, wearing thick dusters, goggles and masks, work 
	nearby. Some dig in the cracked earth, others take assorted readings 
	with strange devices.

	This is an archeological expedition.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  DARK PLACE

	The dust storm rages outside. Two figures are looking closely at a small 
	object buried in the dirt. One of them pulls a device out of their pouch 
	and slowly, gently picks up the object. The other uses a magnetic tool 
	to remove the dirt.

				FEMALE VOICE
		Careful . . .

				MALE VOICE
		I know.

	They take off their masks and goggles. They are both young. ADRIENNE 
	female (17) watches as STONEY male (18) studies the object closely.

				STONEY
			(reading)
		Not guaranteed, if used After 2198.

	CLOSE UP of the object. It's an unopened condom.

				ADRIENNE
			(smiles)
		You thinking what I'm thinking?

	Stoney tosses the high tech equipment over his shoulder and rips open 
	the condom as Adrienne rips her clothes off.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	They are in a half buried mini-van.  It rocks violently from the raging 
	storm outside and from the raging lust inside.

	BACK INSIDE THE VAN.

				ADRIENNE
			(breathless)
		What about Kkinsa?

	STONEY is desperately trying to take off her bra.

				STONEY
		It's over between us. You're the
		only one for me!

	METAL SCREECHES! THE FLOOR COLLAPSES!

	They fall some ten feet, RUBBLE RAINING down on top of them.

	INT.  DARK CORRIDOR

	A rusty metal ladder. Debris everywhere. Half inch layers of dust cover 
	everything. Dead. Lifeless.

				STONEY
		You okay?

	Adrienne sits up, shines her light down the long metal corridor. She 
	turns her light on STONEY then sees something over his shoulder.

	SHE SCREAMS A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM.

	We PULL BACK, out of the tunnel, through the van as the sounds of the 
	storm drown out ADRIENNE'S SCREAM.

								CUT TO:
	EXT.  BASE CAMP

	The digging and readings have stopped. A group approaches a time scarred 
	shuttle and begin loading their packs into the cargo belly.

	FAT LOU (40), rail thin, possible female, pilot, appears at the top of 
	the shuttle ramp.

				FAT LOU
			(yelling over the wind)
		Let's go! Time to load up!

	YLLO(33), a professor of archaeology lowers his veil. 

				YLLO
			(yelling)
		I'm missing two!

				FAT LOU
		Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have
		left this rock an hour ago!

				BOEMAN
			(eyes a device)
		North three clicks.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. MINI-VAN - DAY

	YLLO and the rest of the group run into view. BOEMAN (18), husky, 
	physical; holds out a device and checks the reading.

	He points to the rusted out mini-van sitting on its belly.

				BOEMAN
			(yelling)
		There!

	KICKER(30), bulky, short on temper, rushes up wearing futuristic 
	military garb -

				KICKER
		Yo, Teach, what the fuck?

				YLLO
		We're missing two of the kids!

				KICKER
		Get your ass back to the shuttle.
		I'll check it out.

	KICKER moves past the group and into the Van.

				YLLO
		Not without me!

	The rest of the gang look at each other and climb into the Van.

	INT. ANCIENT CORRIDOR

	YLLO and the others climb down a rusted ladder. Metallic walls, 
	graffiti, cluttered floors. No Stoney or Adrienne. A sign from the 
	ceiling states -

	CRYSTAL LAKE RESEARCH FACILITY.

	They all take off the goggles and masks. The rest of the group consists 
	of DELONGPRE(18) good looking, smart ass; JANESSA(17) sexual, scheming 
	AZRAEL(17) SMALL, COCKY; KKINSA(16), insecure, problematic; 
	THORGAN(17), a nerd but doesn't know it.

				YLLO
		Amazing! But, how . . I've been coming
		here for ten years. We never picked this up on
		our . . . KAY-EM?

	KAY-EM 14, a cybernetics science droid, removes her veil. She's 
	gorgeous, but there's something off about her look. Something synthetic.

				KAY-EM 14
		The air's laced with type two ozone,
		it reads as a solid.

				THORGAN
		Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.

				KAY-EM 14
		In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved
		their facilities underground to escape . . .

				KICKER
		All right, all right, enough with the history
		lesson. Lets find these two quick . . so I can kick
		some little punk ass.

	Kkinsa shines a flashlight around the dark tunnel.

				KKINSA
		I have an idea, why don't you go find
		them and we'll get the hell out of here!

	KKINSA turns and finds herself face to face with - -

	A CORPSE! Easily two-hundred years old it hangs from the wall, impaled 
	through the forehead by an iron spike. 

	KKINSA SCREAMS!

	Kicker yanks a weapon from his back, locks and loads as 

	JANESSA falls back and lands in the lap of another corpse. She screams! 

	KAY-EM 14 SCREAMS at the top of her lungs. Everyone looks at the droid.

				KAY-EM 14
		Was that out loud?

				DELONGPREE
		Thorgan, have you been screwing with . . .

	THORGAN grabs the head off the CORPSE, with the spike through it's head.

				THORGAN
		Cool! This is an automatic "A".

	Azrael dumps the contents of his bag on the ground, an old boot, some 
	cds, and an ancient box of PLAYTEX . . . starts shoving the corpse into 
	his pack.
				AZRAEL
		I've got my project. What are you losers
		gonna do?

				KICKER
		Back to the shuttle! All of you!
		I'll find them.

				YLLO
		Relax, Soldier boy, this is amazing.
		These remains are two hundred years old.

	Yllo's light hits a sign hanging from the ceiling. DANGER. STAY OUT.

				BOEMAN
		Creepy.

				THORGAN
		Cool.

				KKINSA
		Okay, I'm outta here.

				YYLO
		Kay-Em, any thoughts?

				KAY-EM 14
		Girth is better than length and
		women prefer a shaved scrotum during
		oral sex.

	Yllo glares a Thorgan.

				THORGAN
		I'm trying to give her some personality.

				YLLO
		Well stop messing with her. I don't want
		a science droid with a personality. Now
		let's find them and get back. I want to
		get clearance to stay back and study this . . .

				KKINSA
		No way! I'm not staying here any longer . . .
		I have a life you know.

	A radio crackles.

				FAT LOU(V.O.)
		Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze!
		Get your ass back hre!

				YLLO
			(into radio)
		Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it.
		You won't believe what we found.
			(calls out)
		Adrienne! Stoney!

	Yllo rushes past the corpse. The others reluctantly follow. They pass 
	another hanging sign - Danger - THEY PASS ANOTHER CORPSE LYING ON THE 
	FLOOR, it's torso separated from it's legs. And this is just the 
	beginning. As they move down the corridor there are bodies everywhere.

				BOEMAN
		There was a hall of a battle down here.

	S they move further they break a laser beam . . . sparks fly. A WARNING 
	VOICE sounds.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Dan-danger. Do not enter-er.

	But the group keeps moving. 

				KKINSA
		I feel compelled to ask why we are
		ignoring that.

	A corpse lies on the floor before them, it's skeletal hand beneath a 
	warning written in ancient blood . . .

	HELP ME . . .

	Suddenly another CORPSE LEAPS at them, screaming like a banshee! 
	Everyone SCREAMS - It lands on Kkinsa, who totally freaks trying to get 
	the corpse off her. 

	DELONGPREE and YLLO help Kkinsa fight the rotting corpse. They hear 
	hysterical laughter and look up to see -

	ADRIENNE and STONEY . . . emerge from the shadows laughing 
	uncontrollably.

				DELONGPREE
		Damnit!

				YLLO
		What the hell are you two doing?!

	Kkinsa eyes Adrienne, then glares at Stoney.

				KKINSA
		You're toast, mister.

				YLLO
		You're both toast!

				ADRIENNE
		You gotta see this!

	They turn down the right corridor, passing beneath ceiling consisting of 
	a jumbled mess of jagged metal.

				THORGAN
			(re: ceiling)
		That's a strange design, don't you think?

				KICKER
		We don't have time for this shit.

	As they pass we see a section of the jagged metal ceiling twitch and 
	squeeze together. That can't be a good thing . . .

	STONEY and Adrienne stop at a huge metal door. Above the door . . . 
	CRYOGENICS LAB.

	Adrienne points to a small window in the door.

				DELONGPREE
		Yeah, so? I had Cryo 101 last year.

				ADRIENNE
		Check it out.

	With a smirk, Adrienne wipes the condensation from the small window in 
	the door. Drawn from the inside, in blood, is a final warning -

	A SKULL AND CROSSBONES 

				KKINSA
		So don't open the door.

				ADRIENNE
		Look beyond it, yesterday's news.

	Yllo pushes his way to the window.

	Shocked faces.

	INSIDE the blue tinted room we see a huge domed Cryo cylinder. It's 
	massive, but our attention is pulled to the corner of the room. Curled 
	up into a ball, is a body - female, young.

				YLLO
		Is that?

				KAY-EM 14
		The room's still operational.
		She's perfectly preserved.

	Yllo's face lights up, grabs his radio.

				YLLO
			(into radio)
		Fat Lou, bring the ship to the
		following coordinates. Call Grendel,
		have them power up the labs, we're bringing
		in the find of the century!

				KICKER
		Now wait a minute! I don't think you
		should open that door.

				YLLO
		This is a science excursion corporal.
		Just stay out of the way.

	Yllo turns to the kids. He's very excited.

				YLLO
		Okay, no screwing around. This is the real
		thing. Do exactly what I say. Okay Thorgan, 
		open it up.

	Thorgan pops the cover from a control panel and hooks up a small gadget.

				KKINSA
		You're opening the door?
		What about the . . . ?

	She points to the skull and crossbones. 

				DELONGPREE
		I'm thinking we should call in some
		experts.

				YLLO
		This is your find people. You want to
		give your credit away?

				DELONGPREE
		I was just saying . . .

				THORGAN
		The cryo unit leaked. The computers
		sealed the room. No airborne viruses
		no hazardous materials. I've shut down the
		until. Alright, stand back. 

				KAY-EM 14
		Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses
		will render you unconcious.

				DELONGPREE
		Knock you on your ass pal. 

	They don their face masks as  . . . Fshhhhhshshsh. The metallic door 
	cracks open causing a powerful backdraft. The freezing cold air mixes 
	with the air outside the chamber creating a strange gray gas. Ice 
	crystals crack and fall to the floor.

	EXT.  CRYO CELL

				YLLO
		Kay-Em!

	Kay moves into the room ahead of the others.

	INT.  CRYO CELL

	CLOSE ON KAY-EM'S EYES

	They are not human. Mechanical, digital, but alluring. They dilate, open 
	up. Colored lasers shoot forth, slicing through the gas, scanning the 
	body.

	--which itself is slumped over. An icicle of frozen blood from, the 
	wound in her shoulder, props the body up.

	The other enter the icy chamber.

				DELONGPREE
		I speak on behalf of the group
		when I say . . . that's fucked.

				KAY-EM 14
		Female, nineteen years old, eight months . . .
		34-26-34 . . . bitch is built like a brick
		shit house.

				YLLO
		Thorgan?!!!

				THORGAN
		Sorry. I'll fix her when we get back.

				KAY-EM 14
		Time of hibernation 2049.
		Crystallization at seventeen percent.
		Suggest extensive Nanotech. Chances of
		rejuvenation eight-one percent.

				KKINSA
		What's going on?

				DELONGPREE
		She's dying.

				JANESSA
		Bitch looks dead to me.

	The RADIO CRACKLES . . .

				SERGEANT BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Yllo, Sergeant Brodski. Get your ass
		back to the shuttle!!

				YLLO
		Janessa, stretcher.
			(into radio)
		Keep your shirt on, sergeant. We have
		a medical emergency here not tot mention the
		discovery of a lifetime.

				SERGEANT BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Kicker! Get them the hell out of there!

	Janessa removes a Metallic cube from her backpack, clicks a button and a 
	flat stretcher expands and hovers a few feet off the ground.

	Kicker grabs Yllo.

				KICKER
		We're outta here!

	Yllo pulls away, leans over the frozen girl, grabs the frozen string of 
	blood and -CRACK-breaks it off.

				YLLO
		Fine, grab that end.


	Kicker sighs and helps Yllo lift the frozen girl and place her curled 
	body on the stretcher.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As thorgan stands at the massive Cryo-Unit -

				THORGAN
		Hey check this out!

	Protruding from the door is the tip of a machete.

				THORGAN
		This caused the leak and there's an
		occupant. 

	Thorgan yanks the door open.

				KICKER
		Don't touch that!

	Gas rolls out. Suddenly ALARMS SOUND and LIGHTS STROBE.

				KKINSA
		This is bad, no?

				THORGAN
		Relax, it's only a  glitch in the
		system. 

				JANESSA
		First field trip and you think
		you're a Scientist. Move out of the
		way geek. 

	JANESSA moves to look inside the chamber. 

	As the gas and steam clear - we hear the sound of CRACKING ICE, see a 
	jagged mass of frozen crystals . . . and within it . . . a body. A chunk 
	of ice CRACKS and falls tot he floor then THE MASK of JASON VOORHEES 
	looms forward!

	JANESSA screams as JASON'S BODY, stiff as a board, CRASHES to the ground 
	sending ice shrapnel everywhere!

				DELONGPREE
		Jesus, used to make the suckers big
		didn't they?

	Again, Kay-Em's eyes scan the frozen body.

				KAY-EM 14
		Subject was dead prior to incubation.

	Yllo moves to get a good look at Jason.

				YLLO
		My God, look at him. Why would they freeze
		a dead body?
			(a beat)
		Alright, load him up, and let's get out
		of here!

	OVER HIS SHOULDER - HALL

	A pair of three foot metallic spiders drop on thin wires to the floor.

	BACK INSIDE 

	One of Boeman's gadgets starts to BEEP.

				BOEMAN
		Er, guy? I'm picking up some movement.

	FZZZZT . . . Azrael screams as a laser slices into the room. His left 
	arm falls to the ground!

	Kay-Em rushes to him. Her finger pops open. A needle appears. She 
	injects him. The drugs take immediate effect.

				AZRAEL
		Cool . . . check out my arm.

	CLINK - CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK.

	HALL

	The metallic spiders, lasers attached to their bodies, CLANK towards our 
	heroes. 

				YLLO
		Kicker!

				KICKER
		Defense droids. I'm on it.

	Kicker slams the Cryo door shut as lasers slice into it.


				KKINSA
		There goes prom night.

	Kicker clicks at a gadget attached to his forearm.

				KICKER
		They're only class two. I can
		handle this. No problem.

				AZRAEL
		Not a problem?!

	Kay-Em injects him again.

				AZRAEL
		I'm missing a fucking arm heeeerrrr-
			(re:shot)
		Oh, that's dreamy.

	The lasers begin strategically slicing through hinges.

				JANESSA
		Okay rent-a-cop, do your shit.
		I gotta date tonight.

				KICKER
		Stand back!

	He pulls a gadget from his pack, punches in a series of buttons.

				YLLO
		We have to get these two back in one piece!

	Kay-Em turns to the frozen girl.

				KAY-EM 14
		Subject is critical. Needs nano stabilization
		immediately.

				YLLO
		Kicker! Do something!

				ADRIENNE
		Oh Gawd! I wish it would stop doing that.

	At her feet, Azrael's arm twitches spastically.

				AZRAEL
			(drugged up)
				That is soooo cool!

	Kicker cracks the door and tosses his gadget.

	KAFOOM!

				KICKER
				Come on!

	Kicker throws open the door and starts BLASTING! Yllo and the kids 
	follow him into the hall, the two stretches in tow. They disappear 
	around the bend - towards the exit.

	A beat then . . . screaming. They run back into view. Behind them - -

	CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK.

	A dozen laser wielding spiders make chase! Some are old and rusty, other 
	slump over and short out, but those that work . . . work well.

	INT.  LONG CORIDOOR

	Kicker is running backwards, BLASTING with his weapon. Lasers FLASHING 
	all around our group. 


				KKINSA
		Have I told you guys how much I hate this class?

				KICKER
		We need another exit! I'll hold 'em off!
		Teach, find a way out!

				BOEMAN
		I'm on it!

				KICKER
		Sorry kid, leave this to the pros.

				BOEMAN
			(re: gadget)
		Left at the end of the hall!

	A laser strikes the body of Jason Voorhees, breaking off a chunk of ice.

				THORGAN
			(reading from device)
		They're not after us. Their sensors are
		locked in on . . . him!

	Thorgan points to JASON'S STRETCHER.

				KICKER
		Leave him behind!

				YLLO
		No! He's coming with us!

	They round a corner . . .

				BOEMAN
		Here. We're one meter from the surface!

				KICKER
		Then duck.

	CHA-CHUNK . . he cocks his grenade launcher and fires at the ceiling.

	KABLOOM!! Rocks and falling debris reveal the violent surface above.

				DELONGPREE
		It's too high!

	Kicker rolls around the corner and starts blasting!

				KICKER
		Make it happen!

				JANESSA
		They're just subclass B droids.
		I'm so not impressed.

				BOEMAN
		Stoney, you catch.

	Stonet leaps, grabs the lip and tosses his feet up and over in a very 
	acrobatic move.

	Boeman kneels, cups his hands to make a step. He begins tossing his 
	friends up to Stoney as Kicker makes war in the hall!

	Soon, Boeman and Kicker are the only two left.

				BOEMAN
		We're clear! Let's go!

	Boeman leaps up, grabs the lip and pulls himself to safety. 
	He spins around and holds his arm out for Kicker.

	Kicker leaps, grabs Boeman's hand. Boeman strains to pull him up as 
	spider's cover the floor below them, then -

	A spider crawls up Kicker's leg - a spike shoots out into Kicker's 
	thigh. He screams.

				KICKER
		They've got me! Let go!

				BOEMAN
		No!

	Boeman ROARS and pulls harder. Kicker's pack RIPS from his body - the 
	spiders falling with the pack.

	EXT. SURFACE - DAY

	The sand storm is raging on the surface. Kicker lands on top of Boeman.

				BOEMAN
		That wasn't so bad.

	Kicker bites the pin from a grenade, tosses it into the hole.

				KICKER
			(yells)
		This will be!

	The others dive for the ground as -  - 

	KAFOOM! A FIREBALL rises up out of the hole!

				THORGAN
		Nice touch.

				BOEMAN
		And you said high school was boring.

	Our team fights the winds and rushes up the ramp of the waiting shuttle.

	FAT LOU is waiting at the ramp. He looks at the two stretchers.

				FAT LOU
		Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .

				YLLO
		Just get us to the ship!

	Azrael stops in a panic!

				AZRAEL
		Oh shit I forgot my arm!

				ADRIENNE
		Here. Dumbass.

	She hands him the severed limb as they race up the ramp.

	The door closed, the SHUTTLE LIFTS OFF THE GROUND and soars into the 
	sky.

								CUT TO:

	EXT.  ORBIT AROUND OLD EARTH - LATE

	THE SHUTTLE maneauvers through the junk that now floats in orbit. Old 
	satellites, the front quarter of a Space Shuttle, etc.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

	Navigating through the debris, FAT LOU grabs a radio mike.

				FAT LOU
		This is Beowulf approaching from
		sector fifteen.

	Through the front windshield we see - - 

	GRENDEL, a class IV Catamaran Transport. It looks like two huge 
	torpedoes attached by three thin walkways. Not new, but by no means old.

				BERNIE(V.O.)
		I've got you, Beowulf. Proceed with docking.
		And by the way, Brodski's pissed.

	INT.  DOCKING BAY

	The shuttle doors open revealing SERGEANT BRODSKI and six E-X GRUNTS 
	standing with weapons at the ready.

	As the group gather their equipment and begin to move the two 
	stretchers, Brodski stepsi n front of YLLO.

				BRODSKI
		What the hell were you thinking?

	YLLO ignores him, turns to his team.

				YLLO
		Get them in the lab!

				BRODSKI
		Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.

	The E-X Grunts step in front of kids.

				YLLO
			(to the grunts)
		Back off!

				YLLO
			(back to the kids)
		Get them to the labs . . . Now!

	The team moves through the Grunts.

				YLLO
		What the hell are you doing?

	Brodski looks down at the stretcher with the young woman's body on it.

				BRODSKI
		My god! This is way over your head, pal.
		We need to call some experts and . . .

				YLLO
		I am an expert!

				BRODSKI
		You're a teacher.

				YLLO
		Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me.
		She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab,
		she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking
		head!

				BRODSKI
		What if they're carrying? Did you even check?

				KAY-EM 14
		Subjects scan virus clean . . .

	Brodski attempts to shove Kay-Em out of his way . . . BUT she stands her 
	ground . . . grabs his crotch.

				KAY-EM 14
		Mmm, you like the rough stuff don't you, big boy?

	Brodski and Yllo look at Thorgan.

				BRODSKI AND YLLO
		Thorgan!!

				THORGAN
		Sorry . . . I'll fix her . . . I promise.

				BRODSKI
		How do you know that piece of cursed rock down
		there doesn't carry something metal tits can't
		detect?

				YLLO
		Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.

				BRODSKI
		Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.

				YLLO
		I don't give a shit. This one's prime for
		decryonization. We're brining her back.

				BRODSKI
		I still think we should send for a team of
		real scientists.

				YLLO
		I am a scientist you asshole! This could be
		the most important discovery in 400 years. Do
		you have any idea what a find like this could
		mean?

				BRODSKI
		Right now, I care only for the safety of this
		crew. You don't know anything about these two -

	The stretcher with JASON moves by them. Brodski looks down.

				BRODSKI
		Jesus what the hell is that?

				YLLO
		That's exactly what we need to find out.
		Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you
		where discovery is concerned. Now step aside.
		I have a medical emergency to deal with.

	Reluctantly, Brodski steps aside. As the kids follow, Azrael bumps into 
	DALLAS, one of the E-X GRUNTS. Azrael glares at him, brandishing the 
	severed limb.

				AZRAEL
		Watch it punk, I'm armed.

				DALLAS
		Punk?

	Dallas slaps Azrael across the back of the head as he passes.

				AZRAEL
		You'll pay for that.

	Dallas and the grunts laugh.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

	FAT LOU and BERNIE, a synthetic pilot existing only from the waist up in 
	his pilot's chair, set course for home.

				BERNIE
		Gravitation nominal. Thrusters engaged.

				FAT LOU
			(into radio)
		Grendel to Grendel's mother, we are enroute.

		Copy that, Grendel. Computer ovverides deployed.
		See you in two days.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  LABS

	Dark, quiet, until the lights glare on.

	LAB ONE doubles as a Medical Research center and Sick Bay. GLASS JARS 
	filled with some of the strangest creatures ever seen cover the back 
	wall.

	Yllo and the students bring the girl in. Their movements are hurried and 
	economical . . .but they're excited.

				YLLO
		Get her prepped for the soup.
			(to Adrienne)
		Take the other one to lab two.

				ADRIENNE
		Yllo, this is my find. My project.
		I want to be in here.

				YLLO
		I know, dear, but this is too big a 
		discovery. I need you to prep the second
		body.

				ADRIENNE
		But, I want . . .

				YLLO
		This is a discovery that we will all share.
		We have to work as  a team. Now go. Stoney
		go with her.

	Thorgan and Delongpre lift the Girl onto the rejuvenation table.

	Stoney whispers something to Kkinsa before he exits with Adrienne.

	Kkkinsa nods and wheels a huge SCANNING MACHING over to the Girl. She 
	starts the scan as Delongpree and Thorgan cut the clothes off their 
	"find".

				THORGAN
		Have I told you guys how much I love this class?

	Delongpree brushes some of the melting crystals from her face.

				DELONGPREE
		She's beautiful . . .

	Thorgan cuts her shirt off.

				THORGAN
		Damn! Talk about your hard nipples.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne and Stoney push Jason into the lab.

	LAB TWO is smaller and less high-tech than LAB one. They shove JASON'S 
	body onto the EXAM TABLE. 

				ADRIENNE
		Fucking Yllo! Thinks he can push me aside.
		This is my find!

	She removes chucks of ice from JASON'S FACE.

				STONEY
		You know even though we both found this guy ,
		I'll let you take the credits. You can take it 
		from here.

				ADRIENNE
		Oh thanks . . . fine go. It's just another
		dissection. You'll only get in my way.

				STONEY
		Cool. Besides, you're into this shit.

	Stoney leaves Adrienne alone with Jason . . . and he is THAWING.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo walks around the room, overseeing all the action. He's excited and 
	cocky.

				YLLO
		Hands on training is rare. You should consider
		yourself lucky.

				AZRAEL
		Lucky?!

	Azrael sits in a large machine. This is . . .

	The NANO-TECH 2000. It can repair non-fatal injuries with the use of 
	Nano-Technology. 

	Azrael is scanned by the NT-2000 and so is his injury. It goes into 
	action as articulated mechanics begin to re-attach his arm.

				AZRAEL
		Another hour and I'd have lost
		the arm.

				JANESSA
		Oh, was that the hand you beat off with?

				AZRAEL
		I better get extra credit for this shit.

				YLLO
		Delongpree, Status. How you doing?

	Delongpree cuts her underpants from her body and tosses them over his 
	shoulder.

				DELONGPREE
			(swallows hard)
		I'm Okay.

				STONEY
		Well she's definitely a blond.

				JANESSA
		Oh that's scientific.

				DELONGPREE
		You think all girls from the past
		looked this good?

				JANESSA
		She's not that great.

				THORGAN
		400 years . . . I bet she'll be horny.

				YLLO
		Okay, people, we need to Learn everything
		there is to learn about our two guests. And
		if all goes well, I'll mention each one of
		you when I make my nobel prize speech.

				DELONGPREE
			(underbreath)
		Yeah, right.

	Delongpre presses a button on the table. The edges of the table RISE UP 
	to create a clear dome around the table. A hot gel-like substance shoots 
	out of small tubes. The FROZEN BODY is covered in the NANO-GEL.

	Thorgan checks a monitor.

				THORGAN
		Everything looks good.

	Yllo smiles - gushing self-satisfaction.

				YLLO
		Turn up the heat.

	Adrienne is wearing a metal eyepiece while staring at a computer screen. 
	No hands. 

				ADRIENNE
		Done. Crystallization remains
		seventeen percent.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne scans Jason with a machine identical to the one Kkinsa was 
	using in LAB ONE.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Crystallization at sixty percent
		Subject classification . . . deformity.

				ADRIENNE
		Put it on the screen.

	A monitor lights up with a scan of Jason's body. The internal organs are 
	distorted and bloated. She keys into the next lab. 

	Back to lab one.

				ADRIENNE(V.O.)
			(over speaker)
		Guys, check out beef-cakes scan.

	Jason's 3-D scan appears on one of the big monitors.

				ADRIENNE(V.O.)
		Look at the brain.

	Within Jason's skull is a brain the size of a golf-ball.

				JANESSA
		It's just like Thorgan's.
		What do you think this means?

	Thorgan grabs his crotch.

				THORGAN
		This is what it means right here.

				JANESSA
		Small brains make your balls itch?

				DELONGPRE
		And what's with the headgear?

				KAY-EM 14
		The mask is an artifact from a
		sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.

				BOEMAN
		Hockey.

				KAY-EM 14
		A medieval sport where two teams
		club one another with elongated
		sticks. Very sexy.

				YLLO
		What do you expect from a culture that
		sucked its planet dry of resources.

	She eyes Stoney. He smiles knowingly.

				KKINSA
		This bores me.

				DELONGPRE
		She's red. Body temp 98.6. This
		is so cool.

				YLLO
		Prep defib and start the cell 
		reconstruction.

	KAY-EM 14 presses a series of buttons. A long needle punctures the 
	GIRL'S NECK. Jason's scan is replaced by the girl's. We see 
	Nanotechnology going to work replacing her wounds and damaged cells.

				THORGAN
		Cool!

	Kkinsa and Stoney back out of the room unnoticed.

				YLLO
		Is she stable?

				KAY-EM 14
		Subject is stable and cell
		reconstruction has begun.

				DELONGPRE
		Now what?

				YLLO
		We wait. I need about fifteen.
		Call me if there are any changes.
		If she farts I want a full report.

				AZRAEL
		Don't I deserve a sick day or some
		shit like that?

	Yllo exits.
								CUT TO:

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	The door swishes open. Stoney enters with Kkinsa close behind. Kkinsa 
	raises her hand.

				KKINSA
		Adrienne?! Of all people!

				STONEY
		You're jealous.

	Stoney moves back. Kkinsa moves close hand raises above her head.

				KKINSA
		Adrienne?!

				STONEY
		It's over between us. You're the
		one I want.

	Kkinsa grabs the back of her shirt and pulls it over her head.

				KKINSA
		Bed!

	A bed slides out from the wall, hitting Stoney in the back of the legs, 
	causing him to fall on the bed. Kkinsa straddles him. Stoney grabs her. 
	The two fall into a feverish kiss.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne is prepping various medical tools. JASON'S BODY is laying on an 
	autopsy table. Steam rises from his body as thick ooze drips from his 
	thawing flesh.

	She turns on a computer monitor.

				ADRIENNE 
		Prepare organ vats.

	Two metal sinks hiss as liquid nitrogen flows.

				ADRIENNE
		Okay big boy . . . 

	She picks up a long, sharp chrome tool and walks over to Jason's body.

				ADRIENNE
			(continuing)
		. . . let's see what you're made of.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  YLLO'S CABIN

	Yllo enters and approaches a computer console. The door behind him 
	opens. Janessa enters.

				JANESSA
		All this science shit, makes me horny.
			(removes her shirt)
		Take off your cloths, we don't have much
		time.

	She drops her shirt to the floor. Yllo retrieves it, hands it back.

				JANESSA
		You're quicker than usual.

				YLLO
		Later.

				JANESSA
		You prefer an apple?

	He forces her into the hall, closes the door, locks it. He returns to 
	the console.

				YLLO
			(to console)
		Secure line. Perez, Joshua,
		Solaras Space Lab. Connect.

	EXT.   SOLARAS SPACE LAB - EST.

	A huge cylindrical ship, floats quietly. We hear a BEEPING sound.

	INT.   SOLARAS SPACE LAB - PEREZ QUARTERS

	Joshua Perez rolls over, clicks on a light. He fumbles for a button, 
	presses it. A wall monitor lights up revealing Yllo's face.

	INTERCUT AS NEEDED

				PEREZ
		You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?

				YLLO
		We just left old Earth. You'll never believe
		what we found.

	Yllo inserts a disk into the console.

				YLLO
		I'm sending you the files.

				PEREZ
			(testy)
		Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient
		Farrari . . .

		YLLO
		Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels.
		See what kind of payday we're looking at.

				PEREZ
			(begins download)
		Alright, I'm . . .
			(reacts to file)
		No way . . . is this a joke?

	Yllo smiles.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne leans over JASON'S THAWING body. Oozing goo drips from the 
	slab.

	She is inches away from his steaming mask. She taps it with her tool.

	She begins working at the straps of the mask, cutting the overgrown 
	flesh away.

	INT.  YLLO'S CABIN

	Yllo studies a monitor. On screen: a document entitled, EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS 
	OF DISCOVERY. He talks on the secure line.

				YLLO
		Hypothetically, how much are we talking?

				PEREZ(V.O.)
		If you're for real, you're looking at a million
		credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include
		touring and guest lectures. When can you get them
		here?

				YLLO
		I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?

				PEREZ(V.O.)
		See you then . . . doctor.

	Yllo's face glows with thoughts of fame and fortune.

					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  HALL OUTSIDE YLLO'S QUARTERS

	Janessa has hooked up a small device to the door. She's heard every 
	word.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Kkinsa rips off Stoney's shirt. Stoney grab her and rolls on top of her.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	CLOSE ON JASON'S HAND - it curls, the frozen joints CRACKLE.

	Adrienne turns from Jason's mask. A large wad of goo hits the floor. She 
	turns back to her work. Slicing flesh away from the mask.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Stoney and Kkinsa kiss passionately as they wrestle to get each other's 
	pants off.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne tries to pry the Mask off . . . but it holds firm.

	She stick s a long sharp tool into an eye hole. We hear disgusting 
	noises as she probes JASON'S EYE SOCKET.

	She removes the tool, and on the end is Jason's eye!

	Holding it close she looks at it. It is bloated and distorted. She drops 
	it in a specimen jar and takes it over to her work station.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Kkinsa rolls on top of Stoney. She holds his arms down as she whispers 
	in his ear.

				KKINSA
		How bad do you want it?

	Stoney gets his arms free and rolls on top of her.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	JASON'S LEG JERKS!

	Adrienne turns again, then approaches.

				ADRIENNE
		Interesting. Record. Thawing has
		caused possible muscle spasms.

	She frowns at the disgusting ooze. A mixture of swamp waters, blood, and 
	other thawing bodily fluids, puddle around Jason's body.

	She moves back to her work station and picks up JASON'S BLOATED EYE. She 
	takes out an autopsy laser and cuts through the center of the eye.

	The laser slices through the fatty tissue as thick black goop drips out 
	of the eye. Adrienne stares into a microscope. This is all very 
	interesting.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Stoney lies on top of Kkinsa.

				KKINSA
		Yes . . . yes . . . that's it!

	. . . a moment, then both GASP as he enters her.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	JASON sits up!

	CLOSE on ADRIENNE as she studies the dripping eye. She puts the laser 
	down and turns to the slab and freezes.

	JASON IS GONE!

	She spins around only to find Jason standing behind her. He grabs her by 
	the throat! She can't scream. She kicks wildly as he studies her.

					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Delongpre, Boemen, Kay-Em 14 and Thorgan wait and watch girl in the 
	NANO-GEL. Thorgan is getting impatient. He can't find something.

				THORGAN
		Anybody seen the reticulator?

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne is thrown into a work light. The room goes dark. 

	INT.  LAB ONE

				DELONGPRE
		Try next door, there was one there

	Thorgan exits.

	INT.  LAB TWO'S OBSERVATION ROOM

	The lights go. Thorgan looks around. Through the thick glass, where 
	JASON is killing Adrienne, is blackness.

				THORGAN
		Wakey wakey love birds . . . Yllo's
		gonna be pissed if he catches you fooling
		around instead of working.

	Thorgan roots through a drawer, his back to the glass.

	ANTE ROOM

	Through the glass beside him we see Adrienne screaming. But NO SOUND. 
	All rooms are air tight. Her head is smashed on the glass!

	Still screaming, her face recedes back into the darkness as Thorgan 
	looks over his shoulder.

				THORGAN
		Bye, lovebirds . . . Stoney, you dog.

	He exits.

	BACK TO JASON

	As he - -

	DUNKS Adrienne's head INTO ONE OF THE METAL SINKS. Her body goes limp. He 
	pulls her head up and stares at her frozen head, eyes open, mouth locked 
	in a scream.

	He thumps the head against a wall. IT SHATTERS! Jason drops the body 
	with a thud then turns to the - -

	DISSECTION TOOLS. He chooses a long silver cleaver.

	JASON'S BACK!

	EXT.  LAB ONE CORRIDOR

	Jason walks into the corridor from LAB TWO, steam still rising from his 
	cold body. He heads away from LAB ONE as soon as he's out of sight, YLLO 
	appears.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Delongpre wakes as Yllo enters.

				YLLO
		All right, lets do this. Thorgan
		begin the Defib program, Delongpre,
		ready the drainage units. Boerman get the
		others in here.

	Boeman grabs a wall mike.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Kkinsa straddles Stoney.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		We've got a heartbeat!

	Her back arches in ecstasy.

				KKINSA
		No shit, we've got a heart beat!

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Stoney, you copy? She's awake.
		You coming?

				STONEY
		Hell yeah I'm coming!

				KKINSA
		No . . . not yet!

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Yes, right now!

				STONEY
		YES !!!

				KKINSA
		NO!!! NO!!! NO!!! YES!!!

				STONEY
		YES!!!!!!

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Stoney, put your pants on and get
		your ass down here!

	They jump up grab their clothes and rush to the door. Stoney hits the 
	door release and the door SWISHES open revealing - -

	JASON VOORHEES!

	Standing in the hall. He swings the silver cleaver.

	Stoney sidesteps as Kkinsa SCREAMS. Stoney SLAMS his palm into the door 
	panel. The door SWISHES to close but Jason's hand reaches out and stops 
	it.

	ENGINES WINE as JASON STRUGGLES to force the door open.

	Stoney keeps POUNDING the panel, trying to make the door close but 
	Jason's too strong!

	Jason grabs Stoney by the arm, jerks him into the doorway and releases 
	the door.

	The door closes! Splitting Stoney from forehead to crotch!

	Splashed with blood, Kkinsa falls to the floor cowering . . .
	mumbling nonsensically. 

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo, Janessa, Thorgan, Boemen and Delongpre anxiously huddle around the 
	Frozen Girl's body. Probes dangle in the gel.

				YLLO
		It's time.

				DELONGPRE
		What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?

				YLLO
		I've waited long enough.
		Kay . . . you know what to do.

	Kay presses buttons. We hear the whine of something powering up . . .

	Brodski enters the lab.

				YLLO
		What the hell are you doing?

				BRODSKI
		My job.

				YLLO
		Fine, just stay out of my way.

	Running, freshly killed bodies at our feet. HEAVY BREATHING.

	Small fists beat against a door.

				GIRL'S VOICE
		Mom! Dad! It's loose! He's loose!

	The door swishes open revealing the dead bodies of a couple in their 
	forties.

	CLOSE ON THE GIRL

	We recognize her as the frozen girl. Her name, RIZZO (18), pretty.
	She screams. Turns.

	HER POV

	Standing at the end of the corridor, back lit and ominous is JASON 
	VOORHEES! He marches towards her.

	She runs. Snatches a headset from a wall mount.

				RIZZO
		Help me! Anyone! Somebody help me!

	STATIC from the radio. Jason closing.

	She reaches down and grabs a shot gun from a dead Security Guard. Chick-
	chick. KABLAM!

	Jason keeps coming.

	She runs.

	As she rounds a corner, we  see - -

	CRYOGENICS LAB

	She opens the door and enters the cold room. Slips on the wet frozen 
	ground, nearly falls.

	ON JASON as he rounds the corner, sees the open door.

	INT.   CRYO LAB

	Jason enters, his machete held ready. He stares at the Huge Cryo unit. 
	Door open. Otherwise the room is empty.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Hey!

	Jason turns. Rizzo is standing in the hall, the shotgun ready.

				RIZZO
		You son of a bitch!

	KABLAM! Jason slides backwards on the slick floor.

	KABLAM! Further, he nearly falls. 

	KABLAM! He stumbles, falls backwards into the cryo-unit.

	Rizzo slams her palm onto a console, the Cryo-unit door closes, JASON 
	INSIDE.

	RIZZO tosses the gun to the floor and types on a keypad.

	Steam HISSES, engines hum to life. The Cryo-Unit, Bucks violently.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Cryo-Unit activated.

	Slowly the unit goes silent, still. Rizzo stares at it, approaches 
	slowly, staring at the fogging glass -


	KA-CHING!

	The MACHETE BURSTS THROUGH THE GLASS, slicing into Rizzo's shoulder!

	ALARMS SOUND. The cryo lab's main door SLAMS shut.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Cryo-Unit leak. Lock down in progress.
		Security measures on line.

				RIZZO
		Nooooooo!

	She rushes toward the door. It won't budge.

				RIZZO
		Somebody! No!

	CHSHSHSHSHSH!

	Gas filters into the room from the leak in the Cryo-Unit.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Subject in computer unit has reached
		full incubation.

	Rizzo begins to fade. She stumbles.

				RIZZO
		No . . . 

	Cryo gas rolls along the floor . . .

	As blood pours from her wound, she reaches her bloody hand to the glass 
	window and draws -

	A SKULL AND CROSSBONES.

	-then passes out.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	RIZZO'S EYES pop open. She gasps for breath. Coughing and splitting the 
	Gel-like substance. She's sitting in a foot of gel, naked; Yllo, Brodski 
	and the kids around her.

				THORGAN
		That one did it!

	Yllo moves close to Rizzo.

				YLLO
		We should expect a moment of
		disorientation.

	WHAM! Rizzo punches Yllo in the nose.

				DELONGPRE
		Spunky . . .

				YLLO
		She broke my fucking nose!

				KAY-EM 14
		Again proving that your ancestors were savages.

				BRODSKI
		I like her already.

				KAY-EM 14
		Live signs full strength. Heart rate above normal - 

	Rizzo's disoriented, confused. Gel slops all around her.

				RIZZO
		Where..? Who . . .?
			(shock)
		I'm alive. You brought me back.

				YLLO
			(rubbing his nose)
		Obviously so.

	Rizzo looks down at her body, gel dripping off her naked flesh.

				RIZZO
		What the hell is this shit?

	Delongpre gives her a blanket. She covers herself.

				RIZZO
		How did I get here, how did you bring me back?

				YLLO
		Nanotechnology.

				RIZZO
		Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.

				YLLO
		We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.

				RIZZO
		30? How long was I out?

	Rizzo finally takes a good look at where she is. Something is very wrong 
	in her world.

				YLLO
		The year is 2455. You've been frozen
		for the past four hundred years.

	Rizzo gasps -- a shocking revelation.

				YLLO
		Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some 
		questions...

				RIZZO
		JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!

				THORGAN
		The hockey player? He a friend of yours?

				RIZZO
		Hockey player? He's not a ...

				THORGAN
		He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!

				RIZZO
		Old Earth?

				YLLO
		We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a
		few questions.

				RIZZO
		But...I...400 years?

				YLLO
		That's right, now if you could...

	Delongpre frowns at Yllo and moves to Rizzo.

				DELONGPRE
		It can wait. Let's get you cleaned up.

	Delongpre helps Rizzo off the table.

				YLLO
		Wait a minute...I need...

				BRODSKI
		Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.

				DELONGPRE
		Come on.

	INT.  LAB FOUR

	Rizzo stands at a small window looking out into space. Cleaned up she is 
	quite beautiful.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo?

	Rizzo is startled. She looks around.

				RIZZO
		Yeah?

	Delongpre comes through the door with a plate of food. 

				DELONGPRE
		I thought that after 400 hundred years,
		you just might have a little bit of an appetite.

	He puts the food on a small table and moves to the window.

				DELONGPRE
		You're on Grendel, a class IV Catamaran 
		transport.
		It's basically a school bus. We're on our way 
		back to Earth II.
		It's finals week.

	She turns back to the window.

				RIZZO
		You're telling me I'm a friggen class project?

	Delongpre flinches, expecting to be hit.

				DELONGPRE
			(a beat)
		Sort of. I mean, no, not really ...

	She collapses onto the bed.

				DELONGPRE
		I'll give you a moment alone. Do you
		want me to come get you when we start
		the dissection?

	Rizzo shrugs. She's lost everyone and everything. She's lot 400 years.

	Delongpre backs out of the room, closing the door behind him.

	Rizzo stares at the pile of her old clothes. She reaches into the pocket 
	of her tattered jacket and removes a set of keys. The key chain holds a 
	picture...a picture of her parents. She sits on the bed and starts to cry.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	As Delongpre enters all eyes turn to him.

				YLLO
		Well?

				DELONGPRE
		She needs a little time.

				YLLO
		More time...shit, she's had 400 years...

	Yllo laughs at his own joke.

				DELONGPRE
		That's really funny.

				YLLO
		I'd want her statements before we reach porch.
		Jesus, women.

				DELONGPRE
		Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything
		she went through?

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Dissection?

	Theyturn. Rizzo approaches Delongpre and Yllo.

				RIZZO
		Jason? He's on this ship?!

				YLLO
		Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in
		400 years...except for you, of course. Look if 
		you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking
		and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the
		publicity.

				RIZZO
			(glares)
		Are you finished?

	Yllo nods then --

	WHAM!

	Rizzo punches him again.

				YLLO
		God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!

				DELONGPRE
		Oh I like her a lot.

				BRODSKI
		I'm with you kid.

				RIZZO
		Where is he?

				BRODSKI
			(points)
		Lab two, relax. What's the matter?
		He's dead.

				RIZZO
		No, you're dead! You're all dead!

	She shoves Delongpre out of the way and out the door.

	INT.  LAB TWO - MOMENTS LATER

	The others enter to find Rizzo leaning over Adrienne's headless body.

				YLLO
		Jesus!

				JANESSA
		Oh my God! Adrienne?

				THORGAN
		What have you done?

				RIZZO
		What have I done?! Idiots.

	Thorgan throws up.

		BOEMAN
			(into a mike)
		Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an
		emergency!

				DELONGPRE
		Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?

				RIZZO
		I'll tell you where he is. He's walking
		around this ship, killing anything that
		moves.

				JANESSA
		Maybe she tripped.

	Brodski and Kicker burst into Lab Two, they react to the carnage.

				BRODSKI
		Jesus, God!

				KICKER
		Oh man, what the hell happened?

				RIZZO
		Jason! Can't you see? He did this.

				YLLO
		Impossible! He was dead before he entered
		Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could
		be alive.

				RIZZO
		I didn't say he was alive.

								CUT TO:

	INT.   GRID 52

	Azrael moves through a maze of walls and pipes. Stea, HISSES lights 
	STROBE. 

	He's dressed in full military garb, a huge gun strapped to his hsoulder.

	STALKING POV

	Something watching Azrael, his back to us. Azrael moves. The stalker
	closes in.

	Suddenly Azrael hits, rolls and comes up Blasting right at us.

	HIS POV

	A HUGE ALIEN CREATURE, fangs, claws and so on, leaps at him. THe big
	blaster hits home. The alien DISINTERGRATES.

	Sitting on the floor, Azrael sighs and wipes his brow.

	SUddenly, another alien rises up behind him with a hideos Screech. 
	There's nothing Azrael can do. He's a goner. Then --

	FZZT! A blast from elsewhere DISINTERGRATES THE CREATURE. MOVE TO 
	REVEAL--

	DALLAS, the grunt Azreael had words with earlier.

				DALLAS
		That's nine to four, geek-boy.

				AZRAEL
		You got lucky.

				DALLAS
		You got lucky. I could have waited until he
		ate your head.

				AZRAEL
		Speaking of which, duck!

	Dallas hits the deck as Azrael FIRES, disintegrating another. Beyond it 
	lunge a half dozen more.  Dallas and Azrael scramble to their feet,
	take aim, when --

	ONE OF THE ALIENS IS CUT IN HALF!

	GREEN GOO squirts from its body.

				AZRAEL
		What the?!

	JASON VOORHEES 

	SLASHES THROUGH another alien, splitting it down the middle.
	Then another.

				DALLAS
		He's good.

	Azrael smiles knowingly. He takes aim and lets loose a blast at Jason. 
	Aliens scatter as the blasts hits Jason dead on. Dallas joins in
	unloading on the hulinking terror.

	THeir assault has no effect on Jason whatsoever.

				DALLAS
		That sucks. Why won't he go down?

				AZRAEL
		Pause play.

	Suddenly the aliens freeze in place. Jason stares at them, then turns to 
	Dallas and Azrael.

				DALLAS
		He's not part of the program.

				AZRAEL
		Hey cool. They brought ancient
		hockey guy back to life.

	Jason walks up to them. Titls his head like a dog hearing a high-pitched 
	whistle.

	Why aren't they running.

				AZRAEL
		Hey! We're playing a game here.
		Get off the court!

	Jason raises his silver blade high.

				DALLAS
		No, we're playing a game...not you numbnuts...

	SLASH! The blade slices through Azrael's shoulder to the bottom of his 
	rib cage. Blood spurts
	as his right side pulls away from his body. Azrael does not seem hurt, 
	only pissed.

				AZRAEL
		Asshole that does not count as a kill.

				DALLAS
		Yes it does.

				AZRAEL
		Oh, come on!

	JASON is confused. He spins and slashed taking Dallas' head clean off. 
	The head falls to the ground, then Dallas speaks.

				DALLAS
		Okay, enough of this shit.

				AZRAEL
		Alright, asshole.

	The sound of an ENGINE SHUTTING DOWN.

	Jason finds himself standing alone on a huge open court, all white, 
	sterile.

	No creatures, no Dallas or Azrael. A both ends of the white garganuan 
	room we see a small tinted glass.

	Azrael's voice booms over a loud speaker.

				AZRAEL(V.O.)
		Clear off the court, asshole.

	INT.  BOOTH ONE

	Azrael sits before a huge console wearing a virtual reality suit.

	INT.  BOOTH TWO

	Dallas is in his own suit from the opposite booth.

				DALLAS
		I don't have all day, kid.

				AZRAEL
		Yeah yeah I better call the labs,
		see what the hell is going on.

	Jason stares at the tinted glass of Azrael's booth.

				AZRAEL
			(into mike)
		Lab...this is AZ in the game grid.
		Your guy got out and runined our game.

	INTERCUT AS NECESSARY:

	INT   LAB TWO

	The reaction to the broadcast.

				YLLO
		Azrael can you repeat that?

				RIZZO
		Get him out of there!

				AZRAEL
			(into mike)
		I said the guy in the mask is in here
		ruining our game.

	Jason starts to close in on Azrael's pod.

				AZRAEL
			(continuing)
		Send someone to the grid to pick
		him up. He looks lost.

				YLLO
		That's impossible.

				RIZZO
		I told you! Get them out of there!
			(grabs mike)
		Get out of there! Get out of there now!

				AZRAEL
			(into mike)
		All right fine, we'll head back--

	Suddenly, JASON shoves his fist through the glass.

				DALLAS
		Jesus!

	The sounds of Azrael's DEATH broadcast over the lab.

	When Jason retrieves his hand, he holds a bloody mass of Azrael's 
	insides.

	IN THE LAB, Brodski takes charge.

				BRODSKI
		Dallas! That you? Come back!

				DALLAS
			(into mike)
		Sarge! Get the fuck down here!
		We got a real shitstorm in the --

	DALLAS fights to get out of his virtual reality suit and get himself 
	into combat mode...BUT...

	JASON hears the movement. Turns, flings his silver blade.

	It flies across the room, throught the glass and impales Dallas' throat 
	to his chair.

	The blade shrots out the electronics in the grid and plunges the room to 
	black.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	As the connection goes to static.

				BRODSKI
			(into mike)
		Dallas?! Dallas?! Do you copy?

	Nothing. Finally...

				RIZZO
		He's dead. They're both dead. You
		don't understand what is on this ship.
		This is a being that kills. That's what
		he does. That's all he does. And he is very
		good at it.

				BRODSKI
		Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell
		me what the hell is going on!

	She gets up and heads for the door.

				DELONGPRE
		Where are you going?

				RIZZO
		We have to get off this ship.

	Yllo who has been losing control takes on the lead again.

				YLLO
		That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.

				RIZZO
		Why don't you get it? He's going to kill
		us all!

				BRODSKI
		I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever
		your ancient hockey player can throw at us.

				RIZZO
		Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship...
		and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the
		only way you're going to live.

				DELONGPRE
		You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future.
		We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of
		the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more
		advanced than what you're used to.

				RIZZO
		I hope so.

	EXT.  GAME GRID CORRIDOR

	Sven and Kicker approach the door. Casually, weapons slung low. The 
	doors hiss open, the black maw of the game grid on the other side.

				KICKER
		Damn. Are they playing?

				SVEN
		Dallas?! Azrael!

	Their combat sense perks up a bit. Something's not right. They turn on 
	their lights and ready their weapons.

	INT.  GAME GRID

	WIDE:  Hard beams of light search for anything.

	Sven, as his beam hits Azrael's pod.

				SVEN
		Oh shit.

	From inside pod as Sven and Kicker approach. THe blood splattered inside
	 the glass glows in the throws of their lights.

	Kicker breaks off to inspect the other POD Sven tries to hold down his 
	lunch.

				SVEN
		Sarge, this is bad. The kid's
		His guts are ripped out.

				BRODSKI
			(over radio)
		Dead?

				SVEN
		Oh yeah.

	Kicker reaches the other POD. the darkness looms behind him as he finds
	his friend.
				KICKER
			(into radio)
		Sarge, this is Kicker. Dallas got
		it to. Real slice and dice. What
		should we do?

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Everyone is in shock except Brodski...he's a pro.

				BRODSKI
		Report to weapons. We're going
		on a hunt.

	KICKER IN THE GRID

				KICKER
		Roger that.
			(to himself)
		Time to kick some ass!

	From behind him a shape materializes. A hand reaches out of the 
	darkness.

	KICKER JUMPS! Spins around with his weapon at the ready!

	IT'S SVEN!

				SVEN
		Sorry!

				KICKER
		Don't friggen do that!

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Brodski is in assault mode.

				BRODSKI
		Yllo, what's your head count?

				YLLO
		Looks like we're missing two.
		Stone and Kkinsa.

				JANESSA
		You know, Stoney's done everyone
		on this trip but me..what's up with that?

	Brodski scans the room - a tactical assessment.

				BRODSKI
		This place should be safe. Get them
		back here. I don't want to be hunting
		around and kill one of your kids by accident.
		As much as I've dreamed of doing that.

	Brodski goes to Rizzo while Yllo buzzes Stoney's cabin.

				BRODSKI
		I need to know what you know about this guy.

				RIZZO
		Don't go out there. You can't win.
		We need to get off this ship. That's
		all there is to it.

				BRODSKI
		Not an option. I'm going to hunt this
		son of a bitch down.

	Rizzo shakes her head. She can't get through to this guy.

				BRODSKI
		I've been a grunt for fifteen years.
		There's not a problem I can't fix with
		enough ammunition.

	Yllo is getting no response.

				YLLO
		Stoney! Stoney if you can hear me,
		get your ass down to the lab immediately!
			(beat)
		I'm going to see if I can find them.

	Yllo opens the door and Kkinsa is there! Half-naked, covered in blood. 
	Janessa SCREAMS and the others gasp.

	Kkinsa falls to the floor..whimpering, in shock. Boeman rushes over
	to her with a blanket.

				KKINSA
		Sstoney's dead!

	They all look to each other, searching for what to say or do...Rizzo 
	puts her head in her hands...not again.

	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Brodski double-checks his sidearm as Yllo follows him down the hall.

				YLLO
		ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab,
		couple of hours no more. Let them take a
		look at our friends.

				BRODSKI
		Not a chance.

				YLLO
		JUst don't go in there half cocked.
		You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and
		ask questions later.

				BRODSKI
		You got that right.

	They arrive at the door of the WEAPONS ROOM.

				YLLO
		This thing could be worth a great deal....
		scientifically...not to mention what the fat cats
		on Earth II would pay for it! Look, I'll split it with
		you 50/50...

	The door opens. The E-X Grunts are all there. Weapons in a rack on one 
	wall. They are in various states of battle dresss. Yllo follows Brodski in. 
	Brodski turns and faces him, his men behind.

				BRODSKI
		You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch!
		If that...that thing is out there, it's
		dead! You got it!!!

				KICKER
		Fuckin A...

				BRODSKI
		Now get out of our way...get back to the
		lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats...
		we've got a job to do!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo enters pissed off. The others are standing around not sure what to 
	do.

				YLLO
		That bastard! Boemen turn on the
		tracking monitors.

	Rizzo walks over to Kay-em 14. Thorgon is working on her.

				RIZZO
		Robot huh?

				KAY-EM 14
		Kay-em 14.

				RIZZO
		Barbie from hell...

				KAY-EM 14
		Cybernetics science droid,
		fluent in over six...

				RIZZO
		Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS,
		now how about you help me get
		out of this coffin, Barbie...

				KAY-EM 14
		I'm afraid I cannot assist.

	Rizzo is very frustrated.

				RIZZO
		I'm surrounded by idiots.

				KAY-EM 14
		You need to get laid!

	Thorgon looks up from his work.

				THORGON
		Sorry, I'm working on it.

				DELONGPRE
		Are all twenty-first century girls like you?

				RIZZO
		He'll kill us all. You know that, don't you?

	AN ALARM SOUNDS.

				THORGON
			(re:monitor)
		There's been an unauthorized entrance to the
		Cargo Bay.

				BRODSKI
		Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to
		Lab two and cover out backs.

			(into the mic)
		At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?

				BRODSKI (v.o.)
		I'll try.

								CUT TO:
	INT. CARGO DOOR - MIDSHIP

	kicker, sven, CONDOR, BRIGGS, and GEKO are locked and loaded. Dressed in 
	full armor,
	packing massive high tech weaponry, they are a sight to see. Jason may 
	have met his
	match.

				BRODSKI
		Alright, the teach requests we take this guy
		out at the knees. I say shoot to kill.

	The boys fidget with excitment. Bout time they see some action.

				BRODSKI
		So after you've killed him, put one in his knee
		so we can say we tried.

	The men LAUGH and high five.

				BRODSKI
		Go to infrared, stay in radio contact.
			(into headset)
		Teach you there?

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo walks in and sits at a bank of monitors. Through one, we see the 
	team standing at the cargo doors.

				YLLO
		Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		You just keep an eye out.

				YLLO
		Yeah yeah. Got it.

	Yllo removes his head set and quickly turns to a separate console. He 
	has his own agenda.

	INT.  CARGO DOOR - MIDSHIP

				BRODSKI
		Let's move out.

	The doors HISS open.

	INT. CARGO BAY

	A massive room. Boxes stacked hihg, some to the ceilin,g creating a 
	maze.

				BRODSKI
		Two teams, Port, starboard.

	They split up.

	INT. LAB ONE

	The kids are standing at a schematic of the ship. Several small blips 
	are entering the cargo area.

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Kicker, anything?

				KICKER(V.O.)
		Negative.

	Rizzo stands over Thorgan to see the monitor.

				THORGAN
		Each blip represents a trained killer.
		It's men like that fought off the pirates
		on Earth II, battled Jauntuns on the solar 
		moons...

	For the moment, Rizzo looks distantly hopeful.

				RIZZO
		So, you're saying thse guys have like,
		lasers and stuff? They could hack him
		to pieces?

				THORGAN
		Exactly.

	INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

	Briggs and Geko move side by side. Condor brings up the rear. Suddenly 
	he is jerked out
	of view. 

	CLOSE ON CONDOR'S FACE, jason's hand around his throat. SNAP. The eyes 
	go dead, the neck broken.

	INT. LAB ONE

	Rizzo sees something. Her hopes fade.

				RIZZO
		WHAT'S IT MEAN WHEN ONE OF YOUR BLIPS 
	DISAPPEARS?

	All eyes turn to the schematic as one of the blips FLICKERS and FADES.

				KAY-EM 14
		E-x Grunt Condor has flatlined.

				BOEMAN
			(into mic)
		Sergeant, this is Boemen...

	INT.  CARGO BAY - STARBOARD

	Sergeant Brodski stops.

	INT. CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

				BRIGGS
		Got it.

	BRIGGS and GEKO split up, moving around a large metallic tank.

	BRIGGS INFARED POV

	Gun ready, he moves around the crated fuselage slowly.

				BRIGGS
		I don't see anything.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	The blip flashes again.

	INFARRED POV reveal GEKO moving toward him.

				BRIGGS
		That's GEKO. mAYBE you kids should

	onto his silver blade.

	BRIGGS fires...screams.

	Rizzo is cowering on the floor, her hands over her ears. She's sweating, 
	convulsing.

				BOEMAN
		Sergeant, you've lost two more men!

	INT. CARGO BAy - PORTSIDE

	Brodski and his remaining men double-time-it to the slaughter. Briggs 
	and Geko lie dEAD
	AT THEIR FEET.

				KICKER
		Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?

				BRODSKI
		Teach! Where the hell are you?!
		Where's our visuals?!!

	INT. LAB TWO

	Yllo is talking on  aseparate mike. Unwaakre of the slaughteri n the 
	next room.

				YLLO
		Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the
		Solaras Space Lab.

				FAT LOU(V.O.)
		I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.

				YLLO
		We've got a situation here! Just do
		as  you're told!

				FAT LOU(V.O.)
		Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon
		as we've passed Tara's rings we'll
		make the course correction.

	BACK TO YLLO.

				YLLO
		Thank you.

	Yllo disconnects, and turns to the other console.

				YLLO
			(into mic)
		Ok Sarge, what's your status?

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three
		men and your worthless fuck! After I 
		kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!

				YLLO
		But I didn't see...

	INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

	GUNFIRE ERUPTS!

				SVEN(V.O.)
		I got him! I got him!

	INT. LAB ONE

	CHEERS from everyone except Rizzo who knows better. She shakes her head.

				THORGAN
		Yes!

				RIZZO
		Listen up duck fuckers, you can't
		kill this thing.

				BOEMAN
		Duck fuckers?

				RIZZO
		He's either unconcious or playing dead,
		whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay,
		you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.

				DELONGPRE
		Outta here?

				RIZZO
		Isn't there an escape POD on this ship?
		Something?

				THORGON
		There's a shuttle.

				RIZZO
		Alright, been nice knowing you.
		Who's with me?

				KKINSA
		I'll go.

				BOEMEN
		Yllo said stay here.

				KKINSA
		Fuck Yllo!

				BOEMEN
		They got him! You're not leaving!

	INT. CARGO BAY - MIDSHIP

	Sven is kneeling over Jason's body. 

				SVEN
		Big sucker too.

	Suddenly, Jason reaches up, grabs the back of Sven's head and SLAMS it 
	into his mask.
	Sven's forehead shatters.

	ON BRODSKI

	As he races around a crate. Sven's body is within sight. His killer 
	nowhere to be seen.

				BRODSKI
		Kicker? Where are you?

	Elsewhere we hear GUNFIRE followed closely by a SCREAM!

	ELSEWHERE

	Kicker crawls across the floor, blood spews from his mouth.

	PULL BACK TO RVEAL

	He's been split in half at the wait...his entrails dragging behind him..
	SHUNK! A machete throught the back of the neck puts him out of his 
	misery.

	INT. LAB ONE

				RIZZO
		Do something!!!

				THORGON
		Don't look at me! I'm in high school!

	INT. CARGO BAY

	Brodski runs. He's spooked. Twisting and turning in every direction.

				BRODSKI
		Find Crutch! Set up an ion field
		around the cargo bay. We'll torch
		the sucker! Yllo...you're a dead man!

	Brodski races toward the Cargo exit.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	ON MONITOR

	We see Brodski racing towards us. We also see Jason, lying in wait, 
	hidden by one 
	of the crates.

				YLLO
		Sergeant!

				BRODSKI
			(stops)
		What?

	Yllo considers then.
				YLLO
		Nothing.

	On the monitor we see Brodski move forward. He never saw Jason coming.
	BRODSKI SCREAMS.  Yllo turns his head.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	The kids stand in shock, silently staring at one another, listening to 
	the
	static of the dead communications. Boeman reaches over and clicks off 
	the radio.
	Silence.  Rizzo leaps to her feet.

				RIZZO
		Lesson number one, kiddies. You wanna
		get home safely then we get off this boat.

	Kkinsa starts t cry.

				KKINSA
		I don't understand...what does he want?

				RIZZO
		He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone
		on this ship.

	Rizzo looks at everyone.

				RIZZO
		Any questions?

	A side door HISSES OPEN. Yllo enters.

				YLLO
		You're not going anywhere.

				RIZZO
		You wanna die?

				YLLO
			(ignores her)
		Are we locked down?

				BOEMAN
		That door's the only way in or out and it
		won't open without the code.

				YLLO
		Then we wait. We're docking with Space Lab
		in less than an hour.

				RIZZO
		What good will that do?

				YLLO
		They can deal with this sort of thing.

				RIZZO
		More soldiers?

				YLLO
		Scientists. Very intellegent men.

				RIZZO
		That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's
		ass at a spelling bee!

				JANESSA
		Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out
		and let us handle this?

				YLLO
		Try to calm down. Just think, you're going
		to be famous!

				RIZZO
			(to kids)
		Guys, please come with me!

				YLLO
		4You're not going anywhere.

	Rizzo starts for the door but Yllo grabs her arms, holds them behind 
	her.

				DELONGPRE
		Now hold on! We should hear her out!

				THORGAN
		She's obviously dealt with this guy before.

				YLLO
		Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!

				DELONGPRE
		No shit. I got no problem with that.

	Janessa readies a hypo.

				THORGAN
		Maybe if we knew a little bit more about
		what we're delaing with here...

	Janessa moves behind Rizzo with the sedative.  Suddenly Rizzo throws her 
	head back, Salmming it into Yllo's nose. He CRIES OUT in pain.

	Janessa lunges with the syringe but Rizzo snatches her wrist, grabbing 
	the hypo, burying it into Janessa's left breast.

				RIZZO
		tNighty-night.

	Janessa collapses.  Yllo rushes Rizzo again, but this time Boeman 
	stands, blocks his path.

				CRUTCH
		Leave her be.

				RIZZO
		Ok, who do I gotta fuck to get off this boat?

	Thorgan timidly raises his hand.

				RIZZO
		Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship.
		Come with me.

				THORGAN
		Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space?
		We'll die oout there.

	Rizzo rushes the door. There's a code box on the wall.

				RIZZO
		How do you open the damn door?

				YLLO
		You're crazy!

	Kkinsa punches in the code. The door HISSES open.

				DELONGPRE
		Rizzo, he's out there.

				RIZZO
		Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.
			(looks at Delongpre)
		Last chance.

	The others stare at her. She's crazy.

				RIZZO
		Fine. Bye.

	She and Kkinsa exit, the door SWISHES CLOSED behind them.

				YLLO
			(favoring his nose)
		Pack your shit. We'll disembark in an hour.
		The guys at Space Lab have the necessary
		equipment to contain this thing and then we
		can study it.

	But the kids aren't so sure.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Yllo enters, makes sure he wasn't followed then approaches a console.

				YLLO
		Computer on line.

	A series of beeps.

				JANESSA(O.S.)
		What are you doing?

				YLLO
			(jumps)
		Jesus! Can't you knock?
			(back to console)
		Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Power to Beowulf disengaged.

				YLLO
			(to Janessa)
		She's too valuable. She's not leaving this ship.

								CUT TO:

	INT. GRENDEL BRIDGE

	Fat Lou and Bernie prepare for course corrections.

				FAT LOU
		Disengage auto-pilot.

				BERNIE
		Disengaged.

				FAT LOU
		New COURSE, seven-eighty-one.

	EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

	She banks slowly to the right.

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

				BERNIE
		On course. ETA 36 minutes, 34 seconds.

				FAT LOU
		Engage auto pilot.

	Suddenly, Bernie is ripped from his chair! Electricity SHOOTS through  
	the console
	as Bernie's DIALOG becomes jibberish.

				BERNIE
		En-en-en-en...Eta-Eta...

	Fat Lou stares up in shock just before JASON SLAMS Bernie's torso ontop 
	of her.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	FAT LOU'S upper body has disappeared. In other words, Bernie now has 
	legs.
	Little good they'll do him.

	THROUGH WINDSHIELD.

	Far in the distance we see a tiny space station -- SPACE LAB.
	A monitor reads ...

	SPACE LAB ETA 00:35:59 and counting.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Rizzon and Kkinsa enter.

				RIZZO
		Which way?

	Kkinsa points. They head in that direction. Then Rizzo suddenly stops.

				KKINSA
		What?

				RIZZO
		Ssh.

	Rizzo pulls Kkinsa close to one of the crates.

				RIZZO
		He's in here.

	Kkinsa opens her mouth to scream. Rizzo slaps her hand over Kkinsa's 
	mouth.

				RIZZO
		You scream I'll snap your neck.
		Got it?

	Kkinsa nods. Rizzo releases her.

				KKINSA
			(whispers)
		How do you know?

				RIZZO
			(dread)
		I just know.

	INT.  LAB ONE 

	The crew has packed their essentials and now wait to dock with Space 
	Lab. Yll is standing
	before the others holding Jason's machete.

				YLLO
		We must assume the machete was an
		intricate part of the game of hockey.

				DELONGPRE
		I'm thinking Rizzo was right.

				YLLO
		Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?

				DELONGPRE
		Maybe we should go with them. Like you said,
		your Space Lab connections can deal with this 
	thing.
		At least we'll be safe.

				YLLO
		They are not going anywhere. I cut power to
		the  shuttle.

	The kids and Crutch stare at him. Cold hearted.

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Rizzo and Kkinsa approach. 

				RIZZO
		Open the doors.

	Kkinsa punches in a series of buttons. Nothing.

				KKINSA
		Something's wrong.

				RIZZO
		Keep trying!

	INT.  LAB ONE

				YLLO
		Everyone ready?

	Yllo grabs a mike from a console.

				YLLO
		Fat Lou, what's the ETA?

	STATIC.

				YLLO
		Lou, goddamjnit! Bernie, where's Lou?!

	STATIC.

	Boeman moves to one of the consoles, clicks a few buttons.

	ON MONITOR

	We see the view from the bridge security camera. Lots of blood and the 
	mangled combination of Lou and Bernie.

				THORGAN
		Yuck.

				DELONGPRE
		We're screwed.

				YLLO
		The ship doesn't need pilots to dock.
		We'll disembark and you'll see.
		Everything will be fine.

				BOEMAN
		Uh...that's gonna be a problem.
		The ship's not on auto-pilot.
		We're flying blind.
			(a beat)
		Thirty minutes till impact.

	All eyes turn to Yllo, for guidance, his back to the outer door.

				YLLO
		I guess...we'll have to go to the bridge.

				THORGAN
		But...

	Jason is out there. Then --

	WHAM-WHAM-WHAM!

	The outer door bucks and dents! Everyone jumps!

	WHAM-WHAM-WHAM!

								QUICK-CUT TO:

	INT. SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Over the headsets, Rizzo and Kkinsa hear the SCREAMS.

				RIZZO
		Damnit, he's got them.

	Kkinsa keeps trying the code box. Nothing.

				KKINSA
		Rizzo, I think Yllo must have done
		something. The door won't open.

	INT.  LAB ONE

				YLLO
		It's alright. He can't get in here!

	WHAM! WHAM!!! But the door is starting to give.

	Through the confusion, Crutch moves to one of the consoles. Clicks
	away at the keyboard.

	INT.   SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	The shuttle hums to life.

				KKINSA
		The power's back up!

				RIZZO
		Then open the doors!

				KKINSA
		Thirty seconds.

	INT.   LAB ONE

	WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!

				JANESSA
		What do we do?!!

				YLLO
		Crutch?

				CRUTCH
		Help me up.

	Boeman helps Crutch to the top of a table. Crutch goes to work on a  
	ceiling
	vent, removing screws.

				JANESSA
		Okay, I'm guessing you should hurry.

	The top corner of the door bends...Jason peers through.

				THORGAN
		Jesus, tell this asshole I don't
		play hockey!

				CRUTCH
		Okay!

	Our group starts climbing the table and into the ceiling space.

				YLLO
		Will that take us to the bridge?

				CRUTCH
		It's a maze up there, but yes.

				YLLO
		We'll engage auto-pilot!
		Everything'll be fine!

	With that, the door gives!

	Boeman heaves Crutch into the crawl space then follows himself.  Jason 
	pauses,
	staring at Kay-Em --

				KAY-EM 14
		Heart beat irregular...no blood flow...
		impossible...this....this... does not
		make sense.

	Jason's heard enough. He swings his cleaver, but Kay-Em ducks. Turns and 
	leaps
	through the hole in the celing.

	INT.  CEILING WALK SPACE

	Yllo grips the ledge.

				YLLO
		Move it people!

	Then Yllo screams. Jason has him from below. Boeman grabs his arms.

				BOEMAN
		Help me!

	DeLongpre grabs hold and pulls. Suddenly Yllo is jerked out of their
	grasp. They fall onto their backs breathing heavily.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo leaps to his feet. Jason looms over him.

				YLLO
		Now hold on! Have you considered
		how valuable you are? Credit, fame,
		you can have it all. And ladies. I 
		mean, how long has it been?

	Jason stands there, but his attention isn't on Yllo. It's on the machete 
	sticking through
	Yllo's belt. Jason reaches for it. Yllo backs into a wall.

	Jason slowly removes the machete from Yllo's belt and stares at it. He 
	drops
	the cleaver to the ground.

				YLLO
			(chuckles)
		That's all you wanted?

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	The shuttle doors slide open as we hear over the headset --

				YLLO(V.O.)
		It's okay, he just wanted his machete.

				RIZZO
			(knowingly)
		Three...two...one...

	Yllo screams.

	INT.  CEILING WALK SPACE

	Yllo's SCREAMS turn to GURGLES. All eyes stare at the opening in the 
	walkway, then --

	YLLO'S HEAD LANDS IN BOEMAN'S LAP!

				KAY-EM 14
		Now that's just gross.

	JASON STICKS HIS HEAD THROUGH.  EVERYONE JUMPS, SCREAMS.

				DELONGPRE
		GO, GO, GO!

	They race down the walkway, over huge pipes and through electrical 
	wires, Crutch 
	in the lead.

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Kkinsa enters the shuttle, turns to Rizzo.

				KKINSA
		Rizzo, come on!

	But, Rizzo hesitates. We can still hear the PANICKED SCREAMS over the 
	headset.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Go-go-go-go-go!!!!

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		He's right behind us!

				RIZZO
		Damn!
			(to Kkinsa)
		Close the door! I'll be right back.

				KKINSA
			(panicked)
		What?!!

				RIZZO
		I gotta go back.

				KKINSA
		But?!!

	Rizzo turns and races through the maze of boxes and crates leaving 
	Kkinsa nearly
	insane.

	INT.  CELING WALK SPACE

				KAY-EM 14
		I'm quite sure I wasn't designed for this.

	Crutch comes to a fork in the walkway.

				CRUTCH
		Okay, we need to ...

				BOEMAN
		You forgot didn't you, you old
		fart?

	At the back of the line, Delongpre turns as Jason rounds the bend behind 
	him.

				DELONGPRE
		Shit! Move it! He's coming!

	Delongpre leaps forward creating a pile out of Janessa and Thorgan

				DELONGPRE
		Go!

	Racing forward the group stays just out of Jason's grasp. Leaping
	over and under and through whatever blocks the path.

				DELONGPRE
		Faster!

	Jason swings his machete at DeLongpre! It just misses him.

				DELONGPRE
		FASTER!!!

	Crutch comes to ascreened panel. Boeman kicks it open.
	They leap down onto a catwalk crossing the --

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	They are twenty feet off the ground as --

	Rizzo stops, stares straight up.

	HER POV

	the group races across the catwalk as Json leaps down behind them.

				DELONGPRE
		He's right on my ass!

	Then Jason grabs Delongpre, who screams.

	RIZZO,

	spots a gun left by one of the marines. She snatches it, points it 
	towards
	Jason and Delongpre then aims a little high.

	FZZZT!

	It slices through a metal cord holding the catwalk to the ceiling.

	The catwalk jerks. Everyone tumbles. Jason loses his grip on Delongpre.

	Suddenly, METAL SCREECHES, as the catwalk gives under the weight. It 
	RIPS in half,dumping both
	heroes and Jason.

	RIZZO dives out of the way as a pile of metal and bodies crash to the 
	ground!

	Janessa sits up rubbing her head.

				JANESSA
		That was fun.

	Kay-Em 14 sits up, sings.

				KAY-EM 14
		I got a brand new pair of
		roller-skates, you got a brand new key...

				JANESSA
		Thorgan?!

				THORGAN
		I didn't do it. The fall scattered her
		programming..wait. Where's? Shit!

	He's lying on top of Jason. He scrambles to his feet. But Jason doesn't 
	move.

				THORGAN
		Hey, I think the fall killed him.

	The group slowly gathers around. Jason sits up and swings at Thorgan. 
	Boeman pulls him out of
	the way just in time.

	Jason starts to stand when RIZZO comes up behind him.

	KA-FWAM! She brings the barrel of a high tech gun down on the top of 
	Jason's head.
	He collapses. The surrounded faces look happily suprised.

				RIZZO
		Trust me, it's temporary.

	Boeman takes the gun from Rizzo.

				BOEMAN
		Better let me.

				THORGAN
		Where'd you get the gun?

	Rizzo gestures at what's left of Geko's body.

				CRUTCH
		The bridge is this way!

	They take off running.

				RIZZO
		Wait!

	Everyone stops, turns --

				KAY-EM 14
		There's not enough time.

	Rizzo catches up.

				RIZZO
		Forget the bridge, the shuttle's
		waiting!

				BOEMAN
			(to Kay-Em)
		What do you mean, not enough time?

				KAY-EM 14
			(switches voice)
		You know what you get if you shove
		two bananas up your ass? Two shit covered
		bananas.

				JANESSA
		I think your metal lover's losing it.

				KAY-EM 14
			(normal voice)
		Impact in ten minutes. It will take 
		fifteen to reach the bridge.
			(switches voices, sings)
		Mamma's little baby love shortnin,
		shortnin, mamma's little baby love 
		shotnin bread...

				DELONGPRE
		Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.

				RIZZO
		Guys!!! The shuttle?

	The kids look at one another as if this were a stroke of genius.

				RIZZO
		Idiots.

				CRUTCH
		This way!

	Crutch again leads them through the maze. Delongpre stops at
	another Grunt body, removes a chain gun. THorgan takes a high
	tech laser from another.

				THORGAN
		I feel better. Now how do you
		fire this damn thing?

				DELONGPRE
		Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!

				CRUTCH
			(jokingly)
		Just around this bend...

	Jason steps out in front of Crutch, his machete held poised in front of 
	him.
	Crutch runs right up onto the blade.

				BOEMAN
		Nooooo!

	Alrhoguh he's meat on a stick, Crutch doesn't give up. He SLAMS his 
	fists into
	Jason's torso.

	Thorgan turns to fire --Boeman KNOCKS the barrel high.

				BOEMAN
		You'll hit crutch!

	Boeman tosses his weapon to Janessa and leaps on Jason's back, locking 
	his arms 
	around his neck.

				RIZZO
		What are you doing? You can't save him!

	Delongpre smashes the back of Jason's knee with the chaingun.
	Jason topples on top of Boeman. Crutch is thrown free.

	Janessa and Thorgan help Crutch to his feet as Jason sees Rizzo for the
	first time in 400 hundred years.

	It's either love at first sight or one hell of a grudge. He leaps to his
	feet and races towards her.

				RIZZO
		Don't just stand there! Shoot him!

				DELONGPRE
			(to Jason)
		No you don't!

	BRAAAAAAATTTT!

	The chaingun dances Jason backwards. He CRASHES through the side of one 
	of the 
	cargo boxes. EVERYONE STOPS.

				RIZZO
		Don't stop!

	She jerks the gun from Delongpre and races to the crate.

				RIZZO
		You never stop when he's down!

	But the crate is empty.

				RIZZO
		Shit!!!!

	They spin around, searching.

				CRUTCH
			(weak)
		Forget him. Come on.

	Carrying Crutch, they move toward the shuttle bay.

	panel, clicks some buttons, then --

				BOEMAN
		Uh-oh.

				JANESSA
		What?!

				BOEMAN
		Kkinsa! Open the doors!

	INT. SHUTTLE COCKPIT


	Kkinsa sits in the pilot's seat. She's terrified.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Kkinsa! He's coming! Open the doors!

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	DeLongpre shoves Boeman out of the way.

				DELONGPRE
		Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!

				RIZZO
		Yeah, that's it, scare the hell
		out of here, that'll work.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

				RIZZO(V.O.)
			(calming)
		Kkinsa, it's me, Rizzo. He's not
		out here right now, so please let us in.

	Kkinsa doesn't move.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to
		the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

				DELONGPRE
		Med-kit?

				RIZZO
		I guessed.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

	Kkinsa considers. She reaches for a button marked SHUTTLE 
	DOORS...hesitates.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		We're going to be okay, Kkinsa.
		Just relax.

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Kay-Em 14 steps forward.

				KAY-EM 14
		Allow me. I'm trained in all aspects
		of the human psyche.

	Rizzo backs away -- as Kay-Em nears the mike ...

				KAY-EM 14
		Kkinsa, dear, it is I, KAY-EM 14...
		open the fucking door you silly bitch!

	Rizzo shoves Kay-Em out of the way.

				KAY-EM 14
		I didn't say I was good at it.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Oh shit! There he is!

	INT.  CARGO BAY SHUTTLE

	Jason is standing at the entrance to the Cargo Shuttle Bay.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

	Kkinsa leans forward and presses --

	LAUNCH.

	INT.   CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	The Shuttle ROARS to life and begins pulling away from the ship.

				BOEMAN
		Kkinsa! No!!!

	EXT.   GRENDEL CLASS IV

	The shuttle moves slowly away from the docking position.

	INT.   CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	Rizzo opens fire! Thorgan and Delongpre join in.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As boxes and cargo shatter under the heaby fire. Smoke rises. It's 
	impossible
	to see where Jason is. RIZZO stops FIRING.

				RIZZO
		DON'T WASTE YOUR AMMO!

	But, they don't let up. Boxes explode, crates collapse until -- 
	Thorgan's gun clicks empty.
	Then Delongpre's.

	SILENCE.

	The smoke slowly clears revealing the rubble.

				THORGAN
		Did we get him?

	Suddenly, Jason again steps into the Cargo entrance.

				DELONGPRE
		We're screwed!

				RIZZO
		400 years in the future and these
		pea-shooters are the best you can do?!

	They are trapped. Jason blocks the only exit. He slowly moves towards 
	them.

				RIZZO
		Just make a break for the door.
		He'll get some of us, but that's the
		breaks.

				BOEMAN
		We're not leaving Crutch!

				RIZZO
		We don't have time to argue!

	But Jason has locked in on Rizzo. He moves towards her.

				JANESSA
		Okay, tell you what. You die, we'll run.

	Rizzo and the others back into a corner. Jason has them. There's nothing 
	they
	can do.

	Rizzo holds the gun steady, waiting for point blank range. 

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

	THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

	SPACE LAB, which was only a dot the last time we saw it, suddenly looms 
	toward us.

	The left side of Grendel SMASHES into the side of Space Lab!

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	Suddenly everything shifts toward the bridge. Boxes, cargo, kids, and 
	Jason!

	EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

	Grendel SLIDES along SPACE LAB, ripping huge chunks of metal from both.
	SPARK fly. There are interior EXPLOSIONS on Space Lab, then --

	KA-FOOM!

	Space Lab EXPLODES!

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	The entire ship shifts upwards. Cargo, crew, and Jason fly into the air.

	ELECTRICAL fires sprout up all over. Cargo boxes SHATTER, contents 
	SPILLING.

	RIZZO loses her gun.

	EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

	Debris from Space Lab TEARS into the side of the ship and beyond.

	EXT.  SHUTTLE

	One huge chunk heads right towards the Shuttle.

	INT.  SHUTTLE

	Kkinsa stares out the window as the huge chunk flies toward her.

	EXT.  SHUTTLE 

	IMPACT! THE SHUTTLE IMPLODES! ONE BRIGHT RED FIREBALL.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Everything piled and in tatters. Our heroes slowly regain their 
	bearings.

				BOEMAN
		Everyone okay?

				THORGAN
		I think I broke my arm.

				KAY-EM 14
		I seem to have misplaced mine.

	Kay-Em 14's right arm is missing, wires sticking out of the stump.

				JANESSA
		You geeks wanna gimmie a hand?

	Janessa is buried beneath a pile of rubble. Boeman helps her to her 
	feet.

				DELONGPRE
			(quiet)
		We lost crutch.

	Rizzo stands and watches as the other sgather around Crutch's body.
	It's battered and twisted all out of place. Boeman falls next to the 
	body.

				BOEMAN
		Goodbye old friend.

				RIZZO
		Okay, he was a great guy, now
		let's move out.

				BOEMAN
			(snaps)
		Could you show a little compassion?!

	Rizzo stares at Boeman.

				RIZZO
		Look, I'm sorry. I really am, but aren't you
		forgetting about ...

	SUDDENLY a pile of rubble EXPLODES.

	Jason rises, his back to them.

				DELONGPRE
		Back to the labs!

	But Jason has other plans. Seemingly unfazed by the past events he 
	rushes after them.

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Dam-damage port side 59 percent.
		Decompression 40 percent. Gravity-y rotors
		failing.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Our kids race toward the door, Jason right behind them --

	Thorgan slams the door panel with his good arm. SPARKS fly.
	The door won't open.

				THORGAN
		Oh shit.

	They turn as Jason looms toward them, then --

	EVERYTHING STARTS TO FLOAT

	Cargo and debris. Our heroes. Jason.

	The loss of gravity and Jason's steamrollering momentum SLAMS him into 
	the 
	cargo doors, BREAKING them open and sending him tumbling backwards.

				JANESSA
		This is just great.

				KAY-EM 14
		Engage magnetics.

	Kay-Em 14's left hand magnetically locks to the Cargo frame a

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jason grabs Rizzo's ankle. Boeman, floating close, punches Jason in the 
	back of the head.

	Still holding Rizzo's ankle, Jason topples, spinning the two out of 
	frame.

	The force of the punch sends Boeman in the opposite direction.

				THORGAN
		This is crazy, we can't do anything like this!

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Rizzo KICKS Jason in the top of the head, sending him SLAMMING into the 
	ceiling.

	A SEVERED ARM

	floats past DeLongpre. There's a chain gun still clutched by the  hand.
	Delongpre grabs both and turns the gun on Jason.

	BRAAATTTT...

	Jason is sent further back, but the force of the chaingun SLAMS 
	Delongpre into a back wall.
	He's knocked unconcious.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As Thorgan manages to grab Kay-Em 14 around the neck.

				THORGAN
		Grab my hand!

	Janessa takes his hand and in turn reaches out and snags the unconcious 
	dELONGPRE'S FOOT.

				JANESSA
		Boeman, can you reach DeLongpre?
		We'll push you in.

	CARGO - MIDSHIP

	Jason is floating toward the other end of the Cargo Bay,
	unable to stop himself.

	BOEMAN

	reaches for DeLongpre. Inches away. Finally he grabs Delongpre by the 
	locks of his
	hair, pulls himself closer.

				DELONGPRE
		Hey! That hurts.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Rizzo is floatin g up near the ceiling. She manages to grab hold of a 
	hanging piece of
	busted catwalk.

				DELONGPRE
			(to Rizzo)
		Push off toward us.

				JANESSA
		Forget her, she's a pain in the ass.
		Let her hang there.

	Crutch's body floats into our heroes, his intestines spilling from his 
	open gut,
	tangling around our heroes.

				THORGAN
		I'm gonna spew.

				JANESSA
		That ought'a help the situation.

				DELONGPRE
		Do it Rizzo! We'll catch you.

	RIZZO'S POV

	Rizzo stares at the human rope that consists of Thorgan, Janessa, 
	Boeman, and Delongpre.

				RIZZO
		What if you miss?

				DELONGPRE
		What if we don't?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	AS JASON steadies himself against a wall, focuses in one Rizzo, then 
	pushes off with his feet.

	HE ROCKETS toward her!

				DELONGPRE
		He's coming right at you!

	Rizzo spots Jason and pushes off! But her aim was HURRIED...
	and bad. She's gonna miss them.

	Boeman flips in the air!

				BOEMAN
			(to Delongpre)
		Grab my feet!

	Delongpre does and Boeman reaches out and snags Rizzo. The momentum 
	spins the human
	chain into a near wall --KAFWAM-- nearly breaking it apart.

				JANESSA
		Okay that hurt.

				BOEMAN
		Thorgan, pull us in.

	Jason SLAMS into the ceiling, then careens off of the wall --

	As Thorgan pulls the group out of the Cargo bay.

				THORGAN
		What now?

	They watch as Jason grabs a hold of the walkway.

				JANESSA
		Shit. He's gonna send himself right at us.

	Jason takes aim.

								QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

				COMPUTER VOICE
		System repair activated. Back up power on line.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Jason again ROCKETS THROUGH THE AIR -- when

	GRAVITY IS RESTORED.

	He drops to the cargo floor like a rock! Falling cargo -- huge crates, 
	gargantuan machines,
	a forklift -- buries him.

	Our heroes tumble to the ground.

				JANESSA
			(to Rizzo)
		Get off of me!

	They stand slowly, eyeing the rubble.

				THORGAN
			(rubbing his arm)
		You think it killed . . .
			(off Rizzo's stare)
		Yeah, I guess not.

				JANESSA
		Let's just get out of here.

				BOEMAN
		The ship's in bad shape. Back to
		the labs. Let's check out status.

	INT. SHIP CORRIDORS

	Our group makes their way back toward the labs.

	ELECTRICAL fires are everywhere. Systems are shorting out all over the 
	ship.

	INT. LAB ONE

	Rizzo, in the lead, enters the lab, when the ship BUCKS and QUAKES! A 
	portion of the hall
	collapses behind her.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	Boeman and the others dive back out of the way.

				BOEMAN
		Shit!

				THORGAN
		The hull's imploding!

				BOEMAN
		Rizzo! Can you hear me?!

	INT.  LAB ONE

				RIZZO
		Yeah. Are you guys okay?

	Boeman peers through a crack in the collapsed hull.

				BOEMAN
		There's a red lever on the wall
		beside you. Pull it!

	Rizzo turns, spots the red lever. EMERGENCY PRESSURIZATION STABILIZER.
	It's bolted.

				RIZZO
		It's locked!

				BOEMAN
		Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's
		going to depressurize!

	Rizzo kicsk the metal leg from a table. BASHES the bolt with it, until 
	it breaks.

				BOEMAN
		Hurry Rizzo! You have to reverse
		the pressurization.

	She grabs the lever...then hesitates. Backs away.

				BOEMAN
		What are you doing?!!

				RIZZO
		If the ship goes, so does Jaso.

				BOEMAN
		Rizzo pull the fucking lever!

				RIZZO
		No.

				DELONGPRE
		Rizzo?!

				RIZZO
		It's better this way. If we were rescued
		Jason would just get off the ship. You want
		him on your precious Earth II?

	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Boeman and the other start tearing the debris out of the way!

				THORGAN
		Hurry! She's lost it!

				JANESSA
		So what else is new?

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Boeman climbs through a hole in the rubble. He grabs the lever.

				RIZZO
		Boeman don't. You know I'm right.

				JANESSA
		Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!

	Boeman yanks the lever.

	As the others climb into the lab --

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Depressurization inconclusive.

				KAY-EM 14
		We've lost too much pressure. An hour, tops.

				JANESSA
			(to Rizzo)
		You happy? You've killed us all!

	Thorgan rushes over to the big Nano-tech machine. Places his broken arm 
	on the slab.
	The machine quickly goes to work.

	A schematic of his arm appears on the wall.

	Janessa stares at him.

				JANESSA
		What's the point?

	Delongpre shrugs.

				DELONGPRE
		So that's it then.

	It seems it is.

	Janessa stands over Yllo's decapitated body. It's obvious their 
	relationship
	went beyond just teacher/student. There is a loud METALLIC WHINE from 
	the ship's
	hull.

				RIZZO
		What's that?

				BOEMAN
		THat's the sound of deep space attacking the
		integrity of the ship.

				KAY-EM 14
		No...
			(signing)
		That's the sound of the men working
		on the chain gang.

				RIZZO
		Are there any other shuttles?

				JANESSA
		No.

				RIZZO
		Teleportation? Some way to beam us the
		hell out of dodge?

				THORGAN
		You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?

				JANESSA
		A little late to be thinking about
		escape, isn't it?

				KAY-EM 14
		I'll never experience my fantasy of
		three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod.
		Damn.

				THORGAN
		Am I in there?

				KAY-EM 14
		Sory...

				RIZZO
		Hey.

				DELONGPRE
		That's a good fantasy, though.
		Kinky, but good.

				RIZZO
		Hey!!

	All heads turn to Rizzo. She's staring at a schematic of the ship. The 
	left hull
	of the two hulled ship is lit up with blinking light denoting the 
	various 
	system failures. Rizzo points to the right hull.

				RIZZO
		What's this?

				DELONGPRE
		It's the engine, reactors, audiometers,
		it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.

	Rizzo points at the thin walk-ways connecting the two hulls.

				RIZZO
		Can we get through these?

				THORGAN
		Sure but what good will that do?

				BOEMAN
		When the left hull goes, so will the
		right.

				RIZZO
		What if we blow the walkways first?
		Leave Jason over here to go up with
		the ship?

	They stare at her.

				JANESSA
		You know, Yllo seemed to think we could
		catch this guy alive, well, he'd be worth
		millions.

	The others stare at her as if she were crazy.

				RIZZO
		Any connection between your reality and mine
		is purely coincidental.

				JANESSA
		I'm just saying.

				RIZZO
			(to others)
		Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit.
		Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up
		the doors and blow the walkways?

				DELONGPRE
		We'd need charges.

				BOEMAN
		We could convert fission transistors.

				THORGAN
		We're not supposed to do that.

				BOEMAN
		What are you gonna do, tell me?

		DELONGPRE
		The engine room will have molecular welders.
		We could seal up the hull.

	A moment of consideration. Could this actually work?

				JANESSA
		YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big
		guy distracted with a blow job.

				THORGAN
		Would you?

				KAY-EM 14
		Now this is getting exciting.

				DELONGPRE
		Remember to roll his balls around a bit.

				RIZZO
		You got a better plan?

	Obviously they don't. They got to work. Boeman grabs a number of devices 
	from under
	a cabinet.

				BOEMAN
		I'll need system four converters.

				THORGAN
		They're back here.

				DELONGPRE
		How many?

				BOEMAN
		Bring 'em all. Let's move!

	Thorgan's still hooked up to the Nano-Tech machine.

				THORGAN
		Hey! I'm not ready.

				BOEMAN
		Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley
		one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there.
		Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.

				JANESSA
		You're so bossy.

				THORGAN
		You're leaving me here alone?

	Delongpre tosses the chaingun next to him.

				DELONGPRE
		Don't blow your foot off.

	They climb through the hole in the corridor and disappear.

				KAY-EM 14
		It's just you and me, then.

				THORGAN
		Come here, might as well fix that arm.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Boeman, Janessa, Delongpre, and Rizzo slowly move through the piles of 
	debris.
	Still burning cargo creates a ghastly image of flickering shadows.

				DELONGPRE
		See anything?

	They move toward the rubble that had buried Jason before.

	CLOSE on the rubble.

	There is an obvious hole dug out from the middle.

				DELONGPRE
		I think I speak on behalf of the group
		when I say this is bad news.

				BOEMAN
			(into headset)
		Thorgan? You coming?!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Thorgan is fooling around in the back of Kay-Em 14's head. The nano-tech 
	maching is 
	doing a full diagnostics.

				THORGAN
			(into headset)
		Almost done.

				KAY-EM 14
		Ow!

				THORGAN
		Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.

				KAY-EM 14
		Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.

	INT. WALKWAY ONE

	Boeman enters, throws his pack to the ground and goes to work ttaching a 
	device to
	the wall of the huge glass connector.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Janessa enters and goes through the same motions.

	INT. WALKWAY THREE

	Delongpre and Rizzo attach a device to the wall.

				DELONGPRE
		Put your finger here.

	SHe does so. Delongpre connects several wires. Rizzo looks nervous. 
	Delongpre notices.

				DELONGPRE
		My father wanted me to be a businessman.

	Silence.

				DELONGPRE
		That's why I'm here.

				RIZZO
		So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against
		your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.

	Delongpre looks at her like she's crazy.

				DELONGPRE
		My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology 
		is part of the business. We happen to get along just 
	fine,
		smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's 
	balls
		for a change.

				RIZZO
		I thought you meant...

				DELONGPRE
		You thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh?
		You must have been a very lonely girl.

	Silence. Neither speaks.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Thorgan rips a metallic sink from the wall. It CRASHES to the floor.

				THORGAN
		Sorry, sorry.

				KAY-EM 14(O.S.)
		Who are you apologizing to?

				THORGAN
		Good point.

	INT.  WALKWAY ONE

	Boeman attaches another charge. He's sweating. Nervous. Keeps looking
	over his shoulder. Standing alone on this long walkway is a creepy 
	sight.

	INT.  WALKWAY TWO

	Janessa stops working, listens.

	KA-THUMP -- There's anoise in the Cargo Bay.

	She covers the mike on her headset and calls out.

				JANESSA
		Thorgan, you little shit, is that you?

	No answer. She quickly turns to her pack and pulls out the bottle of 
	tranquillizer
	and a monster syring.e She fills this rhino syringe with a massive 
	dosage. Enough to
	bring down a Rhino...or Jason maybe?

	She starts moving down the walkway toward the Cargo Bay.
	Surely she's not that stupid.

	INT.  WALKWAY THREE

	Rizzo is staring at Delongpre as he works on another device.
	Then --

				RIZZO
		When I was four, the ocean quit producing
		life. Too many pollutants. Nuclear testing,
		the occasional terrorist bombing...the
		atmosphere was shit by the time I was eight.
		We moved underground when I was twelve.

	Delongpre stares at her. He doesn't want to speak and screw up this
	rare moment of sharing.

	INT.   CARGO BAY

	Janessa enters. Looks around.

	The cargo bay is dark and looming. Lights flicker. Emergency lights
	strobe. It's hard to make anything out.

	We hear Rizzo speaking Off Screen.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		My father was an army Scientist.
		Genetics. The army thought they could
		develop humans able to survive the Earth
		we had created

	Janessa moves through the debris.

	ANOTHER POV

	We see Janessa come into view.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Jason seemed to have the right stuff.
		Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell
		damage, didn't matter. He just kept
		going.

	INT.  WALKWAY THREE

				DELONGPRE
		Were you close to your father?

	Thorgan interrupts over the headset.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Delongpre? What did you do with the
		chain gun?

	Delongpre frowns.

				DELONGPRE
			(into mike)
		It's on the table where I left it!
		What the hell are you doing?!
		Hurry up!

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		I'm on my way.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Thorgan, quit screwing around and
		come on!

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		I'm coming, I'm coming.

				DELONGPRE
		Sorry, you were saying?

	INT. CARGO BAY

	WATCHER'S POV

	JANESSA approaches the pile of debris where Jason was buried.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		I got along great with my father,
		my mother too. Dad and the others thought
		they could learn a great deal from this 
		thing the army had been keeping on ice for
		over a hundred years.

	Janessa moves the debris around with her foot.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		They were all wrong. They couldn't control
		him.

	INT. WALKWAY THREE

				DELONGPRE
		And what happend to ...?

	Rizzo begins to tear up.

				RIZZO
		I couldn't save them.

				DELONGPRE
		Well, we'd be dead without you.
		You know that, don't you?

	She stares at him.

				DELONGPRE
		It's true.
			(chuckles)
		You caused enough stink that we
		were at least a little cautious.
		Of course this is the first field
		trip I went on that had a body count.

	She gives him a  half smile.

				DELONGPRE
		I'm not much, but I promise, I won't
		let this guy get you.

	Another half smile. It's a sweet gesture, but what can this guy really 
	do?

	INT. CARGO BAY

	JASON'S POV

	He watches Janessa from a  distance. Moving slowly and silently toward 
	her.

	She stands and turns as --

	SERGEANT BRODSKI grabs her!

	She SCREAMS.

	He's covered in blood from a gaping wound in his gut.

				BRODSKI
		Where is everybody? What happened?

				JANESSA
		Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!

				BRODSKI
		Give me a break! What happened?

				JANESSA
		Jason. He's what happened. Then 
		Grendel hit Space Lab.

				BRODSKI
		Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands
		on Yllo.

				JANESSA
		Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.

				BRODSKI
		Takes more than a steelbalde to take
		this old dog down.

	KA-THUNK! 

	JASON"S MACHETE THRUSTS though Brodski's gut. Jason spins Brodski around 
	and tosses him to the floor!

				BRODSKI
		Yup, that ought'a do it.

	Jason turns on Janessa.

	She stands frozen in fear.

	Jason raises his machete and --

	JANESSA

	Lights a flare, blinding Jason for the moment. Then she sinks the Rhino 
	syringe 
	into his chest! Jason stumbles...falls hard on his ass and sits there 
	staring
	at her.

				JANESSA
		Well go on! Pass out!

	Jason tears the syringe away and tosses it aside.

				JANESSA
		Shit.

	Jason starts to climb to his feet. Janessa turns to run.

				BRODSKI
			(weak)
		He-help me...

	He holds his hand out to her. Then--

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		I'm blowing Walkway One. Hold on.

	KA-FOOM! The SHIP BUCKS!

	Janessa runs, leaving the sergeant behind.

	INT.  CARGO BAY - OUTSIDE WALKWAY THREE

	Delongpre closes the door, then --

				DELONGPRE
		We're blowing three. Hang on.

	He throws a switch!

	INT. CARGO BAY - BRIDGE SIDE

	Boeman vaults over a pile of rubble.

				BOEMAN
		Janessa, we're on our way to you!

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Holding hands, Delongpre and Rizzo enter. They stop...stand...stare.

	The walkway is empty. Janessa is gone.

	Boeman rushes up behind them.

				BOEMAN
		Where is...?

				DELONGPRE
		You tell me! She's only set one
		charge. And it's not finished!

	With that Janessa tears into the walkway. She's out of breath. She can 
	barely speak.

				BOEMAN
		Where have you been?!!

				JANESSA
		He....He...

				DELONGPRE
		He's coming!!!

	THEIR POV

	JASON moves through the debris. He's coming straight for them.

				BOEMAN
		Run!!

	They race down the length of the walkway. Jason right behind them.

				RIZZO
		We can't lead him into the other hull!

				BOEMAN
		We don't have a choice!

	Boeman slams the door panel. The door slowly rises.

	Jason approaches, stops, stares at his future victims. If he could smile
	with anticipation...he would. He raises his Machete --

	Then stops. Lowers it.

	CHA-CHUNG. CHA-CHUNG. CHA-CHUNG.

	He turns his back on our heroes. They crane their necks to see what has 
	pulled
	his attention.

	THORGAN marches down the walkway with KAY-EM 14. The new and imporved 
	KAY-EM 14.

	Where her severed arm had once been, a chain gun is now attached. A 
	laser cannon is
	mounted over her shoulder. Her body has been reinforced with steel from 
	around the lab.
	Sinks, trays, you name it. She's the junk yard man's terminator. Then --

				KAY-EM 14
		Do I have to?

				THORGAN
		Yes, I've reprogrammed you.
		You are very brave. Bad ass.

				KAY-EM 14
		Oh, alright.

	KAY-EM 14 INTERNAL SCAN POV

	We see a somewhat computerized image of Jason through Kay-Em's personal 
	scan.
	One the display we see:

	SUBJECT: DEAD
	CHANCES OF FUNCTION: 100 PERCENT
	DOES NOT COMPUTE . . . DESTROY SUBJECT

				KAY-EM 14
		Come on, boy. Let's see if we can
		open up  can'a whoop ass!

	BRAAAATTTT! The chain gun rings! Jason is SLAMMED into the HULL DOORS.

				DELONGPRE
		Holy shit!

	JASON jumps up and rushes at Kay-Em who catches him and tosses him down 
	the walkway --

	BRAAAATTT! Kay-Em opens up again. Kay-Em's weaponry shoves Jason out 
	into the cargo
	bay witha  blur of bullets.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				BOEMAN
		What are we waiting for?!!
		Come on!!

	Our heroes rush down the walkway toward the cargo bay. Boeman and 
	Delongpre go to
	work setting the charges.

				BOEMAN
			(to Janessa)
		Where the hell were you?!!

				JANESSA
		He came for me, I had to run!

				THORGAN
			(into mike)
		Kay-Em, you okay?

	INT. CARGO BAY

				KAY-EM 14
		Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.

	And with that, Kay-Em BLOWS the now standing Jason into another wall 
	with the laser 
	cannon.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

				BOEMAN
		Toss me a chip.

	Delongpre pulls a trinket from his pack and pitches it to Boeman.

				BOEMAN
		Thorgan, you're brilliant.
		Have I told you that lately?

	Thorgan is standing at the end of the walkway staring into the cargo 
	bay.
	He looks sad.

				THORGAN
			(quietly)
		See you around.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Kay-Em 14 marches toward the downed Jason, and starts singing an old Sea 
	Shanty.

				KAY-EM 14
		She's the Yellow Rose of Taegu,
		the girl that I adore. Her cunt
		it smells like cock juice; she's
		a good two-dollar whore. You may
		talk to me of Seoul girls or whores
		from Tokyo, but the yellow rose of 
		Taegu beats them all, I'd you know.

	BRATTTT!!!

	Kay-Em blows Jason into --

	INT. HALL BETWEEN LABS AND CARGO

	She kicks him down the long corridor.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO 

	The hull SCREAMS from the exterior pressure. The ship RUMBLES.

				BOEMAN
		I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.

				DELONGPRE
		Then stop talking and work faster!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Jason BURSTS through the debris that had been blocking the Lab!
	Kay-Em enters behind him.

				KAY-EM 14
			(still singing)
		She was a young and charming girl;
		her age was scarce sixteen.

	JASON rushes KAY-EM 14!

				KAY-EM 14
		She took me in and she kicked out
		a sailor and marine.

	KA-CHING!!!!

	His machete bounces off of Kay-Em's new armor.

				KAY-EM 14
		She had no titties on her chest;
		that didn't bother me,

	WHAM!

	Kay-Em 14 back hands Jason across the room. He crashes into the glass
	speciments. Goo and formaldehyde covering him.

				KAY-EM 14
		For what she had between her legs
		was big enough for three.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Boeman and Delongpre are finishing up.

				BOEMAN
		Okay, Janessa, give me your last charge.

	Janessa looks around, then --

				JANESSA
		I...I don't know what I did...

				DELONGPRE
		You lost the charge?

				JANESSA
		He was chasing me!

				RIZZO
		Can we blow it with just two?

				BOEMAN
		If we don't sever the hull completely
		she'll drag us down with her.

				DELONGPRE
		Then what do we do?!

				BOEMAN
		I don't know!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Kay-Em stands over Jason. And for the first time in ten films Jason is 
	in bad shape.
	But still climbs to his feet...slowly.

				KAY-EM 14
		Why you low life, scum sucking,
		rat dick blowing, sum bitch.
		Your mamma must'a had some huge balls.

	Of course, as anyone knows, you don't diss Jason's mother.

	Jason leaps, tacking Kay-Em 14! They roll into another glass case. 
	Glass, formaldehyde and specimens
	rain down on top of them.

	Having lost his machete, Jason BASHES at Kay-Em with his fists. OVER and 
	OVER. He
	catches a rhythm. Kay-Em is trapped below.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

				DELONGPRE
		Well, it was a good plan.

	They look at one another -- hopless. Then --

				BRODSKI(O.S.)
		You stupid bitch!

	Everyone jumps as Sergeant Brodski leans against the walkway door frame.
	He's bound his wounds with a make-shift tourniquet wrapped around his 
	mid-section.

				BRODSKI
		Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!

				BOEMAN
		Sergeant? We thought you were...

				BRODSKI
		Yeah, yeah.
			(to Janessa)
		Well, what have you got to say for yourself?

				JANESSA
		I don't know...sorry?

				RIZZO
		Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.

				BRODSKI
		Bomb?

				BOEMAN
		Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.

	The sergeant tosses his pack to the ground.

				BRODSKI
		How much you need?

	INT. LAB ONE

	WHAM...WHAM...WHAM... A RAIN of firststaking on this droid from the 
	future.

	Finally, Jason stops. Straddling KAy-Em 14 he stares at his kill...until 
	--

				KAY-EM 14
			(condescending)
		That was very good. You should
		feel very good about yourself
		right now. Good effort.
			(tough voice)
		How could you hit a girl you sumbitch?!

	Kay-Em 14 places the chaingun over Jason's chest.

	BRAAAATTTT!!!!

	Jason is blown across the room!

				KAY-EM 14
		Okay, dip shit. Time to finish
		you off so I can go home and boink
		your momma with a corndog. The kinky
		bitch.

	Chaingun and laser cannon UNLEASH A MASSIVE DISPLAY on the fleshly body 
	of
	JASON VOORHEES.

	The top portion of Jason's mask shatters!

	hIS RIGHT LEG IS TURNED INTO A PILE OF MEAT, then blown clean off for 
	good measure!
	Jason falls on his ass!

	He raises his machete arm. A last ditch effort. Could he be that lucky?
	To throw a machete and stop this onslaught?

	CHA-CHING!

	NOPE.

				KAY-EM 14
			(singing)
		Bang, bang Maxewells silver hammer
		came down upon his head. Doo-pee-
		do-do. Bang, bang Maxewell's silver
		hammer made sure that he was dead...

	Jason climbs to his one good leg but i t only serves as a better aim
	for Kay-Em 14.

	KA-FOOM! The laser cannon blows Jason's left arm to hell.

	KA-FOOM! KA-FOOM!

	Two more blasts send Jason flying through the back wall and sliding 
	across the floor.

	KAY-EM 14'S INTERNAL SCAN POV

	This time, Jason's body doesn't move.

	SUBJECT: DEAD
	CHANCE OF FUNCTION: ZERO PERCENT
	MISSION OF OBJECTIVES: COMPLERED

				KAY-EM 14
		Oh...my...god. What have I done?
			(crying)
		Thorgan!

	Kay-Em turns and races down the hall.

				KAY-EM 14
		Thorgan I'm a murderer!

	INT.  WALKWAY TWO

	Boeman and Delongpre hustle to set the final charge.

				BRODSKI
		Blowing the walkway? You come up
		with that yourself?

				BOEMAN
		Rizzo did.

	CHA-CHUNG...CHA-CHUNG. Kay-Em steps into the walkway. She's covered in
	blood.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em!

				BOEMAN
		What are you doing back?!!

				KAY-EM 14
			(sad)
		Sumbitch won't be giving us
		anymore trouble.

				RIZZO
		You killed him?

				KAY-EM 14
			(regret)
		Blew half his skull away, one leg,
		one arm and left his entrails
		stretched across the lab. And look
		at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!

				THORGAN
		You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.

				KAY-EM 14
		A real mamma's boy that one.
		Dissed his mamma and he nearly
		threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.

				RIZZO
		His mother?

				BOEMAN
		What?

				RIZZO
		I don't know. Nothing.

	Suddenly the ship's hull SCREAMS. The ship BUCKS. Everyone tumbles.

				BOEMAN
		Hurry up people! We're running out
		of time.

	INT.  LAB ONE 

	Jason's body is propped up against a machine in the same position we saw 
	it before. This
	mass of torn flesh doesn't move.

	The ship BUCKS again.

	The machine HUMS to life. BUZZING and BEEPING. Suddenly a laser scans 
	Jason's
	body.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	Jason is leaned up against the Nano-Tech machine.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Thorgan runs wire to each device.

				THORGAN
		As long as they're connected we can 
		blow them all simultaneously from
		a safe distance.

				BOEMAN
		Two more charges to go.

	INT. LABE ONE - NANO-TECH MACHINE

	We see a schematic of Jason's battered body on the monitor. Nano-
	technology
	is already at work.

	Hoses and wires now encircle Jason's body. We follow one of the hoses 
	until it ends
	over --

	A WASTE BEND

	nside we see pile of bullets. Stuff falls from the hose. Bullets from 
	the chaingun,
	bullets from  every previous Jason movie. A broken machete blade drops 
	to the pile.
	The tip of an arrow. A couple of knives. A pair of pliers. An ink pen. 
	The skeleton
	of a fish.

	The scanning lasers move to the stump at Jason's shoulder. We see the 
	image as a new arm, fuzzy
	adn distorted, is being constructed.

	On the schematic, we see Jason's internal organs being repaired.

	By now  we've figured out ...nothing good can come of this.

	INT.  WALKWAY TWO

	Kay-Em 14 hits a button. The door begins to slide down slowly.

				THORGAN
		Done!

				BOEMAN
		Let's move out!

				BRODSKI
		Kid, you ever thought about the marine corp?

	Delongpre calls fromthe far end of the walkway, welder in his hand.

				DELONGPRE
		I need another minute. Come on!

	ON OUR HEROES

	Suddenly there is a GRINDING SOUND. Engines WHINE from behind them.

	The group stops and turns.

	The cargo door is starting to smoke. It SQUEALS as it slowly opens.

				BRODSKI
		Well fuck me.

				KAY-EM 14
		No, fuck me.

	The door opens and Jason steps into the walkway.

	But he's no Jason we've ever seen before. His leg and arm are now
	SHINY METAL. His clothes are BLACK, no longer tattered. His mask is 
	CHROME.
	We can't see them, but we know...his insides are in better shape than 
	ever.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em? Re-engage killer instinct.

				KAY-EM 14
		Yeeee-haw!!!!

	BRAAAATTTTT!

	Kay-em firs. But, this time it doesn't seem to faze Jason. SPARKS fly as
	bullets vounce off of his metal limbs.

	Jason swings his new improved machete. It CLANGS off of Kay-Em's armor, 
	removing a hunk of metal.

	Jason grabs her and swings her into the glass walkway. Glass CRACKS.
	One of the wires, connecting two charges severs.

				BOEMAN
		Shit!

	Kay-em does a back flip, kicking Jason in the chest. He's shoved 
	backwards.

	Boeman attempts to splice the wires back together as the battle ensues.

	IT'S MASSIVE! Intellectual synthetic droid verses psychotic metallic 
	killer.
	SPARKS FLY. GUNFIRE SOUNDS. Then Kay-Em does a round house kick, but 
	Jason uses 
	his machete as a shield. Kay-Em's leg is nearly sliced off at the knee.

	She stumbles...falls to the ground.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em!!!

	Boeman splices the wires together.

				BOEMAN
		Done!!

	Then turns to see Jason approaching.

				BOEMAN
		RUN!!

	But Jason's too close. He grabs Boeman.

	ON KAY-EM

	As her body separates from her legs mid-thigh. CHCHHHHH!
	THRUSTERS IGNITE from her lower thighs.

	As Jason raises his machete to do Boeman in --

	KA-FWAM! Kay-Em slams into him! Knocking Boeman free.

	Jason and the now hovering Kay-Em go at it again.

	CHANG! CLANG! CLUNK! Metal against metal. Kay-Em hovers up the walls, 
	over Jason's 
	head...but Jason has come into his own with these new body parts. She's 
	no match. Finally --

	JASON EMBEDS HIS MACHETE IN KAY-EM'S THROAT

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jason rears back and shoves his fist though Kay-Em's chestplate! his 
	fist from Kay-Em's
	chest and wraps his metallic hand around he throat.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em! Get away!

	Thorgan moves toward his robotic love but Boeman grabs him and pulls him 
	down
	the hall.

				KAY-EM 14
		That's the best you can do?

	Jason yanks his machete from the side of Kay-Em's neck. Severing her 
	head
	from her body. It flies down the hallway behind the kids.

				KAY-EM 14
		Is that it? Come back and fight like a man!

	JASON 

	Turns his glare on our heroes racing toward Delongpre at the other end.

	DELONGPRE

				DELONGPRE
		Done!

	Delongpre lifts his welder's mask to call to the others when he sees 
	JASON.

				DELONGPRE
		Shit, hurry!

	OUR HEROES

	Run toward the door. But, Thorgan stops.

				BOEMAN
		What...?

	Thorgan turns, runs back toward Jason.

				BOEMAN
		What are you doing?!!

	Thorgan is running to retrieve Kay-Em 14's head. It lies between he and 
	Jason.
	He'll never make it!  Thorgan hits the floor, slides and scoops up the 
	head.

				KAY-EM 14
		I think I'm going to throw up...

	BUT IT'S TOO LATE.

	Jason raises his machete from his belt and --

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Hey, dickhead!

	JASON TURNS AS --

	KA-CHUNG!!!! Rizzo nails him with a metal ar.

				RIZZO
			(to Thorgan)
		Go!

	Jason stumbles backwards then whirls on Rizzo.

				RIZZO
		Oh, yeah, you remember me.

	He sure does.

	She turnsa dn runs.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As the others race into the engien room they turn to watch.

				BOEMAN
		Hurry!

				DELONGPRE
		Faster! Don't we have another gun?

	Rizzo catches up to Thorgan but they have a long way to go
	and Jason is gaining.

				JANESSA
		They're not gonna make it. Close the door
		before he gets us all.

				DELONGPRE
		They'll make it.

				JANESSA
		Close the fucking door!

				DELONGPRE
		NO!

	JANESSA leaps forward and hits the switch. The door begins sliding 
	slowly shut.

				DELONGPRE
		Damnit!

	Boeman hits the button again.

				DELONGPRE
			(glares at Janessa)
		Forget it. I had to rewire it.
		Once it's started it won't stop.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	JASON

	TWENTY PACES BEHIND

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM

				DELONGPRE
		Get ready to blow it.

	Rizzo dives, slides under the closing door.

	Thorgan follows her lead, but his slide doesn't have the same force. He 
	stops with the door
	coming down on his lower back.

	Luckily, Delongpre snatches his arms and yanks him through.

	The door closes!

				DELONGPRE
		Now!

	Boeman turns the switch.

	INT.  MIDSHIP WALK WAY

	The charges BLOW! A FIREBALL rushes toward the running JASON!

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM

	CLOSE ON DOOR

	AS KA-FWAM!!!

	JASON'S BODY IMPRINTS IN THE NOW SEALED DOOR.

	EXT. GRENDEL

	The walkway explodes, severing Grendel into two separate hulls. 
	The left damaged hull, sinks out of view as the engine side begins
	to pull away. Then --

	KA-FOOM!!

	Grendel's LEFT HULL finallay EXPLODES!! They barely amde it.

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM

	The right hull BUCKS from the force of the blast. Our heroes are 
	aireborne for a moment 
	then crash to the floor.

				BRODSKI
		Damage?

	Boeman climbs to a console.

				BOEMAN
		Minimal.

				RIZZO
		We made it?

				DELONGPRE
		I think...I think maybe we did.

	CHEERS

	Thorgan looks into Kay-Em 14's severed head.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em we made it!

				KAY-EM 14
		Oh, goody. I'm so pleased.
		I'd clap if I could.

	Boeman CLICKS on a console keyboard.

				BOEMAN
		I've changed the course for Earth II.
		And I sent a distress signal.

				VOICE(V.O.)
		Roger, Grendel. What's the problem?

				BOEMAN
			(into mike)
		Our ship has been damaged, most of
		the crew dead. We need evac.

				VOICE
		Copy that Grendel. Rescue enroute.
		You should hit EARTH II orbit in fifteen
		minutes. Rescue ETA twenty minutes.

	CHEERS!

				BOEMAN
		We're going home people.

	More CHEERS.

	Rizzo turns to find Delonpre staring at her.

				DELONGPRE
			(big smile)
		See? We're not so bad.

				RIZZO
		Not so bad.

	There's that moment when we think the two might kiss. She takes a step
	toward him. Yes, they are going to kiss --

	BOOM!

	WARNING LIGHTS. WARNING ALARMS. The sound of SUCKING WIND. AS JASON,
	still very alive shoves his fist through the imprinted door with his
	metal hand!

	As he rips a bigger hole to gain entrance our heroes are fighting to 
	hold
	on to anything.

	The Hole is sucking everything not tied down out into space.

	Boeman is the first to reach the reactor room door.

				BOEMAN
		This way!

	He pulls Sergeant Brodski through the door as -- 

	JASON

	Fights his way through the opening in the hull.

	The engines BUCK and begin to SMOKE.

				BOEMAN
		The pressures cause the engines to overheat!
		Hurry!

	Delongpre helps Rizzo and Thorgan to safety.

	Janessa crawls across the floor digging her fingers into the steel mesh.

	SERGEANT BRODKSI

	Lying in the door's threshold reaches out and snags her hand.

				JANESSA
		Pull me in!

				BRODSKI
		I'm pulling, damnit!

	But Jason grabs Janessa's ankle and jerks. She's pulled from the 
	Sergeant's
	grasp.

	She flops around in the sucking wind as Jason watches. He lets go.

	She flies toward the hole, slams into it.

	Everything goes quiet for a moment. As he body has sealed the hole then 
	--

	SHHHHHHHHOOOOOK!

	She's sucked into space in a most grotesque manner.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				BRODSKI
		Well, that's a shame.

	INT. REACTOR CORE

	Hug cylindrical machines run the length of this enormous room.
	They HUM quietly as our group enters.

				BRODSKI
		We need weapons.

				RIZZO
		Weapons? All this technology and
		what good has it done?!

				DELONGPRE
		It bought us some time.

				BOEMAN
		And now we're all out of it.

	Everyone stares at Boeman. He's standing at another console.

				BOEMAN
		The ship's depressurizing, the engines
		overheating. When it  reaches the core,
		we're done.

				RIZZO
		Done?

				THORGAN
		Kaboom.

				DELONGPRE
		Again?! Jesus!

				RIZZO
		Why am I not surprised?

	Thorgan still clutches Kay-Em 14's severed head.

				KAY-EM 14
		You must shut down the engines.

				DELONGPRE
		Then do it. The rescue ship can
		find us here right?

				BRODSKI
		Can't shut em' down from here.

				BOEMAN
		Somebody's gonna have to go back
		to the engine room.

				DELONGPRE
		You ain't catching my ass in there again.

	Brodski, still bleeding, pale, struggling to stand --

				BRODSKI
		I'll go.

	The kids give him the "are you crazy?" stare.

				BOEMAN
		You're too weak. I'll go.

	KA-FWAM! Everyone jumps but this time it's only Rizzo. She broke a metal 
	stand and has
	yanked one of the legs free.

				RIZZO
		You know, this future shit sucks.
		I'll fucking do it.

				DELONGPRE
		You?

				RIZZO
			(mumbling)
		Wait around on your asses all day.
			(turns to Thorgan)
		I'll need a distraction.

				THORGAN
		What kind of a distraction?

	INT. ENGINE ROOM

	JASON is pounding on the reactor room door. A difficult act with the 
	continued pressure 
	trying to suck him into space.

	THEN
				RIZZO
		HEY!

	Jason turns to find Rizzo standing in the doorway behind him. 

				RIZZO
		You want some of me?

	Jason whirls around and lurches toward her clinging to machinery as he 
	goes.


	INT.  ENGINE ROOM CORRIDOR

	Rizzo backs slowly as Jason closes in.

	As he reaches the corridor, she turns and runs.

	RIZZO

				RIZZO
		Come on, keep up.

	Jason barrels toward her.

				RIZZO
		You want some of me or not?

	She stops at a door, but doesn't attmept ot open it.

	Jason comes closer..and closeer...but Rizzo doesn't move --

	Jason moves in for the kill, raises his machete, and --

				RIZZO
		Take your best shot --

	SLASH!

	RIZZO'S CHEST IS SPLIT OPEN!

				RIZZO
			(laughs)
		I'm melting! I'm melting!

	SLASH! Her arm falls to the ground!

				RIZZO
		See now that was stupid.
		Persistent, yes, but stupid.

	Jason shoves his fist, through her chest and into the wall.

				RIZZO
		Not this time, asshole. This time
		I'm gonna watch you burn in hell.

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 

	The real RIZZO rips off her virtual reality helmet.

				RIZZO
		Make it fast. He's coming.

	Delongpre is punching numbers into the keypad. Both are wearing 
	headsets.

				DELONGPRE
		Almost got it.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As Jason returns to the engine room, none too pleased at being tricked.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue
		ship on radar.

				RIZZO
		Delongpre! Out of time!

				DELONPRE
		Got it!

	Rizzo jersk Delonpre and both spill into the reactor
	corridor. Rizzo slaps the panel. the door closes!
	Shutting out Jason's image.

				DELONGPRE
		Damn that was close!

	WHAM!

	THE ENGINE ROOM door RIPS in half. JASON CLIMBS through.

	RIZZO AND DELONGPRE RUN!

				RIZZO
			(into radio)
		Guys, he's right behind us!

		THORGAN(V.O.)
		It's okay.

		DELONGPRE
		Okay?!!

		THORGAN(V.O.)
		Just come on, I've got an idea.

	They race down the long corridor toward the reactor room.
	JASON IN PURSUIT.

	INT. DOCKING BAY

	Thorgan is typing like mad at small portable keyboard.
	Boeman stares out the docking bay window.

	HIS POV 

	There's damage, lots of it.

				BOEMAN
			(into radio)
		The docking bay was damaged after the
		explosion. Meet us at the airlock.

	INT. REACTOR ROOM corridor.

				DELONGPRE
		Got it.
			(to Rizzo)
		You ever space walked?

				RIZZO
		Oh sure, all the time.

	They leap through a door, closing it behind them, then keep running.

	BEHIND THEM

	KA-FWAM! Jason barrels right through the door.

				RIZZO
			(into headset)
		Damit, Thorgan, whatever you're doing...
		you'd better hurry!
			(growls)
		I hate the future!

	INT.  REACTOR CORE

	Rizzo and Delongpre enter in a  mad rush. Delongpre closes the door.
	Little good it'll do.

	INT. REACTOR ROOM CORRIDOR

	JASON kicks the door with his metallic leg!

	KA-FWAM! The door shatters and he stumlbes into --

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Forest, cabins, the lake. Everything as we and Jason remember.
	But somehow distroted. A strange hue covers everything.

	No, on second look, it's not exactly the way we remember. The trees are
	strange looking. Not the Pines and Oaks of Connecticut, but something 
	foreign.
	The cabins look a little too advanced to be stuck in the middle of a 
	camp.
	But the image will do.
					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	Thorgan stands at a keyboard clicking away. Boeman is wearing a space 
	suit.
	He's helping sergeatn Brodski into his.

	At the other end of the huge room, Jason wanders ... with confusion.

				THORGAN
		Don't worry. He can't see us.

	Rizzo glances out the docking bay window.

				RIZZO
		Is that...?

	THROUGH WINDSHIELD

	We see a planet much the same color as Earth, but the continents are 
	wrong.

				DELONGPRE
		Earth II.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Suit up.

	Delongpre leads Rizzo to a suit.

				DELONGPRE
		I'll help you in.

				THORGAN
			(into headset)
		Kay-Em, you've saved our lives,
		you know that don't you?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Kay-Em 14's head sits on the floor in the center of room.

				KAY-EM 14
		It was my pleasure, my love.
		Perhaps if all works for the best
		you can rebuild me and we can try that
		doggie style thing again.

	DOCKING BAY

	The others stare at Thorgan...he looks embarrassed to say the least.

				DELONGPRE
		I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.

	ON KAY-EM

				KAY-EM 14
			(singing happily)
		I get no kick from champaign, mere
		alcohol doesn't faze me at all,
		but I get a kick out of you.

				THORGAN
			(under his breath)
		Goodbye, my love.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Thorgan, suit up.

				THORGAN
			(to Rizzo)
		This is gonna work. If he sticks to the
		program. Will he? Stick to the program?

				RIZZO
		His mother was killed before his eyes.
		That's what drove him insane. It'll work.

				DELONGPRE
		That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of
		that future shit.

				RIZZO
		Eat me.

	She smiles as she jersk the helmet out of his hand.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jason slowly walks beside Kay-Em 14.

					QUICK-CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Jason is walking along the lake when he sees --

	A CAMPFIRE off in the distance. LAUGHTER, SINGING.
	CAMPERS!!!

	He takes off toward the campfire, then hears --

	SPLASHING. 

	He turns.

	HIS POV

	Within the distorted lake, someone is drowning. Could it be a little 
	boy?
	A little Jason from many years ago?

				WOMAN
		Help me!
			(gurgles)
		Jason help me!

	JASON

	Moves toward the beach. Steps partly into the water.

	HIS POV

	THE WOMAN, THE VOICE. IT'S JASON'S MOTHER!

	He turns toward the campfire, back to his mother...what to do?! Then --

	JASON TEARS INTO THE WATER, TRYING TO REACH HER.

				MRS. VOORHEES
		Help me, Jason, please! Help your mother!

	Jason moves closer.

				MRS. VOORHEES
		Don't let me die again!

	As he draws near, she reaches out her hands to him.

	JASON

	Pauses staring at the please for help.

	He stares into her pleading face. HIS MOTHER! After all these years!

	He places his hand over her face, gently, then --

	PUSHES HER UNDER!

	He holds her there.

								QUICK-CUT TO:

	INT. REACTOR ROOM

				KAY-EM 14
		Uh-oh. That's not a part of the program.
		Thorgan, we've got a problem!

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE 

	Camp Cyrstal lake begins to jerk and fade.

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	Everyone is suited up. Delongpre, the last, is adjusting his helmet.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Oh, shit. He's going to see us.

				DELONGPRE
		Well, do something!

	Thorgan grabs the portable keyboard and starts typing away!

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Suddenly the image solidifies then a number of the aliens from the game
	grid appear. But Jason's seen these guys before. He tears through them.

	INT. REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

				THORGAN
		Shit!

	Boeman hits the door panel to the docking bay. It begins to slowly rise.

				BOEMAN
		Just a little more time.

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Jason stands atop a pile of dead alien like some strange Conan in space.
	The image flickers...he  catches a glimpse of our heroes at the end fo 
	the 
	room. He starts toward them.

	Then a huge white fluffy bunny with huge breasts appears before him.

				WHITE FLUFFY BUNNY
			(sings; deep african american voice)
		I'm'a big fluffy bunny...a big white fluffy bunny...

	SWISH! The bunny's head is severed. The image distortss. Again we see 
	our 
	heroes. Jason is closer.

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	The door is halway open. Our heroes start ducking under.

	Jason is almost on them.

				RIZZO
		Thorgan!!!!

	He's clicking away like a mad man.

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	A ROCK BAND appears playing some futuristic metal. Then CHEERLEADERS in 
	scantily clad outfits. Then a MIDGIT in a cowboy hat riding by on a 
	tricycle. We have now entered Thorgan's twisted streams of conciousness.

	Jason tears through the aboe. His goal now clear. The distractions no
	longer fool him.

	A volley ball court appears with naked girls bouncing around.
	A fat man wearing only a spiked leather Speedo. A huge turtle.
	A couple of goats.

	Nothing is stopping Jason.

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	Boeman reaches out and jerks Thorgan into the inner air lock.

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	The image finally disintergrates.

	Jason finds himself staring at our heroes. He lunges for the air lock, 
	but --

	Sergeant Brodski dives, hitting Jason in the chest and knocking him to 
	the
	floor.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Sergeant!

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Get out of here!

	SERGEANT BRODSKI, still in Jason's clutches, kicks at the door panel.

	The door starts to close as Jason begins hacking with his machete.

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		That all you got?!!

	Jason hacks and hack, stabbing through the space suit, until finally, 
	the tough
	old leather neck is silent for good.

	INT.  AIR LOCK

	The door is sealed.

				RIZZO
		He saved our lives.

	Boemen hits another button, and the outer door begins to open.

				DELONGPRE
		Boeman, the ships not here.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Use the thrusters and you'll
		be fine. We'll huddle together
		out there.

	EXT.  WHAT'S LEFT OF THE GRENDEL

	AS THE OUTER DOOR OPENS, RIZZO UNCOMFORTABLY FIDGETS WITH HER SUIT.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Hey, easy now.

	He points to where her hand hovers over some buttons on her sleeve.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You wanna release your air tanks?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
			(nervous)
		Okay, good tip.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You'll be fine.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters.
		We'll be fine.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around.
		So far so good.

	WHAM!

	Jason starts pounding from the other side.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Don't worry. He can't get through that door.

	Delongpre's right. This isn't some thin interior door or some
	walkway door reinforced by a high school kid. This is an air lock
	door. Built to withstand laser cannons and meteors.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Thrusters.

	CHSHSHSHSH. CHSHSH.

	Our group enters deep space.

	EXT.  WHAT'S LEFT OF GRENDEL

	Rizzo, Thorgan, Boeman and Delongpre look tiny next to the massive
	right hull. They thrust slowly into space.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo, you okay?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		No I'm not okay! I don't
		know what the hell I'm doing!

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You're doing fine. I won't let
		anything happen to you, remember?

					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT. DOCKING BAY

	Jason finally gives up with the massive pounding. He steps back.
	Turns, stares at the sergeants' dead body, then looks at --

	THE DOOR PANEL

	He preses the button

	the ari lock door begins to open. Air is suddenly sucked out of the 
	room!

	Sergeant Brodski's body flies out into space. Everything not tied down 
	races out 
	along with him.

	ON KAY-EM 14'S HEAD

	AS it skitters across the floor --

				KAY-EM 14
		Ahhhhh!

	-- and right out the air lock

	JASON 

	holds onto a machine until the door is open, then lets go!
	He shoots out into space.

	EXT. GRENDEL

	Jason flies out of the air lock.

	HIS POV

	He's rocketing right toward one of the space suits!

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I think I had some when I was eight.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Did you like it?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I think so, why?

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		He's trying to ask you out on a date.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Shut up, Thorgan!

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Delongpre, you don't even know me.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		I know you.

	Suddenly Rizzo is SLAMMED from behind. She and Jason go spinning away 
	from
	the others.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Nooooooo!!

	RIZZO

	grapples with Jason, but JASON IS JUST TOO STRONG.

	Jason holds HER with his good hand and REARS his metallic hand back. 
	He's
	going to punch a hole right through her helmet, most likely throat her 
	head,
	when --

	WHAM!

	Delongpre rockets into Jason, but Jason's got one of his arms
	sticking through one of Rizzo's harnesses. THe three go tumbling.

	Delongpre clings to Jason's back.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo, pull away!

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I'm stuck!

	Jason reaches back, grabs Delongpre and jersk him over his head until 
	he's holding Delongpre
	around the thoat. He'll pop his helmet like a cork!

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	AS Thorgan and Boeman thrust towards the tumbling mass...

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		We're too far away!

	BACK TO JASON

	AS he tightens his grip around Delongpre's neck. He can't fight back.

	RIZZO is fighting to untangle her harness. We can hear
	Delongpre CHOKING over the radio.

	The three are spinning even closer and closer towards EARTH II.

	Then, Rizzo reaches down. She grabs Delongpre's leg and CLICKS a button 
	on her sleeve.

	KA-CHSSHSH!!!

	HER AIR TANK BLOWS!

	JASON IS THROWN OFF OF THEM!

	But he's still tangled in Rizzo's hoses. And now she has no air.

	Jason turns...grabs the hoses and begins pulling himself
	toward Rizzo and Delongpre.

	He has them...when --

	WHAM!

	BRODSKI

	Still barely alive barrels into Jason, vlinging to his back.
	He turns, slashes with his knife and severs the hoses.

	Jason and Brodski tumble towards EARTH II.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Rizzo's turning blue. She's about to pass out, when --

	Delongpre pulls a hose from his suit and hooks it into her tank.

	CHSHSHSH...

	AIR BEGINS TO FLOW.

	Rizzo takes a big GASP...coughs.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You okay?!

				RIZZO(V.O.)
			(breathing steadily)
		Oh great...yeah, having a great
		time, and you?

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		No thank you, you crazy old woman.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Old woman?

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Well I mean, technically you are old
		enough to be my great, great, great...

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I get it.

	Suddenly Boeman and Thorgan grab them.  The four survivors huddle 
	together.

				KAY-EM 14
		Hello? A little assistance here?

	They turn to see Kay-Em's head floating close by. Thorgan graps at her 
	and pulls
	her head into his arms.

	THE GROUP CHEERS.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Kay-em you okay?

				KAY-EM 14
		I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		I missed you too.

				KAY-EM 14
		I love you.

	Those two aren't the only two.

	CLOSE ON RIZZO AND DELONGPRE

	Their glass face masks are touching. They stare into each other's 
	eyes.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Chinese, huh?

	They laugh and turn to stare toward EARTH II.

	EXT.  EARTH II -- ORBIT

	Suddenly Jason's body comes into view. It's racing toward Earth II.
	Brodski riding it like Slim Pickens.

				BRODSKI
		Yeee---Haaaaa!!

	Slowly they begin entering the atmosphere.

	Immediately Brodski is engulfed in flames and is gone. He was a good
	man...stay to the end to make sure the job was done right.

	Spread eagle and alone, facing the planet below, Jason continues his
	descent.

	His fingers wiggle as his chrome mask begins to heat up.
	It begins to glow. His metallic arm and leg glow.

	Flames build as he rockets towards Earth II.

	Flesh BUBBLES and OOZES.

	His legs and arms begin to flail as hunks of burning flesh fall from his 
	body!

	EXT.  CAMP SIGHT

	Four kids sit on futuristic sleeping bags around an old fashion 
	campfire.

				KID # 1
		Hey! Check that out!

	They look up and see a blaze shooting towards Earth II.

				KID # 2
		A falling star!

				KID # 3
		It's a meteor dickhead.

				KID # 2
		It's still cool.

	It LIGHTS up the night, then --

	EXPLODES IN A BRILLIANT FIREWORKS DISPLAY!

				KID # 1
		Cool!!!

	From the explosion, one small smoldering chunk falls toward Earth II.

	EXT.  CRYSTAL RESERVOIR

	OUR POV

	As the chunk falls closer and closer we see that it is a glowing chrome
	hockey mask!

	IT HITS THE WATER with a SSSSS!!!!

	BACK TO KIDS

				KID # 4
		Damn! It his the reservoir.

				KID # 1
		Let's go check it out!

	The others agree as they grab their flashlights and head in toward what
	could be a wonderful new discovery.

								DISSOLVE INTO:

	A STREAM.

	The hockey mask washes down the stream, comes to a halt at a pair of
	grusomely charred hands. 

	THE FINGERS,

	TWITCH, curl around the mask, lifting it off camera. AND WE --

	FADE OUT, a familiar KI-KI-KI-KI-HA-HA-HA-HA, resonating as we --

	ROLL CREDITS

	THE END 
              FADE IN:
 
 
         1    EXT.  ROAD - DAY
 
              The TRACK is SILENT.
 
              The CAMERA looks at a sign.  It reads:
 
                                    CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE
                                     Established 1935
 
              Gradually we can begin to hear, in the BG, the SOUNDS of
              CHILDREN playing.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
         2    EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY
 
              In the BG a few dozen CHILDREN, in camp uniforms, are enjoying
              a game of softball.
 
              In the FG CLAUDETTE is looking for someone.  CLAUDETTE is 17
              years old.  She is pretty.  She wears a t-shirt with "Assistant
              Counsellor" written on it.  She fills out the shirt very well.
 
              Failing to find whomever she is looking for, CLAUDETTE walks
              quickly in the opposite direction.
 
              The CAMERA holds on the game for a few seconds and we
              SUPERIMPOSE:
 
                                       JULY 4, 1958
 
              The CHILDREN'S VOICES FADE slowly.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
         3    EXT. RIFLE RANGE - DAY
 
              ECU as a COUNSELLOR squeezes off a shot.
 
              The paper target is ripped in the black.
 
              The COUNSELLOR hands the weapon to a CAMPER who snaps in at the
              line.
 
              CLAUDETTE shouts up to the COUNSELLOR from the BG.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Have you seen Barry?
 
              The COUNSELLOR smiles.  Shrugs.

                                  COUNSELLOR
                      He and Chloe were at the Lodge last time
                      I saw him.
 
              CLAUDETTE leaves.  The COUNSELLOR smiles.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
         4    EXT. MAIN LODGE - DAY
 
              Two CHILDREN run by carrying Indian headdresses.  CLAUDETTE
              passes them impatiently as she sees BARRY and CHLOE.
 
              BARRY is leaning against the front rail of the porch, his arms
              behind his head--the better to show off his physique to CHLOE,
              and Assistant Counsellor, who is currently looking at him with
              cow eyes.  In the BG we can hear a portable radio blaring out
              an Everly Brothers hit.
 
              BARRY is 17, handsome and out for all he can get.  He is not
              ashamed for being caught with this other good-looking girl.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      We've got to talk.
 
              BARRY looks at CHLOE, then eases off the rail.  Nods.
 
                                  BARRY
                      Okay.
 
         5    BARRY puts an arms around CLAUDETTE, looks over his
              shoulder at CHLOE, and saunters off with the former.
 
              The Everly Brothers continue as we:
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
         6    EXT. LAKE - DAY
 
              From over the tops of a rack of canoes we see BARRY and
              CLAUDETTE walking along the shore.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      You said we were special.
 
                                  BARRY
                      I meant everything.
 
              In the BG, CHILDREN leap into the water.

                                  BARRY
                            (continuing)
                      You know what I said, though.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      I can't, Barry...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
         7    EXT. FOREST - DAY
 
              The TRACK goes SILENT.
 
              BARRY & CLAUDETTE walk along a path.  This is not an aimless
              walk, for BARRY knows exactly where he wants to go.  He leaves
              the path and goes to sit on a log in a small clearing.
              CLAUDETTE hesitates, then goes to sit next to him.
 
                                  BARRY
                      I care very much.
 
              He puts an arm around her and draws her close.  They kiss.
              They separate.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Does Chloe kiss as good as I do?
 
              BARRY decides to be politic.
 
                                  BARRY
                      I wouldn't know.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Oh, you...
 
              She kisses him and they are locked.
 
              A bird calls, wheels across the patch of sky above.
 
              The CAMERA shifts to ANOTHER ANGLE:  Just beyond the thicket of
              lacy vines.  It is a slow tracking shot which gives the
              impression that we are watching the action from the POV of
              another person, an unseen visitor...watching the two teen-aged
              Assistant Counsellors making their first sexual encounters.
 
              This unseen observer will be called the PROWLER.
 
              BARRY reaches up outside CLAUDETTE'S t-shirt to hold her
              breast.  She reaches up to take his hand away.
 
                                  BARRY
                      Claudette...

                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Somebody'll see.
 
                                  BARRY
                      No, they won't...
 
              He ends the argument by snaking his hand inside her t-shirt so
              that part of her bra is exposed.  He seals her protesting lips
              by kissing her.
 
              From the PROWLER's POV, the CAMERA MOVES to get a better angle.
              A hand moves into FRAME and pulls back some branches to clear
              the field of vision.  A branch pops.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                            (in a thick whisper)
                      Somebody's there, Barry.
 
                                  BARRY
                      Come on, Claudette.  A man's not made of
                      stone.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Let's go back, Barry...
 
                                  BARRY
                      I need you so much, Claudette.
 
              BARRY leans in and unhooks her bra.  They kiss again,
              passionately.
 
              The PROWLER pauses, then moves, never seen--except for a bit of
              foot or hand--from the POV of the CAMERA, closer and closer as
              the two TEENAGERS become more and more oblivious.
 
              Closer.  The THEME has snuck in.  It becomes discordant.  It
              swells.  Closer.
 
              QUICK CUT to BARRY & CLAUDETTE'S faces, their eyes closed, the
              perspiration streaking their flushed skin.
 
              Suddenly CLAUDETTE looks up into the CAMERA with terror.
 
              A hatchet flashes into FRAME and CLAUDETTE goes down under the
              blow.
 
              The CAMERA TURNS TO BARRY.  The PROWLER's powerful hand has him
              by the throat.  He backpeddles, trying to get away.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE: as BARRY is stopped against a tree.
 
              A hunting knife soars against the leafy sky.

              BARRY grabs the knife-hand at the wrist.  The knife falls to
              the mossy floor of the clearing.
 
              Two hands go for the free blade.  BARRY's hand has it.
 
              There is a confused jumble of struggle.
 
              Onto the bed of moss falls the little finger of the PROWLER.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  BARRY, horrified by the sight.
 
              The PROWLER's hand has the knife.  It moves quickly forward.
              We can hear the blade strike.
 
              BARRY stares up at the sky in a soundless shriek.
 
              MCU the moss where the finger fell.  The PROWLER reaches into
              FRAME, picks up the finger, and exits FRAME.
 
              QUICK CUT TO:  CHLOE, out searching for the missing Counsellors.
              She stands at the edge of the clearing, her hands pressed on her
              temples, her throat filled with a scream of terror.  The MUSIC
              has stopped abruptly.
 
              THE SCREEN BLEEDS TO WHITE.
 
              It is completely SILENT.

              The screen is completely black.  A small white shape starts to
              ZOOMS towards the FG.  The shape becomes a three-dimensional
              rendering of FRIDAY THE 13TH.  Just as it gets to its final
              position, the FRIDAY 13 logo shatters a previously unseen pane
              of glass.  There is a loud crash.  The logo shifts to the upper
              left corner of the FRAME as we ROLLS TITLES, white on black.
 
              The THEME MUSIC is a reprise of the THEME we heard during the
              Forest sequence, now done in a childlike arrangement.
 
              TITLES END and the MUSIC fades out.

              moves down the street past the GIRL in her late teens.  She has
              a knapsack, a freshly scrubbed face, jeans, and a plaid shirt.

              The regulars are there:  five MEN and two WOMEN who always come
              in for breakfast.  They are the retailers, the oil delivery
              man, the switchboard operators, and the cop.

              ANNIE's feet pound the hard-packed dirt.  She looks over her
              shoulder to see the Jeep.  The sun flares on the Jeep's
              windshield, keeping us from being able to see any details of
              the DRIVER.

              In a final desperate move, ANNIE drives into the underbrush to
              escape.
 
              The Jeep skids to a stop.

              The CAMERA becomes the DRIVER and chases into the thicket.
              Branches and briars snap back at us.  Just ahead, the terror-
              stuck ANNIE stumbles and falls.  She screams as a knife flashes
              past her in a blur.
 
              When the knife has passed, all we can see is a look of surprise
              on ANNIE's face.
 
              The CAMERA PULLS BACK.  Her throat has been cut.  She collapses
              out of FRAME.
 
              A bird soars across the sky above.
 
              The TRACK is SILENT.

              A gaily decorated camper-van travels along the highway.  We
              hear rock 'n roll OVER coming from a car radio as this much-in-
              need-of-repair vehicle passes a slower car.

        27    INT. CAMPER VAN - DAY
 
              In the camper van are three young people.  They are full of
              fun, fresh and expectant as they head towards Crystal Lake.
              They are instantly likeable.
 
              At the wheel is NED, a short 22-year-old whose well-developed
              upper body is a tribute to his weight-lifting.  He is nice-
              looking, a joker who is always trying to get some attraction.
              He is funny and alert.
 
              Next to him is JACK, an athlete whose clean-cut look is as
              American as popcorn.  He is quieter, two years younger and not
              as smart as NED.  He has to think things through.
 
              MARCIE is JACK's girlfriend.  She is leaning over the front
              passenger seat so she can messenger JACK's shoulders.

              She is a funny girl, pretty, and always looking for fun.  She
              enjoys every minute of every day.  She hasn't been touched by
              tragedy.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
 
                                  NED
                      There you are dead wrong.
 
                                  JACK
                      Ha!
 
                                  NED
                      Sometimes I only think about kissing
                      women.
 
              MARCIE finds a sore spot on JACK's back.
 
                                  JACK
                      Ow!
 
                                  NED
                      I was just wondering if you thought
                      there'd by any other gorgeous women at
                      Camp Crystal Lake.  Besides yourself.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      You are a true pierce of work, Ned.
 
              MARCIE hits NED on the arms, playfully.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      How about our last jay?
 
                                  JACK
                      Good call.
 
              JACK reaches into the glove compartment and comes out with a
              joint.
 
                                  NED
                      What about the dope paragraph in Mr.
                      Christy's letter?
 
                                  JACK
                      Quote:  Controlled substances are

                                  MARCIE
                      We got two weeks before the kids even
                      arrive.  Then I'll act responsibly.
                      Until then, hit me.
 
              She takes the lighted joint and tokes.

                                  NED
                      Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't
                      seen a coat of paint in six years.

              The CAMERA SEES what NED saw.  The buildings are run down at
              the heels.  It is the same camp we saw in the early scenes, but
              time has torn the place badly.
 
              The van passes the CAMERA and we see the three new ARRIVALS
              looking out the window.

              This is the main building.  It is the building where Barry and
              Claudette met.  Outside is a flagpole, a small parking area, a
              large overhanging tree.
 
              In the BG we can see part of the lake.

              In the FG there is a Jeep.

              An axe flashes through the FRAME and hacks apart the halves of
              a huge tree stump.
 
              The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a middle-aged man in cut-offs,
              a bare chest, hiking boots and beat-up cowboy hat.  This is
              STEVE CHRISTY.  He is strong, charming, and engaging.  He is
              animated, always in motion, impatient with how long it takes to
              do things.
 
              In the BG the van comes to a stop.  No sooner has JACK hopped
              down, than STEVE is beckoning him over.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Wanta give me a hand here?
 
              JACK smiles and comes quickly.

                            (continuing)
                      Alice?
 
              NED steps down from the van and now we can see that he has had
              polio when he was a kid.  His upper body is strong, but his
              legs are slightly deformed.  He and MARCIE hustle over to the
              big stump.
 
                                  STEVE
                            (continuing)
                      Wanta roll this sucker out of the way.
                      Alice?
 
              ALICE comes into the MS.  She is carrying a shovel and a bucket
              and has obviously been working for a couple of hours.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Cabin B is ready.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Push on this side.  Alice, this is Jack,
                      Marcie and Ned.  Push.
 
              They exchange "hellos" as they bend to the work.

                                  STEVE
                            (continuing)
                      That's got her.  Thanks.  I'm Steve
                      Christy.  Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake.
                      You got some grubby clothes?  Climb into
                      'em.  Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out
                      the boathouse.  I want him to start with
                      the canoes.  What happened to Brenda?
 
                                  ALICE
                      You told her to sweep the courts.
 
              STEVE sets off.
 
                                  STEVE
                      I'd rather she painted.  Let's go, folks.
 
              As soon as he's gone, NED turns to ALICE.
 
                                  NED
                      I thought we had two weeks...
 
              ALICE shrugs.
 
                                  ALICE
                      You can changed in three.

              The CAMERA looks down a long line of canoes, each with its hull
              up.  A brush slaps into view.  BILL is sweating while finishing
              a coat of paint on the last canoe.
 
              BILL is a thin, ascetic-looking college sophomore.  He rubs his
              long thin rose with the back of his wrist as he hears someone
              call his name OS.  He turns to see ALICE at the bottom of the
              trail.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Steve said for you to start on the boats.
 
                                  BILL
                      I finished the boats.
 
              ALICE nods slowly.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I'll tell him.
 
              She turns away.

                                  BILL
                      Alice?  The others show up?

                      Everybody except the girl who's supposed
                      to handle the kitchen.  Annie.
 
              BILL puts his brush in a coffee can of turps.
 
              ALICE look at him, then turns again.
 
                                  BILL
                      You think you're gonna last all summer?
 
                                  ALICE
                      I'm not sure I'll last all week.

              the wall.  On the other side MARCIE is scraping some flaking
              paint.

                      To answer your question, my parents once
                      owned this camp.  There were some tragic
                      accidents and they went bankrupt.  I
                      promised them I'd reopen if I could.

                      I'm behind schedule.  Let's go, Ned.
 
              They exit with the tool box.  MARCIE stops and turns to BRENDA,
              who looks upward and blows the hair from her forehead.

              STEVE, ALICE, BRENDA, MARCIE, NED, JACK and BILL are lugging a
              swimming float down to the water's edge.  STEVE supervises as
              he carries the thing, which is quite heavy.  They ad-lid as
              appropriate.  ("There goes my hernia." "Are you sure you're
              lifting?" "Not so fast." "I'm walking backward.")

              aboard for the ride, flipping into a handstand.

              whipped open quickly, letting in the full brightness of the
              sun.  There is a shape.
 
              The CAMERA IRISES DOWN so that we can see that JACK has come in
              on an errand.
 
              As JACK looks around, we can take the time to see that there
              are a half-dozen lantern, a few cans of lantern fuel, a couple
              of hibachis, some entrenching tools packs, portable ice chests,
              etc.  Up on the long side wall are a half-dozen hunting knives

              Suddenly a hand comes into FRAME and touches JACK on the
              shoulder as he is preoccupied with his task.  JACK turns with
              a start.  He looks into the CAMERA.

              REVERSE POV to see MARCIE standing in the doorway.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      What are those for?  An Indian raid?
 
              She points to the row of hatchets and knives.
 
                                  JACK
                      Steve's got a woodlore program.  You see
                      any life rings?
 
              MARCIE looks behind some piled up equipment.  She pulls out two
              rings.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Here.  Meet me in my cabin after taps.
                      Okay, Camper?
 
              She kisses him on the cheek and gives him a playful goose.
 
                                  JACK
                      For sure.
 
              They exit together.

              STEVE CHRISTY comes upon ALICE, who is renailing floorboards on
              the porch of the Arts & Crafts cabin.  On the railing is a
              sketch pad which Steve thumbs through.
 
              INSERT:  ALICE'S SKETCH.  It is a moody pierce, a sense of
              foreboding dominates it.  Otherwise, it is the camp's central
              compound, featuring the tree that forms the central focus.
 
                                  STEVE
                      You draw very well.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Oh, thanks.  I wish I could spend more
                      time at it.
 
              ALICE misses a nail and hits her thumb.  She reacts good-
              naturedly and keeps on working.
 
              STEVE bends down next to ALICE.
 
                                  STEVE
                      This isn't your cup of tea, hunh?
 
              She shakes her head.

                                  STEVE
                            (continuing)
                      Any particular reason?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Just a feeling.
                            (pause)
                      Nothing personal.
 
                                  STEVE
                            (nodding)
                      You want to leave?
 
                                  ALICE
                      I don't know.  Probably be best for
                      everybody.
 
                                  STEVE
                      You may not care a lot about this place,
                      Alice, but I mean to make it my whole
                      life.  It's been my whole life.  Gimme
                      a chance.  Stay a week.  Help get it
                      ready.  Next Friday, if you're not
                      happy, I'll put you on the bus myself.
                      I'll be grateful.
 
              He puts out a hand and runs the back of it across her cheek.
 
              She looks up.  She nods.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Next Friday.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Thanks, Alice.
 
              He stands up.

                            (continuing)
                      I've got to go to town and pick up the
                      trailer and all that other stuff, but
                      I'll be back around ten.  If you're
                      still up, we can talk, okay?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Sure.

              STEVE is at the wheel of his Jeep.  The COUNSELLORS are
              standing within earshot, huddled around the Jeep.
 
                                  JACK
                      You want it listed separately?

                      Yeah.  Brenda, after lunch hit the
                      archery range.  If Annie gets here, have
                      her start in on the kitchen.  Do your
                      best.  Tomorrow we have a preliminary
                      inspection by the state safety people.
                      I'd like to look good.
 
              He wheels the car around and out the driveway.  The others
              stand looking before NED breaks the silence.
 
                                  NED

                      called "Camp Blood" downtown.
 
              They are all getting back to work.

                                  NED
                      Late fifties sometime.  They never
                      caught the guy who did it either.

                      Neddy collects weird facts.  Next he is

              BRENDA has her sleeves rolled up and is doing her job.  She
              enjoys having the responsibility for the whole safe operation of
              this area.  She likes to think of herself as more sophisticated
              than she is--or have others think her more sophisticated.
 
              BRENDA rolls a straw target out from under the lean-to shelter
              and heads for a tripod in the middle distance.  There are
              already two such targets out, a product of her efforts so far.
              The targets are heavy.  This isn't an easy one-person job.
 
              The CAMERA CLOSES IN tighter and tighter on her as she gets
              closer to setting up the target.
 
              In MCU, she lifts a target up.  Her head is very close to the
              face of the target.  She gets it up, lets the tripod take the
              weight, and then, just as she lifts her weight back, an arrow
              streaks into the center of the gold, missing her head by
              eighteen inches.
 
              BRENDA whips around.
 
              WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  a very cocky NED, standing by the lean-
              to with a bow in his hands and three more arrows knocked
              simultaneously.  He has a feather stuck in his hair.
 
              She grabs the arrow and storms at him.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      You're crazy!
 
              She snaps the arrow in half.
 
                                  NED
                      Did anyone ever tell you you're
                      beautiful when you're angry?
 
                                  BRENDA

                      better.
 
              BRENDA still thinks he's a jerk, but he's so outrageous there's
              little she can do.  She laughs.
 
                                  BRENDA
                            (still laughing)
                      You ever fire one of those bows again,
                      and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.

                      God, but I love that sexy talk.
 
              BRENDA snatches the bow from him, shakes her head and puts the
              bow down next to a collection of wicked-looking arrows.

              This is a fairly large single room.  The walls are bare and
              uninsulated.  There are a few easels, but for the most part,
              the room is dominated by long tables and rough-hewn benches.
 
              The light seeps through the streaked windows, making the grey
              wood interior appear silver-colored.  ALICE, her hair in a
              bandana, has just finished sweeping up.
 
              The CAMERA picks up on ALICE's sketch of the central camp area
              on one easel.  On a second easel she has done the preliminary
              sketch of the lake itself.  It is also a moody picture.
 
              ALICE cocks her head to look at the sketches, shivers just a
              little, then goes on to her next task.  There is a row of newly-
              arrived cardboard boxes.  She opens the first in CU with a
              matte knife.  She take out the invoice and checks it against
              the first items:  gimp, the plastic string from which all the
              campers will make lanyards.

              ALICE snaps around, sensing that she is being watched.  In CU
              her frightened face looks at the sun-drenched dusty pane.  Her
              face relaxes until BANG!  The sound of a door slamming echoes
              through the room.
 
              The CAMERA ZOOMS BACK from her face to see someone standing in
              the doorway.
 
              It is BILL.

                                  BILL
                      Sorry.  How you doing?
 
              ALICE smiles, then turns back to her job of taking inventory.
              BILL watches her.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Did you want something?
 
              She starts to take a box down from a high shelf.  She doesn't
              realize that there is something on top of the box.
 
                                  BILL
                      Steve said you were thinking of leaving.

              A LONG WIDE SHOT reveals the cool, clear lake during the lull

              At the edge of the lake, in the shallows, are the members of
              the group:  MARCIE, JACK, NED, BRENDA, BILL and ALICE.  They
              are sitting or paddling or diving off the float.  There is no
              real attempt to exert too much energy.
 
              Gradually we become aware that this LONG WIDE SHOT is someone's
              POV.  The CAMERA moves from its stable position, now hand-held,
              on a trajectory around the side of the lake, out of sight.
 
              Branches, brush, and twigs are butted through.  Occasionally,
              we can see part of the PROWLER's arm fending off the underbrush.

              ALICE is treading water, talking with BRENDA, as NED comes up
              out of nowhere.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Vitamin C's supposed to neutralize the
                      nitrites or something.
 
              NED surfaces between them.  He looks with googly eyes at ALICE.
 
                                  NED
                      There are sand sharks in this lake and
                      they can eat the bathing suit right off
                      you.
 
              ALICE laughs.

                            (continuing)
                      See?  I'm getting to you.  Very slowly.
 
              NED does a porpoise drive and disappears.
 
              BRENDA is not laughing.  She is looking off towards the cabin
              area.
 
              ALICE sees her and look where she looks.
 
                                  ALICE
                      What'd you see?
 
                                  BRENDA
                      I don't know.  Marcie's got me paranoid.
 
              She smiles.

        48    EXT. BEHIND ALICE'S CABIN - DAY
 
              The CAMERA, shooting from the PROWLER's POV, moves to a place
              alongside Alice's cabin.  There is underbrush about two feet
              tall and all around that area.  The PROWLER stops, leans down
              and reaches into FRAME with a gloved hand.
 
              The gloved hand reaches into the underbrush for the tip of a
              burlap bag which has been secreted there.  The hand lifts the
              bag, which has something in it that moves.
 
              The CAMERA MOVES around to the side of the cabin right below
              the window.  The window is open, making entry quite simple.

              The PROWLER's gloved hands untie the neck of the bag, reach in
              and haul out quickly a medium-sized snake.  One hand has the
              animal firmly behind the jaws.  The hand takes the snake and
              puts it through the open window, leaving it on the clean white
              coverlet.  It slithers across the bed.
 
              The PROWLER's hand closes the window.
 
              The CAMERA MOVES towards one of the sheds.

              BILL and ALICE are lying on the shore on their towels, watching
              the OTHERS in the water and grabbing some afternoon sun.  ALICE
              is on her stomach, tracing angular designs in the sand.  BILL
              is on his back, listening.
 
                                  BILL
                      It still hurts?
 
                                  ALICE
                      I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt,
                      but I thought I could stand anything.
                            (pause)
                      I just wasn't ready for that kind of
                      pain.  We were supposed to meet in L.A.
                      When I got back there, he sent a telegram
                      saying he was going back to his wife.
 
              BILL turns over so he can look at her better.
 
                                  BILL
                      What'll you do when you leave here?
 
                                  ALICE
                      I don't know.
 
              Various feet enter the FRAME.  BILL and ALICE look up to see
              JACK with his arm around MARCIE, NED toweling his head, and
              BRENDA putting on her blue workshirt.

                      Pistachio, fudge ripple, creme de menthe
                      and I are going back to work.
 
              BILL gets up.
 
                                  BILL
                      Speaking as black raspberry, I guess I'm
                      ready.  Frozen yogurt?

              ALICE smiles at the reference.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I'll be along.

              Set up behind the cabin is a make-shift exercise area.  There
              are chinning bars--pipeslashed between two trees--and there's
              an aging set of parallel bars.  There is even a set of weights
              made from tin cans, pipes and assorted amount of cement.

              We PULL BACK to see BRENDA watching NED work out on the uneven
              parallel bars.  He is really very good and there is no doubt
              about his strength.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Not bad.
 
              As NED moves off the apparatus, BRENDA comes in and does a neat
              little turn which is dazzling.  NED does a take.

                      Alice?
 
              She stops and look down at him.  He is serious and he cares.

              ALICE appreciates what's she's just heard.  She knows that it
              wasn't easy for BILL to say.
 
                                  ALICE
                      You're very nice.

                      Hope you will.
 
              BILL smiles and turns and jogs off, still carrying his long
              blade.
 
              ALICE watches him go.  She shrugs.  This might be a good place
              to stay.  She turns and goes into her cabin.

              In the FG is the camp bed with its white coverlet.  The snake
              is nowhere in sight--which means it could be anywhere.
 
              ALICE is humming to herself and is happier now than she has
              been since we met her.
 
              The room is small.  There is the metal-frame cot, an old wooden
              dresser with a cloudy mirror on top.  The walls are a light
              blue, freshly painted.  The wall on the inside does not go all
              the way to the ceiling so that she can monitor what's going on
              in the campers' section of the cabin on the other side.
 
              ALICE looks at herself in the old cloudy mirror and likes what
              she sees.  She pushes her hair so that she looks a little
              sexier.  She smiles at herself.
 
              She reaches out in CU.  Open a drawer.  Takes out a towel.
 
              ALICE turns and goes to her footlocker.  Bends down and opens
              it up.  Takes out a terrycloth robe.
 
              She closes the footlocker, stands up and heads out the door.

              her hairbrush.  She takes her towel off and lets her tangled
              hair fall down.
 
              She hums.  Opens her top drawer.  Nothing there.
 
              Opens the next drawer.  Nothing there.
 
              Opens the next drawer.  Nothing there.
 
              ALICE opens the fourth drawer and the snake strikes!  It flails
              at her right wrist, a wrist which we have established earlier
              as having a Navajo bracelet on it.  The snake strikes the
              bracelet, hangs on as ALICE tries to shake it free.  The snake
              falls to the floor and recoils for another attack.
 
              There is no way that ALICE can get past the snake to run away.
              Her scream is loud.

                      There's a fucking snake in here.

              BILL sees it.  He freezes, then takes a step forward.
              Carefully, he winds up and smashes down with the edge of the
              machete, cutting the snake into two pieces.  Blood spurts onto
              the floor.
 
              MARCIE and JACK enter.  JACK carries a shovel as a weapon.
              MARCIE stops when she sees the embrace, but then looks further

                      Slipped in.  Probably liked the scent of
                      your perfume.
 
              JACK return and tosses a roll to MARCIE.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Thanks.
 
                                  BILL
                      You okay now?
 
              ALICE nods.
 
              BILL gives her an extra hug.  Then steps back awkwardly,
              stepping on MARCIE's big toe.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Go ahead.  I walk on 'em all the time.
                            (to JACK)
                      Would you shovel Mr. Snake outta here?
 
              JACK nods.  He picks up his shovel and we see in CU as he gets
              underneath the wide-fanged snake.
 
              MARCIE begins to clean the blood off the floor with the paper
              toweling.

        59    EXT. CAMP - LATE AFTERNOON
 
              Looking across the lake, we can see the camp, nestled in among
              the late afternoon rays of the sun.  We can hear the sounds of
              the nocturnal animals beginning to rise and hunt.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        60    INT. CAMP KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON
 
              The kitchen and the main meeting room are really one in the
              same room, cut off by a partition.  The kitchen has a couple of
              sinks, a heavy old stove, long shelves, a pantry/larder, and
              some windows which look out on the rear.
 
              BRENDA is making a salad for herself.  She is a vegetarian.
              MARCIE is making a guacamole dip.
 
              In the big room there is a fireplace and a ping pong table.
              JACK and BILL are playing.
 
                           BRENDA                        JACK
                   She all right?                Get ready for the schneider.
 
                           MARCIE                        BILL
                   Yeah.  Scared the hell out    No chance.
                   of her.

                   How'd it get in the drawer?
 
              ALICE walks into the kitchen.  She has washed her face after
              getting her act together.  She stands in the doorway to the
              kitchen.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      How you doin'?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Okay.  Can I help?
 
                                  BRENDA
                      It's catch as catch can.  I'm making a
                      salad.  The guys are planning to cook
                      greaseburgers for themselves.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      There's a lot of dishes if you just want
                      something to do.
 
              ALICE smiles.  Nods.

                                  ALICE
                      The way I feel, that's perfect.
 
              ALICE goes to the sink and begins to work her way through the
              dirty dish pan.
 
              NED comes flying through the door dressed in various bits and
              pieces of old Indian costumery.  He does a bad dance.
 
              JACK and BILL quit their game and come to the doorway.
 
                           JACK                          BILL
                   What the hell?                Where'd you get that stuff?
 
                           MARCIE                        BRENDA
                   Oh, Lord!                     Neddy!

                      goodies in the shed.  I also found this
                      letter which a camper never sent home.
                      Listen.
 
              He takes a letter out of his breechclout.  He pretends to read,
              when really we can see that the paper is blank.

                      night and sucks our counsellor's body...
 
              ALICE leans against the sink and laughs.  She is a very pretty
              girl, younger than she first appeared.

                      He says that whenever I'm scared, I can
                      sleep in his bunk with him.
 
              JACK and BILL laugh.
 
              NED takes off his headdress.

              ALICE looks up from her dishes and cocks her head to the side.
              Does she sees something?
 
              The CAMERA PANS SLOWLY to look over her shoulder.
 
              The window pane is dirty and it's a bit difficult to see, but
              there is something standing there out by a cabin.  But it
              stands, doesn't move... Is it a building?
 
              CUT AWAY to see ALICE using her dishcloth to clear the glass.
              When we CUT BACK, the shape is gone.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE.  Curious.  A cold chill...
 
              ALICE looks around at the others who are still adlibbing about
              food.

              ALICE looks up.  Pulls the light cord in the middle of the room.
 
              The bulb does not light.
 
              ALICE pulls it again.

                      Give me a hand?

        61    INT. GENERATOR SHED - LATE AFTERNOON
 
              JACK steps in and, in CU, we see there is a puddle where he is
              standing.  The puddle is somehow significant.
 
              BILL leans over JACK's shoulder to see what he's doing.
 
                                  BILL
                      This is almost like the one at my
                      uncle's cabin in Maine.
 
                                  JACK
                      Here we go.
 
              The CAMERA watches JACK's actions tightly.  In a REVERSE POV we
              see JACK's tongue come out the side of his mouth as he
              concentrates.  He bites down on it.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  as JACK pulls the starter cord.  The engine
              roars into action.
 
                                  JACK
                            (yelling)
                      Now ya' close the switch.
 
              CU as JACK's hand reaches in and touches a heavy-duty metal
              switch.  A spark arcs and we PULL BACK to see JACK with a
              perfect connection running through his body.  There is a
              sparking sound, the little light in the shed blinks, JACK
              screams, the generator chugs roughly.  Hundreds of volts are
              streaking through JACK's body and grounded through his wet
              shoes.
 
              BILL reacts quickly:  knowing better than to touch him and
              continue the connection, he takes a half-step backwards, aims
              at an oblique angle and executes a perfect Bruce Lee-type drop-
              kick on his friend, severing the contact.

              JACK stumbles out of the shack and the light goes dead.  The
              machine stops.

              JACK lands, almost unconscious.  BILL kneels into FRAME and
              cheeks JACK's vital sign:  his eyes, his carotid pulse, his
              breathing.
 
              JACK shakes his head.
 
                                  JACK
                      I'll be okay.  Holy shit...
 
                                  BILL
                      Don't get up.  Take a second...
 
              JACK lies back down.  Covers his eyes with his arm.
 
                                  JACK
                      You saved my life.
 
                                  BILL
                      I had to.
 
                                  JACK
                      Thanks.
 
                                  BILL
                      I figured if I didn't save you.  I'd
                      have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that
                      would have ruined my appetite.
 
              JACKS looks up and smiles.  BILL give him a hand and the groggy
              athlete gets to his feet.
 
                                  JACK
                      Whew.
 
              Satisfied that JACK won't fall down, BILL goes to the shed and
              looks in.
 
              We can look in over BILL's shoulder and see a smoke-scarred
              switch and a now-silent generator.
 
                                  BILL
                      This puddle was enough to ground you all
                      the way to China.
 
              JACK looks in, too.

                                  JACK
                      Floor probably leaks.  This area is full
                      of springs.
 
                                  BILL
                      A short somewhere.
 
              BILL leans down and sees a smokey-colored wire that touches
              another wire.
 
                                  BILL
                            (continuing)
                      There's the problem, Jack.  Wire worked
                      itself loose.
 
              He starts to wind it round a set-screw in CU.
 
                                  JACK
                      Just in cause this bugger goes bad.  I'm
                      gonna pick up some lanterns from the

              The door opens at us, letting in the limited light.  JACK comes
              in and goes to pick up a fluorescent lamp.  He flicks it on.
              As he bends down to pick up two Coleman lanterns, the CAMERA
              slowly moves toward the wall where once we saw all the hatchets
              and knives.  They are all missing.
 
              JACK takes his booty and exits.
 
              The light is gone and we are alone in the dark.

                      Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
 
              ALICE listens as she washes the dishes.  It looks as if things
              will be okay.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Shows how much you know.  It's something
                      about tomorrow.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Tomorrow is another day.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Right!  Right!
 
              MARCIE is finishing up making her green California dip.
 
              Suddenly ALICE cries out.  Everybody whips around to see.
              ALICE holds up a piece of broken glass--the bottom half of a
              bottle.  She has cut her finger.  It is not a serious cut, but
              the blood is visible.
 
                                  ALICE
                      This just plain ain't my day.
 
              BILL reaches into a cupboard and pulls out a BandAid.
 
                           MARCIE                        NED
                   You okay?                     Those things can be nasty.
 
                           BRENDA
                   Wash it out real good.
 
              BILL comes up to ALICE.
 
                                  BILL
                      Lemme see.  Doesn't look too bad.
 
              That said, the OTHERS go back to what they were doing.
 
              BILL and ALICE are featured even though we can hear the others.
              BILL takes great care and puts the BandAid on ALICE's finger.

              They share this moment with soft smiles as the trivia contest
              continues.
 
                                  NED
                      Who played the role of Gorgon in Star
                      Trek?
 
                           BILL                          BRENDA
                   I don't want you getting      Melvin Belli.
                   hurt.
                                                         NED
                           ALICE                 Aaaargh!  That my
                   I was careless.               guaranteed winner!
 
                           BILL                          MARCIE
                   How'd it get in there?        Melvin Belli?
 
                           ALICE
                   Somebody probably dropped
                   something too hard.
 
                                  NED
                      Alice, you're just lucky there are no
                      snakes in the dishwater here.
 
              NEDDY is hovering over a bowl of California dip which MARCIE
              has just made.  He dips a chip as soon as she steps back.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Soooooeeeeey, piggy, piggy.
 
              Suddenly NED's face goes red.  His eyes bulge out.  He grabs
              his throat and gags.  Coughs, can't clear it.
 
                                  JACK
                      What is it?
 
                                  BILL
                      Is it stuck?
 
              NED points to the dip and slumps down on the floor where he
              writhes about.
 
                           MARCIE                        ALICE
                   Help him!                     Oh, my God!
 
                           BILL                          JACK
                   Roll him over!                Get behind him more.
 
              As BILL and JACK flip him over to try to give him the Heimlich,
              NED stops his act and grins from ear to ear.  It's a big finish:
 
                                  NED
                      Ta-da!

              REACTION SHOTS: as it sinks in that NED has been putting them on.
 
                                  JACK
                      Not funny, Ned...
 
              BILL stands up, angry, but willing to keep his mouth shut.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Wait'll you're really in trouble and see
                      what happens...
 
                                  NED
                      But it's in the brochure!  "Camp Crystal
                      Lake has a full drama program."  You
                      just saw it.
 
              NED tries to laugh it off.  They shake their heads.  MARCIE
              walks away.  JACK looks at BILL.
 
                                  BILL
                      Chance to get even?
 
                                  JACK
                      I'll spot you five points.
 
                                  NED
                      Hey, look, I'm sorry.  I'll never do it
                      again.
 
              NED turns and heads for the door.  ALICE comes up next to him.
              The OTHERS are out of earshot now.  BILL and JACK play a little
              ping-pong.  NED is a little embarrassed by his play-acting
              stunt.
 
                                  NED
                            (continuing)
                      I'm sorry.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Ned?  We're gonna be working together
                      for a while.  You're a nice guy without
                      all the entertainment, okay?
 
              NED relaxes.  Nods.  He knows what she means.  He turns to look
              at the others.
 
                                  NED
                      Tell 'em I'm sorry?
 
              ALICE nods.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Sure.

                                  NED
                      I'm gonna go lie down and catch some
                      z's.  Today wiped me out.
                            (pause)
                      Thanks, Alice.
 
                                  ALICE
                      You're welcome.
 
              The CAMERA stays on ALICE's face as NED exits.  In the BG,
              MARCIE speaks.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I hope that's the last time we see the
                      Camp Crystal Lake Drama Program.

        65    EXT. MAIN CAMP AREA - EVENING
 
              We watch NED come away from the main cabin and walk moodily
              toward his cabin.
 
              The CAMERA stays with the troubled child as he stops, leans
              down, picks up a pebble and skips it off into the brush.  It
              cuts through.  He flips a few stones in his hand.
 
              NED looks off.  Sees something.
 
              WE SEE WHAT HE SEES:  a shape--a human shape--standing by a
              cabin.
 
              NED walks towards it.
 
                                  NED
                      Hello?  Can I help you?
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        66    INT. KITCHEN AREA - EVENING
 
              ALICE is just drying her hands.  She stands next to a giant
              stack of clean dishes and pots.
 
              BRENDA is reading a magazine while picking at some cauliflower
              and cucumber slices.
 
              BILL and JACK saunter in.
 
                                  JACK
                      You just had some lucky shots.

                                  BILL
                      Where's Ned?
 
                                  ALICE
                      He went to bed early.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I don't blame him.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      He's probably setting up another one of
                      his practical jokes.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Yeah, like draining the lake!
 
              They laugh.
 
                                  JACK
                            (to MARCIE)
                      Hey, how about a walk by the lake?
 
              The OTHERS all go "Ooooooooh."
 
                                  JACK
                            (continuing)
                      Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (kidding)
                      Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy
                      small-minded people around here.
                            (to JACK)
                      Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and
                      be right with you.
 
              MARCIE puts an arm through JACK's arm and they exit.
 
              The OTHERS laugh.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        67    EXT. EDGE OF LAKE - NIGHT
 
              JACK and MARCIE walk across the pint needles towards the lake.
              There is the low rumble of thunder preceeded by a faint glow on
              the horizon.
 
              JACK and MARCIE walk along the shore to the lake.  They have
              turned on the flashlights which they carry with them.

                                  JACK
                      Wind's up.  It's shifted a good hundred
                      and eighty degrees.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
 
                                  JACK
                      I love you.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I love you.
 
              They kiss.  MARCIE pulls back.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      What about Neddy?
 
                                  JACK
                      I don't love Neddy.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
 
                                  JACK
                            (yelling)
                      Ned!
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Don't call him.
 
                                  JACK
                      I thought you wanted to give him one of
                      your motherly lectures.  Ned is gonna do
                      whatever he wants to do, you know.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I guess...
 
              The moon is victim of a blank cloud which cuts off the light.
 
                                  JACK
                      Looks like a storm.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I'm a little scared of storms.  Always
                      have been.  Since I was a kid.
 
                                  JACK
                      You?  The brick?
 
              JACK shines the flashlight so that we can see her face in eerie
              shadows.  She flashes hers at him.

                                  MARCIE
                      I've dreamed this dream.  Maybe half a
                      dozen times.  There is a thunderstorm.
                      The rain comes down like pebbles.  I can
                      hear the sound.  I try to close my ears
                      off.  It doesn't work.  The sounds gets
                      louder.  The rain turns to blood and the
                      blood washes down in little rivers.  And
                      the sound stops.
 
              A loud crack of heat lightning slices the sky apart.  MARCIE is
              startled and reaches out for her lover.
 
                                  JACK
                      It's just a dream.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I call it my shower dream.
 
              They look at one another in the two lights.  They grin.  Rain
              drops begin to fall on their faces and on the lake behind them.
 
                                  JACK
                      This is no dream.  Want to escape for a
                      while?
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Lead the way!
 
              JACK turns and jogs toward the nearest cabin.  MARCIE is only
              a half step behind, laughing.
 
              FROM A DISTANT ANGLE we watch them run.  There is no theme,
              just the rumble of thunder...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        68    INT. BOY'S CABIN - NIGHT
 
              The door bursts open, a flashlight pierces the shadows, and
              JACK and MARCIE rush in and plop on the bottom bunk of the
              nearest bed.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Are you wet?
 
                                  JACK
                      Just a little.  Wait a minute, woman.
 
              He reaches down and put his flashlight on its end so it points
              straight up and gives them some light to see by.

              They go into a long passionate kiss which is broken by MARCIE's
              hand coming up from behind JACK and tugging his t-shirt up
              towards his head.  He leans back and takes it off, and tosses
              it at the CAMERA.

        69    EXT. FRONT OF MAIN CABIN - NIGHT
 
              The rain has gathered in intensity.  ALICE comes up to the
              front door and looks out.  BILL comes up behind her.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
 
                                  BILL
                      Not if they're where I think they are.
 
              ALICE laughs.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I'm not always this stupid.
 
              She turned back into the cabin.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        70    INT. BOY'S CABIN - NIGHT
 
              TIGHT on JACK and MARCIE as they make love under a camp
              blanket.  Their breathing and noises are heard just above the
              sounds of the rain outside.
 
              The CAMERA becomes interested in a droplet which appear to have
              leaked from the ceiling, hit the vertical member of the bed and
              dribbled down.  As the bed shakes with its love-making, the
              CAMERA PANS up the bunk's strut to trace the droplet's course.
 
              As the CAMERA PANS UPWARD, it pulls back slightly and we see
              NED lying in the upper bunk.  In a flash of lightning we
              realize he is dead:  his throat has been slashed.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  JACK and MARCIE lie completely still beneath
              their blanket.  The CAMERA PANS along their quiet bodies.
              MARCIE's face is contented.  JACK is ready to doze off.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Mmmmmmmph?
 
                                  JACK
                      Mmmmmmmph.

                                  MARCIE
                      Best over...
 
                                  JACK
                      Umhummmmph.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Like waves.  It's never been likes waves
                      before.
 
                                  JACK
                      Whassamatta?
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Gotta pee.  You're lying on my bladder.
 
              She rolls over and grabs her underpants and t-shirt.  While
              still on the bottom bunk, she puts herself into her limited
              clothing.  JACK gives her room.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (dressing)
                      I know this ain't very romantic, but
                      what can I say?  I don't want to explode.
 
              She grabs a flashlight, scoots to the door and is gone.
 
              JACK lies back and puts his hands under his hand.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        71    EXT. CAMP GROUNDS - NIGHT
 
              MARCIE runs across the now-wet central area towards the
              bathroom facility.  She tries to skip between the raindrops,
              but she knows she'll get a drenching.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        72    INT. BOY'S CABIN - NIGHT
 
              JACK rolls to his side, picks up a small hand-rolled cigarette
              and lights it.  He inhales deeply, rolls on his back.
              Something overhead catches his eye.
 
              Across the way from the row of toilet stalls is a row of shower
              stalls, and further down is a row of several sinks and mirrors.
              We hear the toilet flush.
 
              We CUT INSIDE the toilet booth as MARCIE stands reading the
              graffiti to herself.  We can only see her from the chest up.

                                  MARCIE
                            (reading)
                      "Forty yards to the outhouse by Willie
                      Makit."  "The Yellow Stream by I.P.
                      Daley."  Not the most original stuff,
                      kids.
 
              There is a noise outside the stall.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Jack?
 
              She hears no response and assumes that her imagination is
              playing tricks with her.  MARCIE picks up the flashlight and
              exits the stall.
 
        73    MARCIE crosses to the row of sinks, stops, puts the
              flashlight down and turns on the water faucet.  There is
              no water.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              PROWLER'S POV:  of MARCIE.
 
              From the end of the row of showers, we watch MARCIE bend under
              the sink and turn on one of the spigots.  Water rushes into the
              sink.
 
        74    MCU MARCIE:  She rinses her hands, shakes them dry and
              turns off the water.  Again she hears a noise.  She looks
              to the row of showers and smiles.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Jack?
 
              The screen door to the shower room is swinging open and shut.
 
              MARCIE looks over, smiles.  She thinks someone is trying to
              scare her.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Jack?  Neddy?  Don't put me on.
 
              There is a dripping sound.  MARCIE stops at the first shower,
              hesitates.
 
              Throws back the first curtain.  There is no one there.  She
              reaches in and makes sure the spigot is really off.
 
              She goes to the second shower, looks over her shoulder to the
              empty toilet.  Then reaches in to the shower curtain.

                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Allee allee infree!
 
              She throws back the curtain.  Again no one is there.
 
              She breathes a sigh of disappointment.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Must be my imagination.
 
              In CU she turns back toward the sink area when suddenly the
              TRACK explodes with a MUSICAL STINGER.  It happens in a flash.
              A shape lunges from the toilet booth across from the first
              shower.  A hatchet glints.  MARCIE screams.  The hatchet
              strikes.  The flashlight clatters to the floor.

              The sound of a cash register ringing up a sale hangs over an
              establishing shot of the diner.  Through the window, which are
              being pelted with rain, we can see a WAITRESS and some CUSTOMERS
              seated on stools at the counter.

        76    INT. DINER - NIGHT
 
              The WAITRESS is different from the morning woman, slightly
              older, but still attractive.  She says good night to her
              CUSTOMER, who finishes paying his bill and crosses down the
              counter.  Seated there is STEVE CHRISTY, finishing his cup of
              coffee.  The waitress, SANDY, picks up his empty pie plate and
              tosses it in a pan of other dirty dishes.
 
                                  SANDY
                      Anything else you want?
 
                                  STEVE
                      No, thanks.  I'm fine.  Sandy.
 
                                  SANDY
                      You can't go back there tonight.  Not in
                      that stuff.  'Less you wanta get drownded.

                            (drinking quickly)
                      I got to.

                                  SANDY
                      Aw.
 
              SANDY likes STEVE and enjoys flirting with him.
 
                                  STEVE
                      I have six new counsellor up there.
                      They're all babes in the woods in every
                      sense of the word.
 
                                  SANDY
                      They'll be okay if they know enough to
                      stay in outta the rain.
 
 
                      How much do I owe you?
 
                                  SANDY
                      One night on the town.
 
                                  STEVE
                      I mean...
 
                                  SANDY
                      ...I know what you mean.  Two and a
                      quarter.  Plus fifteen percent tip to
                      make up for me spending the night alone.
 
              STEVE pays up and walks to the cash register.
 
                                  SANDY
                            (continuing)
                      You got a roof for that Jeep?
 
              She rings up the money.  Gives him his change.  He hands her a
              tip.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Yeah.  I got it on before this--
                            (indicates the storm outside)
                      --all started.
 
                                  SANDY
                      That's thirty percent.
 
                                  STEVE
                      For two lonely nights.
 
              She smiles and is really kind of pretty underneath all that
              extra makeup.
 
                                  SANDY
                      Drive careful and don't drownd your dumb
                      self.

              STEVE smiles and leaves.  She watches, then counts her changes
              and sticks it her pocket with the rest of her tips for the day.

              and starts it up.  He roars off through a big puddle, splashing

                      Anything's possible.  My parents taught
                      me to leave sleeping lovers alone.
 
                                  ALICE
                      It wouldn't matter except Steve should be
                      getting back pretty soon.  It wouldn't
                      look so great if he fell over them.

                                  BILL
                      Good point.

                      Long enough for me.
 
              They laugh.

                      I think we should go wake them up.  Just

                      Give them a little while longer.  It's

              From his POV we watch the windshield wipers struggle to stay
              ahead of the rain.  Beyond them the headlights make a slight

              In the BG we hear a country station on the radio, but it is
              bringing in more static than music, owing to the electrical

                                  BILL
                      Got to it just in time.  The generator
                      was running on fumes.  I filled it up.
                      That should keep it humming until Steve
                      gets back.
 
              BRENDA gets up.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Good night, Alice.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Good night, Brenda.
 
              BRENDA takes her lantern, and, throwing the slicker over her
              head like a portable tent, she races off into the night.
 
              ALICE watches her go.  A glimmer of lightning outlines her as
              she heads off.
 
              BILL walks back into the big room, followed by ALICE.
 
                                  BILL
                      Help you clean up?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Absolutely.
 
 
 
              She walks with him as he carries the tray of empty coffee cups
              into the kitchen.

              The door opens and BRENDA comes in with her lantern and
              slicker.  Her actions are direct and business-like.
 
              BRENDA goes first to the row of sinks and looked at herself in
              the mirror, holding up a propane Coleman lantern like an
              examination lamp.  She takes out a toothbrush and some other
              toilet articles.
 
              She flips on both faucets and nothing comes out.  She put her
              lantern down on the floor and turns on the water valves.  She
              stands up, and washes her hands and face.

              She turns off the faucets and now we hear the dripping sound
              that Marcie had heard.  BRENDA looks off at the shower stalls,
              shrugs, picks up her lantern and makes her exit.

              STEVE's Jeep coughs, sputters, stalls.  OVER we can hear him

              He looks up to see headlights coming at him in his rear view
              mirror.
 
              STEVE, wearing a yellow slicker, gets out of the Jeep to try to
              flag down the oncoming car.

              STEVE smiles to see that the oncoming car is the local police
              car, driven by a middle-aged cop named TIERNEY.  TIERNEY has
              the window down already.
 
                                  TIERNEY
                      I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
 
                                  STEVE
                      I think water got into the electrical
                      system.  You ride me back to camp?  I'll
                      get one of my counsellors to drive me
                      back tomorrow morning.
 
                                  TIERNEY
                      Why not?
 
              STEVE is around the car and hopping in almost before TIERNEY
              can answer.
 
                                  TIERNEY

              He puts the car in gear and roars into the night.

              Under a single hanging lightbulb, BRENDA finishes writing at a
              small table.
 
              The weather howls outside.  There's a tapping sound.  BRENDA
              looks up.  Listens, yawns, then gets up and starts to take off
              her clothes.

                                  BRENDA
                      That could drive a person bug-city.
 
              The SOUND is apparently coming from the front of the cabin;
              perhaps she can fix it without getting too wet.
 
              BRENDA grabs her slicker and heads out.
 
              The CAMERA FOLLOWS BRENDA through the darkened cabin to the
              front door.

              There is a small roof overhang like a porch, affording some
              protection from the wind and wet.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSER:  as BRENDA hears the tapping sound
              closer by.  She looks and sees.
 
              WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  somebody has ties a kitchen knife to a
              string and left it dangling from the eaves.  The wind blows,
              making the knife tap against the building.

                                  BRENDA
                      Neddy?  Cut the screwing around, Neddy!
 
              She grabs the knife, breaking the string.
 
                                  BRENDA
                            (continuing)
                      This isn't even half funny.
 
              Angry, BRENDA turns and goes back inside the cabin.

                      Christ, what a jerk.
 
              The single bulb goes out.

                      Great.  Now what?
 
              BRENDA crosses to the table, puts down her knife and strikes a
              match.  She fires up the propane lantern.
 
                                  BRENDA
                            (continuing)
                      Looks like I turn in early.
 
              She moves the lamp and gets ready to climb into her bed.  She
              reaches down and takes the coverlet and tugs it clear,
              revealing something that has been left there.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  Fear spreads across her face.
 
              REVERSE POV:  WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  A camp hatchet lies across
              her pillow.  The shiny blade is marked with blood.

              runs out of the light into the darkness and underbrush behind
              third base.  The CAMERA slowly zooms in on the darkness where
              BRENDA exited.  We hold on that spot for several seconds.
              Finally the silence is broken by a terrified scream.  Then
              another.

       101    EXT. GIRL'S CABIN - NIGHT
 
              BILL and ALICE have made their way to BRENDA's cabin.  From the
              outside they can see the Coleman lantern burning on the table
              within.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Brenda?  Brenda?  You there?
 
              There is no response.  The CAMERA stays in a MCU of ALICE as
              she and BILL cross up the stairs and into the cabin.

              The SHOT continues on ALICE as she looks about the empty cabin.
              Finally she stops, looking down.  The CAMERA continues to hold
              on her face.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Bill.
 
              BILL crosses over to ALICE.  They are both looking down, past
              the CAMERA LENS.

              ANOTHER ANGLE:  WE SEE WHAT THEY SEE:  the bloody hatchet left
              on Brenda's pillow.
 
              ANGLE on BILL and ALICE:  (as before).  Their faces are serious.

              The rain slants down as BILL and ALICE make their way towards
              Jack's cabin.  They go to the door.  BILL knocks.
 
                                  BILL
                      Jack?

                      Hey, guys!
 
              BILL opens the door to the cabin.

              The door opens at us.  We see the silhouetted figures of BILL
              and ALICE.  BILL flips on the light switch.
 
              The cabin is empty.  Jack's backpack lies on the bed, the
              contents neatly laid out.

              It is dark inside.  The door slams open at us as BILL and ALICE

                                  ALICE
                      Marcie?  Brenda?  Jack?
 
              BILL walks slowly towards the row of toilets and showers.

                                  ALICE
                            (continuing)
                      I think we should call the police, Bill.
 
              BILL, who was just about to open one of the toilet stalls, nods
              and turns back to ALICE.
 
                                  BILL
                      Okay.
 
              They exit.  There is a beat... and then a slickered shape
              passes between us and the night sky light which comes through
              the windows.  The shape is dragging something.

       106    EXT. OFFICE CABIN - NIGHT
 
              ALICE and BILL are on the porch of one of the cabins.  To the
              left of the door is a small sign that reads:  "Office."  BILL
              tries the door, but cannot open it.
 
                                  BILL
                      Sucker's locked.  Who's got the key?
 
              ALICE ignores the question, bends down beside the cabin and
              comes up with a short 2x4.  She crosses to the door and smashes
              through one of the window panes.  She puts her arm through the
              broken glass, unlocks the door and enters.  BILL follows.
 
              The CAMERA continues to watch them from outside the cabin.
              They turn on a light and cross to a phone on Steve Christy's
              desk.  BILL picks up the receiver, listens, clicks the switch
              on the desk set several times.
 
                                  BILL
                            (continuing)
                      It's dead.  Try the pay phone.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Do you have a dime?  A quarter?
 
                                  BILL
                      No.  There must be some in the desk
                      somewhere.
 
              They fumble through the desk to find some change.  BILL finds
              some in the postage drawer.  He then crosses over to a pay
              phone mounted on the wall.  The CAMERA moves to the cornice of
              the building where the phone line exits.  It follows the link
              up the side of the cabin to the junction where the power and
              phone lines come in from the pole.  Here we see a dangling
              phone cable which has been recently cut.

              OVER, we hear the sound of a quarter dropping in the dead
              telephone.
 
                                  ALICE (V.O.)

                      too.

              BILL slides behind the wheel.  The keys are in the ignition.
              ALICE hops in on the passenger side.
 
              BILL turns over the engine.  It grinds away but does not catch.
 
              From an ANGLE behind the outside mirror, we hear the engine
              fail to catch.  We look in the mirror and see someone standing
              in the distance, watching.
 
              BILL gets out of the driver's side.  Slams the door.  The
              CAMERA TRUCKS with him as he opens the door to the engine.
              ALICE joins him as he shines his light on the engine.
 
                                  ALICE
                      What's the matter with it?

                      Wet.  I don't know.
 
              He tries a few more times.

                      It's over twenty miles to the
                      crossroads.  Steve'll be back in an
                      hour.  Things will straighten out then.
                      We'll take his Jeep and get help.
 
              He goes to her and cradles her face in his hands.

                            (continuing)
                      Don't worry.  There is probably some
                      really stupid explanation for all this.
                      When the sun comes up tomorrow, you'll
                      smile.

              The figure reaches our vantage point and is revealed as STEVE
              CHRISTY.  Just as he's about to make the turn into the

              BILL sits on the chair, a rifle across his lap.  In the BG,
              ALICE sits on the couch, dozing.  On the coffee table in front
              of her is a large machete.

              BILL's eyes are closing.  He jerks himself awake, then starts
              to doze again.
 
              The bulb overhead grows yellow, orange, and then goes out.
 
              BILL snaps awake.  He grabs a flashlight by his feet and flicks
              it on.

              He goes to the ping-pong table where he has placed some

              table.
 
              BILL checks on ALICE, makes sure she's asleep, then exits,
              carrying his rifle and a battery-operated fluorescent lamp.

              It has been smashed by the blow of a hammer.
 
              BILL goes to the gas tank and unscrews the top.  He looks
              in--there is enough gas.  He puts the cap back on.
 
              Then his eye catches something.  He looks at the broken plug.
              He shakes his head and looks around for a wrench to fix it.  He
              puts the rifle down on the floor of the shed.

              cups.  She stirs the coffee.
 
              Unable to contain her impatience any longer, ALICE picks up her
              lantern, grabs a slicker, and heads out the door.

              The door to the shed is closed.  ALICE looks around and then

              doesn't budge.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE decides to pull harder.
 
              She puts down her lamp and uses both hands and tugs.  She pulls
              until she finally wrenches the door open.  The lamp casts long
              shadows upwards.
 
              The generator sits silent.
 
              ALICE leans into the shed to look.
 
              The CAMERA TRACKS very slowly around behind her so that we can
              see behind the right-hand corner of the building.  As we clear
              the edge, we see something hanging from a rope which runs down
              from a branch above.
 
              The something turns slowly in the wind.  It is BILL--dead--in
              a travesty of the martyrdom of St. Sebastian, shot with arrows.

              She closes the door, and turns in the direction of the body.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE.  She is riveted with horror, unable to
              move or turn or run.  The SOUNDTRACK screams with the THEME,
              the insistent STINGER, a shriek and a thunderclap.
 
              ALICE finally gives voice to her terror--again and again.  She
              turns, leaving the lantern, and runs back towards the main
              cabin.

                      Jack!  Marcie!  Help me!
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       122    INT. BIG MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
 
              ALICE races to the coffee table, looking for BILL's machete.
              It is not there.
 
                                  ALICE
                      The knife!
 
              She gets down on her hands and knees to look for it.
 
              LOW ANGLE:  as she scrabbles on all fours.  Nothing under the
              couch.
 
              ALICE gets back up and rushes to the ping-pong table to get the
              lamp.
 
              Just as she reaches the table--which is more or less against a
              window--a figure swings, pendulum-like, into the glass,
              shattering the pane in the window opposite ALICE.
 
              It is BRENDA, long-since dead, dripping wet, white-faced.
 
              ALICE sees her, turns and runs as fast as she can for the front
              door.
 
              ALICE flings open the wooden door and runs into a rain-suited
              figure.
 
              ALICE screams.  The figure holds ALICE in a strong grasp.
 
              When ALICE focuses, she sees a kindly woman in her early
              forties.  She is strong, fairly tall, and very nice-looking.
              This is MRS. VOORHEES.  She wants ALICE to stop shrieking long
              enough to tell her what the matter is.  ALICE sobs incoherently,
              pointing back to the rear window.

                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      There now, my dear.  Please.  I can't
                      help you if you can't talk to me.
                      There, there now...
 
              ALICE allows the woman to lead her back into the room.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES leads ALICE to the couch.  In the BG we can see
              the broken window, but BRENDA is not visible.
 
                                  ALICE
                      He's dead... She's dead... all dead...
                      Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh
                      my God, oh my God... oh God...
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      It will be all right.  I'll take care of
                      you.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Jack?  Marcie?  Ned?
 
              MRS. VOORHEES comforts her with a strong arm.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      It's just this place.  The storm.
                      That's why you're all upset.
 
                                  ALICE
                      No, no, they're all dead...
 
              ALICE points over her shoulder towards the ping-pong table
              without looking.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES looks, shrugs.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      I'll go look.
 
              ALICE's face registers the new terror.
 
                                  ALICE
                      They'll kill you!  Don't leave me!
 
              MRS. VOORHEES smiles warmly.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      I'm not afraid.
 
              ALICE waits by the couch as MRS. VOORHEES crosses the room to
              the back window.
 
                                  ALICE
                      All dead?  Neddy?  Oh, Marcie...

              ALICE stands close to the fireplace.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES reaches the window and looks out.  BRENDA's body
              sways just out of reach.  MRS. VOORHEES is shocked.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      Oh, my lord...
 
              MRS. VOORHEES turns back and, as she passes the ping-pong table,
              she picks up the lantern.
 
              ALICE waits at the fireplace.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      So young, so pretty.  What monster could
                      have done such a thing?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Bill--Bill--Bill is out there...
 
              She lets MRS. VOORHEES take her in her arms.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      We shall go straight to the police.
 
              ALICE backs up.
 
                                  ALICE
                      The killer is still out there.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      I will protect you.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES looks around the room.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      Oh, this place... It should never have
                      been a camp.  Not for children.  They
                      had so much trouble here.
 
              The fire glimmers slightly in the fireplace.  A log burns
              through and rolls off, throwing up a small shower of sparks.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      Camp Blood.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES has almost completely calmed the girl down.
              Strokes her soft hair.

                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      You know a boy drowned the year before
                      those two others were killed?  An
                      accident?  It was inadequate supervision.
                      The counsellors were not paying enough
                      attention... They were making love when
                      that boy drowned.
 
              ALICE looks up as the WOMAN strokes her hair.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MCU as the OLDER WOMAN's hand strokes the
              YOUNGER WOMAN's hair.  The hand is missing its little finger!
 
              The THEME enters upon the TRACK in a lyrical, child-like
              version, echoing back to another era, pretty and light.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      We should go now.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES shakes her head gently.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      No.  That won't be necessary.
 
              As she speaks, MRS. VOORHEES reaches into her slicker in a
              surreptitious manner and very slowly slips out a long hunting
              knife.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I don't understand.
 
              MIXED on the TRACK, filtered, echoed and distant, is the SOUND
              of a ten year old boy, JASON, crying for help in a fantasy
              version of what might have happened when he drowned in 1957.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                            (filtered)
                      Help me, mommy... save me... please,
                      mommy... please, mommy... help me, mommy...
                      save me....
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (cocking her hand to listen)
                      I am, Jason.  I am.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (a little confused)
                      Why shouldn't we wait for Mr. Christy?

              MRS. VOORHEES has gone through some subtle changes.  While her
              voice remains warm and comforting, her face has started to slip
              into her other manifestation.  All of this is in concert with
              the visibility of her weapon.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      It was my son they killed.  They said he
                      drowned, but I know it was inadequate
                      supervision...
 
              ALICE starts to become increasingly anxious.  She can't see the
              knife rise behind her.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Mr. Christy will be back soon.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES shakes her head from side to side.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      No, he won't.  I killed him as well....
 
              The shock of recognition hits ALICE.  In CU her eyes look up
              and see the knife which MRS. VOORHEES now has poised and ready
              to strike.
 
              ALICE bolts off the couch and stumbles backwards into the
              fireplace, scattering ashes and sparks.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES stands and steps forward.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      I couldn't let them start this camp
                      again, could I?
 
              ALICE, in panic, looks for an escape.  She grabs the fireplace
              poker.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I won't let you!
 
              ALICE swings the poker back and forth.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (continuing)
                      No!  No!  No!
 
              MRS. VOORHEES raises her arm to slash downward with the knife.
              ALICE swings the poker hard to MRS. VOORHEES' other arm and rib
              cage.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES is in pain, her face a mask of rage.
 
              ALICE drops the poker to run for the door.

              MRS. VOORHEES hesitates for a moment, then follows ALICE
              deliberately.
 
              Lightning goes off followed quickly by thunder.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       123    EXT. MAIN CABIN/TREE - NIGHT
 
              ALICE gets to the door and stops.  She fiddles with the side of
              the screen... somebody has latched it.
 
              CLOSER on ALICE, taking one look over her shoulder, kicks at
              the door, snapping the latch.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  as ALICE runs out into the rain, the mud, the
              thunder and the lightning.  The THEME is going full-tilt as
              ALICE makes a quick turn to run towards the road.
 
              TWO-SHOT:  as ALICE bumps into an object which swings from
              above.  A slice of lightning reveals it to be the dead body of
              STEVE CHRISTY hanging from the tree.  A rope is looped under
              his arms, his head is down on his chest, and a long blade
              protrudes from his heart.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE in terror.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  ALICE runs and suddenly bumps into another pair
              of legs which swing from the same big tree.
 
              STROBE SHOT:  of JACK, dead.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  ALICE runs for the Arts & Crafts.  In the BG we
              see can the yellow-slickered MRS. VOORHEES closing the distance
              between herself and ALICE.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       124    EXT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - NIGHT
 
              ALICE runs for the door, slams through it.
 
              The CAMERA waits for MRS. VOORHEES, but she does not appear.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       125    EXT. GENERATOR SHACK - NIGHT
 
              MRS. VOORHEES runs to the door and opens it quickly.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

       126    INT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - NIGHT
 
              ALICE is hiding in the shadows behind a table.  We hear the
              SOUNDS of the generator starting outside and suddenly three
              bright overhead lights come on.
 
              ALICE looks across the room to the light switch, afraid to
              reveal her hiding place.
 
              She looks for an escape.  There's a window.  She starts for it,
              then stops and turns and dives under an arts & crafts table.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES opens the door and walks in a few
              feet.
 
              She carries a machete in her hand.  We see this instrument in
              CU as we hear OVER the sound of her son, JASON, calling to her.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                      Help, mommy, I'm drowning!  Oh, mommy,
                      please....
 
              The CAMERA PANS UP to her face and we see that the voice of
              JASON is coming from within her in LIP SYNC.  She is both
              characters--though the child's voice is authentically dubbed.
 
              ALICE can just make out what is happening and can hear the
              VOICE OF JASON.
 
              ALICE is very still.  Her eyes widen as she listens to MRS.
              VOORHEES rave.
 
                                  JASON (Lipsync)
                      Don't let me die, mommy... I can't
                      breathe... Help me, breathe...
 
              MRS. VOORHEES is having trouble catching her own breath.  She
              strokes her throat with her free hand and the voice of the
              child stops.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (in her own voice)
                      I can't let them kill any more children.
                      Come out now.
 
              She wades through table after table, pushing them out of her
              way with the strength she has demonstrated throughout as the
              PROWLER.
 
              When MRS. VOORHEES is too quick for her, shoving a table across
              her path like a barred door.  Before ALICE can think twice,
              MRS. VOORHEES has shoved a second table in behind her so that
              now ALICE is sandwiched between them.

              She can duck down or climb over or come out the only open end--
              the end where MRS. VOORHEES is standing.
 
              ALICE looks behind her and sees a shelf.  On the shelf is a box.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES is coming down the aisle between the two tables.
              Her machete is coming up in an attack.
 
              ALICE reaches into the box in CU and pulls out a handful of
              leather-working tools.  She hurls them at MRS. VOORHEES as hard
              as she can.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES has to put her arms up to ward off the spinning
              knives.  One cuts her under the eye and she lets out a low
              animal bellow.
 
              ALICE leaps up, climbs over the table and runs for the door.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES shoves the tables over and hurries after her.
 
              ALICE gets to the door, shuts off the light switch and runs out.
 
              We can hear JASON'S VOICE.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                      Kill her, mommy!  Kill her!

       127    EXT. CAMP GROUNDS/EQUIP. SHED - NIGHT
 
              The central area is bathed in light.  The rain has stopped.
              MRS. VOORHEES has turned on all the flood-lights.
 
              ALICE runs to the corner of one of the cabins.  She stops to
              look back.  MRS. VOORHEES is gaining on her.
 
              ALICE runs to the equipment shed.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  The door is thrown back.  ALICE goes in.  Looks
              for a weapon.  Nothing is available.  ALICE sobs with fear.
              She runs.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES passes the equipment shed.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

       128    EXT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT
 
              A single bulb outside the building shows ALICE as she bursts
              through the door.

       129    INT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT
 
              It is a small cabin.  On the walls are five .22 calibre rifles.
 
              ALICE runs into the dimly lit cabin and takes one of the rifles
              from the wall.
 
              She rummages in a drawer.  It's empty.  She tries another.
              Empty.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Where are the goddamned bullets?
 
              The next drawer has a lock and hasp on it.
 
              ALICE looks around.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       130    EXT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT
 
              MRS. VOORHEES is on her way, charging through the night.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       131    INT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT
 
              ANGLE ON ALICE:  She whacks the hasp with the butt of the
              rifle.  The hasp doesn't give.  She gives it another butt
              stroke.  It won't give.  A shadow covers ALICE's back.  She
              turns.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES is standing in the doorway,
              blocking the light.  Still carrying the machete, MRS. VOORHEES
              steps slowly toward ALICE.
 
              ALICE, with an almost useless .22 in her hands, does the only
              thing she can.  She takes the weapon by the barrel and,
              swinging it like a baseball bat, whacks MRS. VOORHEES on the
              arm/shoulder, knocking the killer off balance and into the wall.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES slams through a flimsy table, crushing it, and
              drops to the floor.

              ALICE runs out the door.

       132    EXT. MAIN CABIN FRONT - NIGHT
 
              ALICE huffs past the dead camper van, through the mud to the
              front door of the main cabin.  She runs in quickly.  There is
              no sign of MRS. VOORHEES.  She turns off the lights and runs
              into the kitchen.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       133    INT. KITCHEN AREA - NIGHT
 
              ALICE looks from side to side, hoping to find a place to hide.
              She spots the half-open door to the larder, looks inside and
              then hides there, closing the door behind her.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       134    INT. LARDER - NIGHT
 
              There is some light that comes through the cracks and crevices.
              ALICE's hands fasten onto the inside lock--the dead bolt type
              which requires a key to unlock it from the other side.
 
              ALICE relaxes a little bit now that she is locked inside.
 
              As soon as she relaxes, we hear the front screen door slam.
              Then we hear some shuffling around outside.  The lights are
              turned on.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                      Please kill her, mommy... Help me,
                      please.  Kill her, mommy.
 
              There is the sound of pots being rustled through.  Then the
              sound of another door being slammed.
 
              ALICE relaxes again.
 
              Then there is a silence.  ALICE thinks about unlocking the door
              now.  She reaches out for the lock.  Then thinks better of the
              idea.
 
              She cases down the door frame to the floor.  On all sides are
              the cans of food and cooking implements.  There is a large
              skillet, some bags of flour, etc.
 
              ALICE covers her head with her arms.

              The doorknob above her head (a few inches away) turns very
              slowly.  We see it, but she does not.  MRS. VOORHEES' hand
              finishes turning and now starts to push gently.  There is
              almost no give, but we see that the door is being tested.
 
              The voice on the other side is very young, very sing-song.
 
                                  JASON (O.S.)
                      Come out, come out, wherever you are...
 
              ALICE jerks back and stands up on the far side of the small
              room.
 
              Fists bang in a rage on the floor.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Please...
 
              ALICE folds her hands at the side of her face.
 
              The fist-banging gives way to a short silence.
 
              The silence is interrupted by a new sound:  MRS. VOORHEES has
              begun to use her machete to chop away at the outside of the
              door to the larder.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE... oh, my God...
 
              At first we see nothing on our side.  Then, gradually, we see
              little slivers of lights admitted by the blade's chops.  ALICE's
              eyes race around the larder to try to find a weapon, a defense,
              anything...
 
              Larger holes are now made.  MRS. VOORHEES stops just long enough
              to take a peck inside.  We can see her eye at the largest hole.
              She goes back to whacking away at the door.  The hole is near
              the lock.  It is soon big enough for MRS. VOORHEES to reach
              inside with her hand and turn the rachet.
 
              ALICE realizes she must defend herself.  She reaches down and
              picks up a heavy skillet and, as the door opens, ALICE raises
              her weapon and, screaming, charges the woman who is trying to
              come through the entrance.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES chops down with the machete.  ALICE fends off the
              blow with the skillet that she holds with both hands above her
              head.  As the machete blade bounces off the skillet, ALICE is
              able to swing the skillet downward and hit MRS. VOORHEES with
              a solid blow on top of her head.  MRS. VOORHEES sprawls
              sideways across the table and then collapses in a heap on the
              floor.

              ALICE raises the skillet again to strike.  She crosses
              carefully to MRS. VOORHEES and pushes her gently with her foot,
              the way she might poke a dead animal in the roadway.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES lies totally inert.  There is a
              small puddle of blood under her head.
 
              ANGLE ON ALICE:  She relaxes, puts down her weapon and crosses
              slowly out of the room.

              The moon comes out from behind a cloud.  ALICE pushes a canoe
              into the water and paddles, as rapidly as her tired body will
              permit, out in the lake to safety.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

              Exhausted, ALICE puts her paddle across her lap and falls
              forward, slumped across a thwart.

              The first rays of sunlight streak the sky from beyond the
              horizon, promising a hot and sunny summer's day.  The birds are
              up, foraging for food.
 
              As the CAMERA scans the peaceful scene, we see the sky
              reflected in the calm waters of Crystal Lake.  The canoe
              holding ALICE is drifting in big slow circles across the
              surface of the lake.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       138    EXT. LAKE - DAWN
 
              ALICE lies, in MCU, in the canoe, sleeping.  She has not
              changed her position since collapsing a few hours before.  The
              water laps gently against the side of the canoe.  Very slowly,
              she wakes.  She opens her eyes.
 
              The canoe has drifted into the shade of some enormous tree
              boughs that overhang the edge of the lake.

              They shade ALICE from the bright rays of the sun.  The canoe
              rocks gently.  ALICE is still, listening to the sound of the
              lapping water.
 
              Suddenly there is a blood-curdling scream, a MUSICAL STINGER,
              and the screen is filled with the flying, whirling form of MRS.
              VOORHEES, who leaps from the overhanging boughs into the canoe,
              barely missing ALICE's slumped form!
 
              The canoe immediately overturns and both MRS. VOORHEES and ALICE
              try to find their footing in the shallow water.  MRS. VOORHEES
              is covered in mud and blood.  She sees ALICE struggling to get
              up and move toward her, brandishing her blood-spattered machete.
              ALICE turns, sees MRS. VOORHEES coming.  ALICE grabs a paddle
              floating near her.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES pushes the canoe to one side, wading through the
              waist-high water as fast as she can.  She screams with rage.
              Her face goes through a horrifying transformation.  From her
              mouth comes the VOICE OF JASON.
 
                                  JASON (Lipsync)
                      Mommy!  Mommy!  Mommy!
 
              ALICE can't move fast enough to get away from MRS. VOORHEES,
              who is slashing the air with her big knife trying to hit ALICE.
              ALICE slips, falls in the water, gets her footing back and has
              to turn and block the blow of the machete with the paddle,
              using it like a staff to ward off the blow.  The machete cuts
              the paddle nearly in half.  MRS. VOORHEES raises the knife for
              another blow and ALICE lunges for her knees and succeeds in
              throwing MRS. VOORHEES into the water.  The machete flies out
              of her hand and lands in the water.  The two women roll in the
              water.  MRS. VOORHEES is trying to strangle ALICE, her hands
              stretching to reach around her throat.  They roll over and
              under the water.  We cannot see who is winning.
 
              Suddenly MRS. VOORHEES finds her footing and stands up, looking
              for ALICE.  She is screeching madly.
 
                                  JASON (Lipsync)
                            (continuing)
                      Kill her, mommy!  Kill her, mommy!
 
              ALICE shoots up out of the water holding the machete, and in
              one, wild swing, decapitates MRS. VOORHEES, whose head flies
              off into the water.
 
              The body stands for a minute, then falls heavily into the lake.
 
              ALICE drops the machete into the water and starts to wade to
              shore.

       139    EXT. CAMP ROAD/SIGN - MORNING
 
              ALICE walks slowly down the road away from the camp.  We hear
              the sound of a car approaching.  Now it comes into view.  It is
              a state vehicle, black and white, with an emblem on the door
              that says "State Department of Health and Safety".  There are
              two middle-aged bureaucrats inside.
 
              ALICE waves down the car, which pulls up beside her.

                                  ALICE
                      Help me.
 
              The CAMERA PANS BACK while the two men get out of their vehicle
              and come around to help ALICE.

              LONG SHOT of the camp with the sun sparkling on the waters of

              Langley, Illinois.  A quiet suburb located fifty miles
              outside of Chicago.
 
              SUPER the legend:  "Langley, Illinois.  October 28th 1998"
 
              A HOUSE
 
              nestled in the middle of a tree-lined street.  A Honda Civic
              pulls into a darkened driveway, the headlights are
              extinguished...
 
              PAMELA WHITTINGTON, a middle-aged woman in full registered
              nurse attire, emerges from the parked car.
 
              An unlit cigarette dangles loosely from her lips.  She heads
              to the porch, digging through her purse in search of a
              light...
 
              CRUNCH!
 
              Pamela stops in her tracks, looks down at her feet to discover
 
              GLASS
 
              scattered across the porch.  She looks at the porch light
              hanging above her head.
 
              A SHATTERED LIGHT BULB occupies the socket.
 
              Pamela turns her attention to the front door... it's slightly
              ajar.  She pushes on it gently.... the door swings open
              freely, revealing the darkened interior.

              Pamela drops her purse... darts across some hedges into the
              neighbor's yard...
 
              EXT. THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR
 
              Pamela runs up to the porch, decorated with carved
              pumpkins... POUNDS furiously on the front door, decorated
              with a CARDBOARD SKELETON.
 
              NO ANSWER.
 
              She POUNDS again... HARDER.  Suddenly, the door SWINGS open
              to reveal
 
              AN OMINOUS FIGURE
 
              looming in the doorway.  A HOCKEY MASK cloaks his face.

              A PAIR OF EYES
 
              glare at Pamela from behind the cut-outs in the plastic
              vizard.
 
              PAMELA
 
              gasps, stumbles backward.

              flips up his mask to reveal
 
              JIMMY HOWELL
 
              a gangly teen, wearing a hockey jersey... skates slung over
              his shoulder.

                        I think someone broke into my
                        house.
 
                                  JIMMY
                        No shit?!
 
                                  PAMELA
                        No shit.

              INT. LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER
 
              Pamela sits on the couch taking hits off a lit cigarette.
              Jimmy paces the room, portable phone pressed against his ear.
 
                                  JIMMY
                            (into phone)
                        3037 Keystone.. yeah... gotcha.
 
              Jimmy hangs up the portable...

                                  JIMMY
                            (continuing)
                        Said to give 'em fifteen minutes.
                        They'll send someone by.
 
              Jimmy grabs his hockey stick, heads for the door.
 
                                  PAMELA
                        Jimmy, what are you doing?
 
                                  JIMMY
                        Checking out your place.
 
                                  PAMELA
                        No.  Wait for the police.
 
                                  JIMMY
                        And miss the big game?  No way.

              EXT. HOUSE - MINUTES LATER
 
              Pamela stands at the foot of her driveway... watches as Jimmy
              climbs the steps to her porch, hockey stick perched high on
              his shoulder.
 
              JIMMY
 
              moves toward the front door, stepping on pieces of shattered
              light bulb beneath him.
 
              He swings open the front door with the tip of his stick...
              looks inside the darkened house.
 
              He enters cautiously, stick at the ready.
 
              PAMELA
 
              lights up another cigarette, watches nervously as Jimmy
              disappears from view...
 
              INT. HOUSE
 
              Jimmy enters the dimmed foyer.
 
                                  JIMMY
                            (calling off)
                        Hey, man, don't mess with me!
                        I'll knock your head clean off
                        your body!
 
              He moves stealthily through the house, hockey stick poised
              high in the air... room-by-room he checks for intruders...

              Jimmy finds his way to the rear of the home, crosses to a
              back bedroom, stands in the doorway...
 
                                  JIMMY
                            (continuing)
                        Oh, shit...
 
              ON THE BEDROOM
 
              Converted to a home office... ransacked... file cabinets
              overturned, pictures hang crooked on the walls, papers carpet
              the floor...
 
              JIMMY
 
              drops the stick to his side, convinced he is now alone in the
              house.
 
              He crosses back into the kitchen... steals a cookie from a
              cookie jar... opens the fridge... takes a swig from an open
              milk carton... completely unaware that --
 
              THE BEDROOM CLOSET DOOR
 
              is opening slowly behind him, then suddenly --
 
              CRASH!
 
              An IRONING BOARD topples out from inside, slams against his
              back, hard.
 
              JIMMY
 
              snaps the hockey stick into position... spins around...
              swings wildly with the wooden baton.  He makes contact with...
 
              A POT RACK
 
              suspended above the island... pots dangling from their hooks
              come clanging down on top of him...
 
              The dust settles... Jimmy realizes he's been beating the
              stuffing out of an ironing board.  He sheepishly exits the
              kitchen...
 
              EXT. HOUSE - MINUTES LATER
 
              Pamela stands at the foot of the driveway, trying to see in
              to the darkened house...
 
                                  PAMELA
                        Come on, damn it...

              Jimmy emerges from the house... looks like Wayne Gretsky
              after slamming in his record goal.  He smiles at Pamela
              smugly...
 
                                  JIMMY
                        Nothing to fear.  The coast is
                        clear.
 
                                  PAMELA
                        You sure?
 
                                  JIMMY
                        Totally.  I checked all the rooms
                        and closets...
 
                                  PAMELA
                        Nothing's missing?
 
                                  JIMMY
                        Don't think so.  But they sure did
                        a real number on your office.
                        Crap everywhere.
 
                                  PAMELA
                        My office?
 
                                  JIMMY
                        Yeah.  Oh, and they messed up your
                        kitchen pretty good, too...
                        Goodnight.
 
              Jimmy scurries off, avoiding any more questions.
 
              Pamela heads back to the house.
 
              INT. HOUSE
 
              Pamela enters the house, LOCKS AND BOLTS the front door
              behind her.  She breathes a heavy sigh of relief, back
              against the door... she flicks on a light switch... NOTHING.
 
                                  PAMELA
                        Christ, Jimmy... didn't you try
                        the goddamn lights?!
 
              Pamela moves down the hallway to the laundry room... she
              opens the door to the FUSE BOX... toggles some fuses on and
              off... tries the laundry room light... still NOTHING,
              darkness.
 
                                  PAMELA
                            (continuing)
                        Shit.

              She grabs a flashlight out of the nearby cupboard, and
              proceeds down the hall to --
 
              INT. OFFICE
 
              The converted bedroom in complete disarray... Pamela
              navigates through the wreckage, carving a path with the beam
              of her flashlight.  She approaches --
 
              A DESK
 
              completely bare except for a single FILE FOLDER resting on
              its top.
 
              PAMELA
 
              shines the beam on the lone file folder.
 
              ON the folder... the index tab reads "KERI TATE."  Pamela
              opens the folder, it's EMPTY.
 
              PAMELA
 
              gasps, the blood rushes from her face.  She immediately
              rushes for the phone.
 
              CLANK!
 
              A noise is heard.  She's not alone in this house.  She moves
              through the hallway to discover the front door wide open.
              Shit.  She bolts.
 
              EXT. HOUSE
 
              Pamela runs out the door and back to Jimmy's house.  She
              opens the front door, disappears inside.
 
              INT. HOUSE
 
              Pamela shuts the door behind her... cranes her neck,
              searching for any signs of Jimmy --
 
              She HEARS the sounds of a television emanating from deep
              within the house.
 
                                  PAMELA
                            (calling off)
                        Jimmy!  You still there?!
 
              CAMERA FOLLOWS Pamela as she makes her way from one darkened
              room to the next... she crosses into the den to discover

              JIMMY
 
              seated in an easy-chair, watching an episode of "SEINFELD."
              his back to Pamela... only his legs are visible from her
              point-of-view.
 
              Pamela approaches him --
 
                                  PAMELA
                        Goddamnit, Jimmy!  Someone's still
                        in my house!
 
              Pamela spins the easy-chair around to reveal --
 
              A HOCKEY SKATE
 
              embedded deep into Jimmy's face... the blade slicing through
              flesh, from forehead to chin... eyes wide open in terror...
              blood cascades down his jersey...
 
              PAMELA
 
              screams... bolts through the house, reaches the front door to
              find --
 
              A CHINA CABINET
 
              pushed in front of it, blocks her way!  She tries fiercely to
              move the wooden hutch, but can't...
 
              Pamela runs back through the house, frantic... in desperate
              search of an exit.
 
              She crosses into the kitchen, spots her escape... moves to
              the rear door, opens it to reveal...
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              standing, poised, evil eyes burning through slits in his
              trademark mask.
 
              PAMELA
 
              shrieks... grabs a knife out of a nearby butcher block...
              heads back to the living room.
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              moves after her, the hunt is on...
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM
 
              FLASHING RED AND BLUE LIGHTS

              illuminate the room...
 
              PAMELA
 
              runs to a window...
 
              ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW
 
              A squad car arrives in front of Pamela's house.  Two
              UNIFORMED COPS emerge from the vehicle, head up her driveway.
 
              PAMELA
 
              Struggles to open the window... she can't manage to disengage
              the lock... she pounds feverishly on the glass --
 
                                  PAMELA
                            (yelling)
                        HELP!  GODDAMNIT IT!  OVER HERE!
                        GOD PLEASE!
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              appears behind her... grabs an IRON POKER from a group of
              fireplace utensils.
 
              PAMELA
 
              spins around, swings at the Shape with the knife...
 
                                  PAMELA
                        Stay the fuck away from me!
 
              The Shape swings the iron poker... delivers a severe blow to
              Pamela's arm... breaks it... the knife falls to the floor
              below.
 
              Pamela howls in pain... drops to her knees, nurses her arm...
 
              The Shape raises the poker high into the air, comes down
              hard... drives the tip of the poker through her skull...
              CRACK!
 
              EXT. PAMELA'S FRONT PORCH - SAME TIME
 
              In the f.g. two cops climb the porch steps and move into the
              house.
 
              In the b.g. we can see the Shape through the neighboring
              window as he repeatedly stabs Pamela with the poker.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

              CLOSE ON A PLAQUE
 
              "HILLCREST ACADEMY.  ESTABLISHED 1874"
 
              THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a co-ed boarding school...
              set behind massive wrought-iron gates on acreage in a
              secluded region of Wisconsin.
 
              SUPER the legend:  "Ferndale, Wisconsin.  October 29th 1998."
 
              The academy's gothic architecture and rich history can be
              seen throughout the entire campus, consisting of a cluster of
              buildings:  the school, the dorms, a gymnasium with indoor
              swimming pool, a bell tower, a guard house and --
 
              A GROUP OF FACULTY HOUSES
 
              litters the far end of the campus.
 
              CLOSE ON a kitchen window.  Inside KERI TATE, mid-thirties,
              stands behind a sink washing dishes.
 
              On closer inspection, we see that this face is none other
              that LAURIE STRODE.
 
              INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
 
              Keri stands with her back to JOHN, 16, chiseled good looks.
              He stands behind her in the doorway... They are in mid-
              conversation --
 
                                  KERI
                        Nothing's changed since yesterday,
                        or last week, or last month... the
                        answer's still "no."
 
                                  JOHN
                        You're so predictable.
 
              Keri grabs the sprayer, squirts John from across the room.
 
                                  JOHN
                            (continuing)
                        What the --

                        Betcha' didn't predict that.
 
              Keri throws John a dishtowel... he dabs at his shirt.

                                  JOHN
                        I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be
                        able to live wherever I want.
 
                                  KERI
                        And I should have a son who calls
                        me "Mom".  Looks like we're both
                        shit out of luck.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom.
                        Now can I move into the dorms?
 
                                  KERI
                        No.
 
              Keri hands John a stack of clean dishes.  John doesn't
              budge...
 
                                  JOHN
                        Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
 
                                  KERI
                        You're father thinks it's okay to
                        run off to Cancun with a blonde
                        bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow
                        his opinion doesn't count.
 
                                  JOHN
                        I promise not to run off to Cancun.
 
                                  KERI
                        Forget it.
 
                                  JOHN
                            (pointing out the
                             kitchen window)
                        The dorms are only fifty feet
                        away.  You could practically see
                        into my window.  So, what
                        difference does it make?
 
                                  KERI
                        My point exactly.  See, we both
                        agree.
 
              Keri takes the dishes back from John, puts them away in an
              overhead cupboard.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Alright, I was wrong.  There is a
                        big difference between rooming
                        with your buddies and living with
                        your mother and school headmaster.

                                  KERI
                        I took the padlock off your door.
                        What more do you want?
 
                                  JOHN
                        My life is a living hell.
 
              Keri raises an eyebrow...
 
                                  KERI
                        It's not, trust me.
 
              John gives up, heads out of the room...
 
                                  KERI
                            (continuing)
                        Where are you going?
 
                                  JOHN
                        To the bathroom.  Can I do that
                        alone or do you want to watch?
 
                                  KERI
                        I thought you'd never ask.
 
              Keri puts her arms around John, escorts him out of the
              kitchen...
 
                                  JOHN
                        You're twisted.
 
                                  KERI
                        I know.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. HILLCREST ACADEMY - DAY
 
              Keri moves across campus toward the school, a leather
              briefcase slung over one shoulder.
 
              Passing STUDENTS ad-lib "Hellos," their admiration for Keri
              made evident by their favorable rapport with her.
 
              Keri passes in front of --
 
              A ROW OF SCHOOL BUSES
 
              parked alongside the school.  An older bus on the far end
              sits empty, hood up.
 
              WALLY BECKETTE, a rather portly man in his early sixties, and
              the school custodian, fiddles with the exposed engine.

                                  KERI
                        Wally, you've been under that hood
                        for months.  Why don't we just
                        call a mechanic?
 
              Wally stops what he is doing... comes out from beneath the
              hood... wipes his hands on his pants.
 
                                  WALLY
                        Miss Tate, I serviced B-1 Bombers
                        in W-W-2.  This here is child's
                        play.
 
                                  KERI
                        So you're saying I should call a
                        child to come give you a hand?
 
              Wally chuckles softly, charmed by Keri like the rest of the
              staff.
 
                                  WALLY
                        I'm saying she'll be purring like
                        a kitten before you know it.
 
                                  KERI
                        There's your problem, Walter.  You
                        don't want it to purr, you want it
                        to start.
 
                                  WALLY
                        And she will, Miss Tate.  She will.
 
              Keri continues toward the school.  Wally watches with
              admiration as she heads into the building...
 
                                  WALLY
                            (continuing)
                        Mmmm-mmm.  If they had teachers
                        like you when I was a boy, I'd be
                        a rocket scientist.
 
              Wally goes back to tinkering with the engine...
 
              ON HATTIE SMITH, mid-sixties, dressed in a guard uniform...
              approaches Keri, looking very official... holds a key in her
              hand.
 
                                  KERI
                        Good morning, Hattie.
 
                                  HATTIE
                        Went into town.  Had that
                        duplicate key made.

              Hattie hands Keri the key.
 
                                  KERI
                        Thank you.
 
              Hattie extends an open hand.
 
                                  HATTIE
                        Thank me with two bucks.
 
                                  KERI
                        Oh... right.
 
              Keri digs through her pocket, produces a handful of change...
              gives it to Hattie.
 
                                  HATTIE
                            (dripping sarcasm)
                        Just what I wanted... more change.
 
              Hattie heads back toward the guard house, turns back to
              Keri --
 
                                  HATTIE
                            (continuing)
                        And next time you lose a gate key,
                        young lady, you'll be climbing
                        your way out of here.
 
              Keri holds the key to her chest.
 
                                  KERI
                        I'll be more careful next time.
 
              Hattie dismisses Keri with a wave of her hand, continues
              across campus to the guard house.
 
              Keri smiles, places the key in her pocket and disappears
              inside the school...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
 
              Pouring rain.  In stark contrast to the sunny campus of
              Hillcrest...
 
              EMERGENCY VEHICLES litter the landscape, lights FLASHING.
 
              OFFICERS wrap yellow crime scene tape around the perimeter,
              keeping curious NEIGHBORS at bay...

              RICHARD CARTER
 
              a middle-aged police detective, eyes bloodshot from too
              little sleep and one too many hours in front of a computer
              screen, emerges from a dark Sedan... a lit cigarette dangles
              loosely from his lips.
 
              Carter approaches a young OFFICER standing outside the front
              door --
 
                                  CARTER
                            (flashes his badge)
                        Detective Richard Carter,
                        Haddonfield P.D.  Detective Blake
                        called my office...
 
              The Officer motions to the door --
 
                                  OFFICER
                        Go on in.  She's been waiting for
                        you.
 
              Carter heads towards the door, the Officer grabs his arm...
 
                                  OFFICER
                            (continuing)
                        You might need this...
 
              The Officer offers him a small jar of petroleum jelly.
              Carter waves it away.
 
                                  OFFICER
                            (continuing)
                        Some serious shit in there,
                        Detective.
 
              Carter reconsiders, smears the Vaseline under each nostril...
              heads for the house.
 
              INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE
 
              Carter crosses through the front door, watches as
 
              A TEAM of latex-gloved FORENSIC SPECIALISTS
 
              dust door and windows for fingerprints, swab at blood drops,
              and collect carpet fibers for later analysis...
 
              Carter crosses into the living room, winces at

              PAMELA WHITTINGTON
 
              sprawled across the floor in front of blood-soaked
              curtains... the wrought-iron poker jammed up her nose, exits
              through the top of her skull... a kitchen knife lies beside
              her...
 
              Carter takes another hit off the cigarette, blows smoke into
              the room...
 
                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                        Double homicide.
 
              Carter turns to see
 
              TONI BLAKE
 
              standing behind him... mid-twenties, attractive yet
              approachable...
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Her name's Pamela Whittington,
                        next door neighbor to victim
                        number two... James Howell.
 
              Carter motions in the direction of the den where
 
              A CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHER
 
              takes snapshots of the teenage corpse.
 
                                  CARTER
                        Let me guess... he's the guy with
                        the hockey skate for a nose ring.
 
              BLAKE
 
              crosses to Carter, extends a dixie cup in his direction --
 
                                  CARTER
                        No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
 
                                  BLAKE
                        It's for your cigarette.  I prefer
                        not to contaminate my crime scene
                        with micropollutants.
 
              Carter takes a final puff off the cigarette, drops it into
              the cup...
 
                                  CARTER
                        Why am I here?

                                  BLAKE
                        They said on the phone you were
                        assigned to the Meyers case.
 
                                  CARTER
                        With all due respect, detective,
                        you can't go blaming every brutal
                        murder in Illinois on Michael
                        Meyers.
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Pamela Whittington was a long time
                        associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home
                        office was ransacked.  It was
                        chock full of Loomis' files on
                        Meyers.  It'd say that makes
                        Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
 
                                  CARTER
                        Well, when you put it that way.
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Right.  So why don't we get on
                        with this investigation?
 
                                  CARTER
                        I like a woman who takes control.
 
              Blake ignores the comment, crosses to the front door...
              Carter follows.
 
              During the following dialogue, Blake walks Carter through the
              crime scene reenacting the prior evening's brutal events...
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Pamela entered the house and
                        walked into the den where she
                        discovers James Howell's body...
 
              Carter and Blake stand in front of the mutilated face of the
              teenage boy...
 
                                  BLAKE
                            (continuing)
                        Shaken, she returns to the front
                        door to find the hutch blocking
                        her exit...
 
              ON gouges across the wood planks, forming tracks from the
              dining room to the front door...

                                  BLAKE
                            (continuing)
                        She runs to the kitchen, where she
                        is ambushed at the back door by
                        the killer.
 
              Carter and Blake stand in front of the door, which is still
              open.  Carter kneels down, looks at the kitchen floor...
 
                                  CARTER
                        One set of muddy shoe prints.
 
                                  BLAKE
                        That don't match either of the
                        victim's.
 
              Carter stands up, moves to a butcher block on the counter...
              he's starting to enjoy this dance --
 
                                  CARTER
                        She grabs a knife from the butcher
                        block.
 
              ON the butcher block, an empty slot where the knife once
              resided...
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Heads to the living room...
 
              They cross back into the living room...
 
              Carter moves to the
 
              WINDOW
 
              covered in fingerprint powder, exposing a plethora of prints.
 
                                  CARTER
                        Where, judging by the looks of the
                        finger and palm prints, she
                        struggles to open the window
                        before banging on it like hell.
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Unable to escape, she turns and
                        attacks the killer, but doesn't
                        connect.
 
                                  CARTER
                        No blood on the knife.
 
              ON the knife, clean as a whistle...

                                  CARTER
                            (continuing)
                        The killer knocks the knife out of
                        her hand with the wrought-iron
                        poker.
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Broken blood vessels on her right
                        forearm.
 
              ON Pamela's arm, a bruise forming under the skin...
 
                                  CARTER
                        As which point she drops to her
                        knees in pain...
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Explaining the low height of the
                        blood splatter on the curtains...
 
              ON the curtains, blood stained four feet and below...
 
                                  CARTER
                        Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you
                        learn how to do that?
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Girl scouts.
 
              Carter chuckles... she has a sense of humor, too...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON
 
              A BELL RINGS.
 
              The hallway is flooded with STUDENTS, books in tow...
 
              ON MOLLY CARTWRIGHT
 
              a young seventeen, friendly eyes and a face to match.
 
              Walking beside her is...
 
              LINDA KANG, same age, unconcerned, full of spunk... multiple
              body piercings, doesn't quite fit in here or anywhere...
 
                                  LINDA
                        You aced it, didn't you?
 
                                  MOLLY
                        I did alright.

              Linda grabs Molly's test, peeking out from her biology book...
 
                                  LINDA
                        Fuckin' A.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.
 
              Linda punches Molly playfully in the arm.  They stop at
              neighboring lockers, retrieve books from inside...
 
              AMY KRAMER approaches, book pressed against an ample chest,
              smacking on a wad of gum...
 
              Eye-catching good looks, a real stunner... a bit short on the
              gray matter though --
 
                                  AMY
                        These lockers are totally girl
                        unfriendly.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Break another nail?
 
                                  AMY
                        Pointer finger.  And the dance is
                        in two days...
 
                                  LINDA
                        Life's a bitch.
 
              The girls head down the hall...
 
                                  AMY
                        Eddie's working late at Freeman's
                        tonight... all alone.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        I thought Eddie left for N.Y.U.?
 
                                  AMY
                        Guess he couldn't tear himself
                        away from me.
 
                                  LINDA
                        Guess he couldn't pass admissions.
 
                                  AMY
                        Shut up, pinhead.
 
              John approaches them from behind, drapes his arms around
              Molly...

                                  JOHN
                        There you are.
                            (to Amy)
                        You tell 'em about tonight?
 
                                  AMY
                        I just got here.
 
              John removes a key from his jacket pocket, drops it in
              Molly's hand...
 
                                  MOLLY
                        What's this?
 
                                  LINDA
                        You say, "The key to my heart,"
                        and I'm gonna hurl.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key
                        to the main gate.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Where'd you get it?
 
                                  JOHN
                        Swiped it from my mom's desk
                        yesterday.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        You stole it?
 
                                  JOHN
                        I borrowed it.
 
                                  AMY
                        Party at Freeman's tonight.
 
                                  LINDA
                        I am in need of some serious
                        partying.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Not me.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Why not?
 
                                  MOLLY
                        I can't afford to get caught.

                                  LINDA
                        Molly, you're the resident
                        assistant.  What are you gonna do,
                        narc on yourself?
 
              THE BELL RINGS.
 
              Students clear the hall, move inside their classrooms.
 
              John kisses Molly on the lips...
 
                                  JOHN
                        Just meet me in front of the gate
                        after lights out.
 
              He takes off down the hall --
 
                                  MOLLY
                            (calling after him)
                        Wait... John...
 
              He's gone.  A teacher guides the girls inside a classroom and
              shuts the door...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. GYMNASIUM - AFTERNOON
 
              A bevy of STUDENTS scurry about the gym making final
              preparations for the impending Halloween Festivals:  hanging
              decorations on walls, carving pumpkins, spinning cob webs
              along refreshment tables...
 
              ON WILL BRENNEN, a well-favored Chemistry teacher in his mid-
              forties, thinning hair, more salt than pepper... supervises
              the action... a coffee mug in hand... his attention focused
              on...
 
              KERI
 
              sitting atop the bleachers.  Will climbs the benches, sits
              beside her...
 
                                  WILL
                        What a sight for sore eyes...
 
              He kisses her softly on the lips.
 
                                  WILL
                            (continuing)
                        ... and ears...
 
              He kisses her again.

                                  WILL
                            (continuing)
                        ...and lips...
 
              He engages her in a lingering kiss.
 
              A GROUP OF STUDENTS
 
              point and giggle at the smooching faculty members.
 
              Keri notices, pulls away...
 
                                  KERI
                        Will...
 
              She motions toward the students below.
 
                                  WILL
                        What?  They've all taken sex ed.
 
              He leans in for another kiss, she playfully keeps him at arms
              length...
 
                                  KERI
                        And this isn't the place for a
                        live demonstration.
 
              Will relents, settles for holding Keri's hand...
 
                                  WILL
                        Aren't they doing a terrific job
                        this year?
 
                                  KERI
                            (distracted)
                        Looks great.  It does.
 
                                  WILL
                        You okay?  You seem a little off.
 
                                  KERI
                        Nothing a good stiff drink can't
                        fix.
 
              Will doesn't find the humor, eyes her uneasily.
 
                                  KERI
                            (continuing)
                        That one always goes over big at
                        the AA meetings.
 
              An awkward beat, then...

                                  WILL
                        It's John, isn't it?
 
                                  KERI
                        It's always John.
 
                                  WILL
                        Still wants to move out?
 
                                  KERI
                        He's been living out of moving
                        boxes for three months.
 
                                  WILL
                        This kid just wants his freedom.
 
                                  KERI
                        It's not going to happen.
 
                                  WILL
                        The tighter you squeeze, the
                        harder he'll try to break free.
 
                                  KERI
                        Oh, please... you get that out of
                        a fortune cookie?
 
                                  WILL
                        Doesn't make it bad advice.
 
              Keri manages a smile...
 
                                  WILL
                            (continuing)
                        God I love that smile.
 
              Keri stands.  Will follows suit.
 
                                  KERI
                        I'm going into town... run a few
                        errands before dark.  Need
                        anything?
 
                                  WILL
                        A box of fortune cookies... I'm
                        running out of advice.
 
                                  KERI
                        Bye Will.
 
              Keri heads down the bleachers.  Will watches her leave,
              completely enamored...
 
                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. NIELSEN'S MARKET - LATE AFTERNOON
 
              A family-owned grocery mart in the heart of Ferndale.  A half-
              dozen CUSTOMERS mingle through the aisles.
 
              ON Keri, standing in front of a CASHIER as he rings up a
              dozen items...
 
              Keri glances at the wall of tabloids in front of her, one of
              them catches her eye --
 
              CLOSE ON: THE GLOBE
 
              A headline reads: "SERIAL KILLER MICHAEL MEYERS REALLY ALIEN
              FROM OUTER SPACE."  Beneath the headline is a mock photo of
              the Shape, holding the infamous mask in his hand, revealing
              an alien head underneath....
 
              Keri can't help but smirk at the absurdity of it all.  The
              cashier hands Keri her change...
 
                                  CASHIER
                        Happy Halloween.
 
              Keri manages a polite smile, and exits...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. NIELSEN'S MARKET - MINUTES LATER
 
              Keri moves down the tree-lined street, groceries tucked
              securely under her arm.
 
              She pauses at a storefront window.  "KESSLER JEWELERS.  EST.
              1963" emblazoned across the glass.
 
              ANGLE ON WINDOW
 
              An assortment of wedding rings glimmer behind the glass.
 
              KERI
 
              holds her left hand up to the window, moving it slowly from
              ring to ring... then she sees --
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              in the reflection... standing across the street, staring
              right through her... taunting her.  This is no alien...
 
              KERI'S
 
              heart stops... she stands frozen, totally immobile.

              A TRUCK
 
              passes between them.
 
              KERI
 
              takes this opportunity to spin around.  The truck passes --
 
              THE SHAPE HAS VANISHED.
 
                                  KERI
                        I hate this fucking holiday...
 
              Keri climbs into the driver's seat of her Ford Explorer,
              tosses the bag of groceries on the passenger seat...
 
              She starts the engine...
 
              "MR. SANDMAN" blares over the radio... scares the shit out of
              her.  Keri quickly changes stations... heads back to the
              school.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. CARTER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
 
              Sparsely decorated.  Scattered Chinese food containers litter
              the counters.
 
              On a glass dining room table, a table dozen cardboard boxes,
              "DR. LOOMIS" in black sharpie scrawled across their sides.
 
              The CAMERA PANS across the table where...
 
              CARTER
 
              sits, eyes glazed over... shuffling through a stack of
              photographs.
 
              ON THE PHOTOGRAPHS
 
              Of a young Michael Meyers playing with a fire truck in the
              den... running through sprinklers in the backyard... riding
              horses at the county fair... no signs of the evil lurking
              inside.
 
              CARTER sets the photographs aside, digs through a file box...
              pulls out a film canister marked "MEYERS' HOME MOVIES."
 
              ON A PROJECTOR
 
              CARTER threads the Super 8 film through it, turns it on...
              images of a young Michael Meyers are projected on a bare wall
              in the darkened room.

              CARTER settles into the recliner, fights to stay awake...
 
              THE SHAPE APPEARS IN FRONT OF THE WALL.
 
              The home movies projected on his pale mask.  He moves slowly
              toward the sleeping CARTER, a knife in his grip.
 
              The SHAPE raises the knife to CARTER's throat, slices it from
              ear to ear.  CARTER grabs his throat, blood gushes through
              his fingers.  Then...
 
              THE TELEPHONE RINGS.
 
              CARTER WAKES UP.
 
              Gasps for air... he feels for his throat... no blood, all is
              well.
 
              The Super 8 films slaps against the projector, the reel now
              over...
 
              CARTER catches his breath... surveys the room... he is alone.
              He picks up the phone --
 
                                  CARTER
                            (into phone)
                        Carter.

                        It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
 
                                  CARTER
                        Where?
 
                                  BLAKE
                        The cemetery...
 
                                  CARTER
                        Yeah, alright... I'll be there in
                        ten.
 
              Carter hangs up the phone, massages his throat...

              CLOSE ON THE PALE WHITE HALLOWEEN MASK
 
              CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a mannequin sporting the mask and
              dark overalls made notorious by Michael Meyers... its arm
              posed high in the air, wielding a meat cleaver.
 
              Gathered around the mannequin is the gang:

              Linda is in the arms of her boyfriend, SHANE McCLOUD... a
              tall and spindly teen, book smart and street dumb...
 
              John riffles through a rack of Halloween costumes.  Molly
              leans against a nearby counter... she checks her watch,
              visibly uncomfortable being here at all.
 
              EDDIE CATERO, two years out of high school and still wearing
              his letterman jacket, 'Nuff said.
 
              He stands proudly by his display, nursing a beer... his arm
              draped around Amy, who's painting her nails with a nail
              polish plucked from a nearby display...
 
                                  EDDIE
                            (re: the display)
                        Pretty wicked, huh?
 
                                  LINDA
                        I think it's twisted.
 
                                  EDDIE
                        This coming from the girl with a
                        stake through her tongue.
 
                                  LINDA
                        You're glorifying the big creep.
 
                                  SHANE
                        Besides, it's historically
                        inaccurate.
 
                                  EDDIE
                        What the fuck are you talking
                        about?
 
                                  SHANE
                        Michael Meyers never used a meat
                        cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
 
                                  EDDIE
                        Who are you, the serial killer
                        police?  What difference does it
                        make?
 
                                  SHANE
                        It's not historically accurate,
                        that's all.
 
                                  AMY
                        He could be holding a swizzle
                        stick, it still gives me the
                        willies.

                                  JOHN
                        Don't worry... I hear he only
                        kills virgins.
 
                                  SHANE
                        Another historical inaccuracy.
 
                                  EDDIE
                        Would somebody shut this guy up?
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Come on, we better get back before
                        Mrs. Sullivan makes her rounds.
 
              Linda looks at her watch.
 
                                  LINDA
                        Oh, shit.  Molly's right.  It's
                        eleven-thirty.
 
              The gang heads for the front door...
 
                                  AMY
                        You guys go on.  Eddie's gonna
                        take me back after he closes up.
 
              Bells hanging from the door JINGLE as they exit...  John
              turns to them as he leaves --
 
                                  JOHN
                        Condoms are on aisle four...
 
                                  EDDIE
                        Out.
 
              Eddie pushes John out the door, shuts it behind him...
 
              EXT. FREEMAN'S DRUGSTORE
 
              The group moves down the deserted street, headed for
              Hillcrest.  John's arm around Molly.  Shane's around Linda...

                        How do you like the color?  It's
                        called "Bloodshed Red."
 
                                  EDDIE
                        Yeah, yeah... looks good...
 
              Eddie grabs Amy by the waist, pulls her in... kisses her
              passionately.
 
                                  EDDIE
                            (continuing)
                        Let's go in back and check out the

              Eddie and Amy head to the --
 
              INT. BACK ROOM
 
              Eddie and Amy get hot and heavy amongst a room full of
              cardboard boxes, Halloween costumes, and mask...
 
              As Eddie prepares to do the one-hand bra release...
 
              JINGLE-JINGLE.
 
              The bells hung on the front door chime.
 
                                  EDDIE
                        Shit.  Can't people read?  Don't
                        move.  I'll be right back.
 
              Eddie exits, leaving behind a half-naked Amy.

              Eddie moves toward the front of the store, heads down the
              center aisle.  He hears the SHUFFLING OF FEET in the aisle
              next to him...

              Eddie rounds the corner, runs smack into --
 
              THE SHAPE.

              It's only the mannequin, which isn't where Eddie left it...
              arm poised high in the air, knife missing.
 
              Eddie turns around to see --
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              standing right behind him, wielding the meat cleaver.

              outside the door... she throws on her blouse, peeks outside.

                        around.
 
              Still nothing... Amy cautiously moves into the store, looking
              for her missing partner... she passes
 
              THE MICHAEL MEYERS MANNEQUIN
 
                                  AMY

              sprawled on the floor, the meat cleaver buried in the middle
              of his forehead... eyes wide open in terror!
 
              Amy SCREAMS... can barely stand... she stumbles to the front
              of the door... it's locked!

              The Michael Meyers mannequin behind her comes to life, begins
              to move toward her...
 
              Amy beats frantically on the glass door, struggling to free
              the lock... she turns to see...
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              closing in behind her... she SCREAMS.
 
              The SHAPE attacks, grabs Amy by the back of the neck...
              pushes her face through the glass door, cuts it to bits...
 
              He lifts Amy high into the air, she struggles to free
              herself... the Shape impales her body on a large shard of
              glass.
 
              ON Amy's feet... dangling a foot off the ground... then...
 
              Her body goes completely limp... lifeless.
 
              ON Amy's hand... blood cascades down her fingers, matches the
              shade of her nail polish...
 
              The SHAPE looks at her breathless body quizzically...

              Carter looks down at his feet, finds himself standing in the
              middle of a group of flowers... he quickly hops back onto the
              grass...

                        ya' know.  Especially those Irish
                        folk.  They push up the daises
                        like a son-of-a-bitch...
 
                                  CARTER
                        I'll remember that.
 
                                  FRED
                        Hell, I can tell you where every
                        Mick is buried by the ground cover
                        growing above 'em.
 
              Fred shines his flashlight on a distant grave.
 
                                  FRED
                            (continuing)
                        Irish...
                            (shining the beam on
                             another grave)
                        ...Irish...
 
              They stop in front of a gravesite... TOMBSTONE missing...
              patchy grass covers the grave.
 
                                  FRED
                            (continuing)
                        Never could get anything to grow
                        cover this one...
 
                                  BLAKE
                        And you're sure this is Laurie
                        Strode's grave?
 
                                  FRED
                        Sure as I'm standing here.
 
              Fred shines the beam of the flashlight on an adjacent
              headstone...
 
                                  FRED
                            (continuing)
                        Buried her daughter right next to
                        her not too long ago.  You don't
                        suppose that Meyers fella took the
                        tombstone?

                                  CARTER
                        Probably just a couple of kids
                        playing a Halloween prank.
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Tee-peeing a house, yes.  A bag of
                        burning shit on a porch, maybe.
                        Digging up tombstone?  I don't
                        think so.
 
              Carter shrugs his shoulders, take a drag off his cigarette.
 
                                  CARTER
                        I'm going to bed.
 
              Carter heads back to his car.  Blake runs after him...
 
                                  BLAKE
                        That's it?
 
                                  CARTER
                        Care to join me?
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Come on, Carter.  You know it's
                        Michael.
 
                                  CARTER
                        What do you want me to do, put out
                        an A.P.B. on a man in overalls
                        wearing a white mask dragging a
                        headstone?
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Yes.
 
                                  CARTER
                        Sweet dreams, Blake.
 
              Carter climbs into his car, heads for home...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
 
              Keri tosses and turns in her bed, unable to exorcise the
              demons from her mind... eyes wide open, watches the moonlight
              cast the shadows of dancing leaves on the ceiling above her...
 
              Then, the shadow of something altogether unnatural appears
              above her...
 
              THE SHADOW OF A MAN
 
              hair tattered and tousled by the wind.
 
              ON Keri lying frozen in fear, eyes unblinking.

              THE SILHOUETTE
 
              grows larger, nearly engulfs the entire ceiling... then
              suddenly disappears from view... the dancing leaves return.
 
              CLANK!
 
              A noise from outside her window.  FOOTSTEPS quickly make
              their way around the house...
 
              Keri jumps out of her skin, holds her breath...
 
              A JIGGLING SOUND emanates from the living room, as if
              someone's trying to get in through the front door...
 
              Keri jumps out of her bed, slides a metal box out from under
              the bed... pulls a SMITH AND WESSON from inside... heads
              for --
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM
 
              Keri moves silently through the hallway into the living room,
              gun at the ready... hands trembling... eyes locked on the
              front door as --
 
              THE DOORKNOB
 
              slowly twists and turns... the SHADOW of a man behind the
              curtain of the window flanking the side of the door.
 
              KERI
 
              raises the gun... uses both hands to steady her aim... her
              breathing becoming more shallow with each passing second...
 
              THE DOOR
 
              swings open revealing...
 
              JOHN
 
              house key in hand... busted.
 
              KERI
 
              lowers the gun, fights back in tears...
 
              John closes the door... if he's surprised that his mother's
              pointing a gun in his face, he doesn't show it...
 
                                  KERI
                        Shit, John!  What the hell were
                        you doing out there?!

                                  JOHN
                        Nothing.
 
                                  KERI
                        You're kidding with that answer,
                        right?
 
                                  JOHN
                        I just went for a walk.  It's no
                        big deal.
 
                                  KERI
                        Wrong.  There are rules in this
                        house and you're going to follow
                        them whether you like it or not.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
 
                                  KERI
                        It's an option.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Well, maybe if you'd let me live
                        in the dorms, I wouldn't have to
                        sneak out to spend time with my
                        friends.
 
                                  KERI
                        Oh, so now it's my fault?
 
                                  JOHN
                        Just forget it...
 
              John storms down the hall, disappears into his bedroom...
              slams the door behind him.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER
 
              Keri enters the room, passes by the window... glances out
              into the night and sees --
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              standing between sheets that blow in the clothesline.
 
              KERI
 
              closes her eyes, takes a deep breath... opens them... now
              both the Shape and the sheets blowing in the clothesline have
              VANISHED.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING
 
              Keri substituting for the absentee English Lit teacher.  Mr.
              Elliot.
 
              A STUDENT has just finished her oral report and heads back to
              her seat.
 
              Keri stands, crosses to the chalkboard --
 
                                  KERI
                        I'm sure Mr. Elliot will go over
                        this when he returns on Monday,
                        but Julie hit on a very important
                        aspect of Virgil's "The Aeniad."
 
              She scrawls the word "FATE" across its surface...
 
                                  KERI
                            (continuing)
                        F-A-T-E.  Fate.  The Romans
                        believed in the three goddesses of
                        Fate, called "the Fate."  Nona,
                        Decuma, and Morta.  These
                        goddesses determined your fate.
                        They were to blame when things
                        went wrong, and were to be praised
                        when --
 
              Keri passes in front of the classroom, glances out the window
              and sees --
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              standing behind the gates of the academy, waiting patiently
              for his chance... eyes burning a hold right through her.
 
              THE STUDENTS
 
              wait for Keri to complete her thought... mumble softly
              amongst themselves...
 
              KERI
 
              closes her eyes for a moment, takes a deep breath... looks
              outside again... the Shape is STILL THERE!
 
              THE BELL RINGS.
 
              The students make a mad dash for the hall.

              KERI
 
              moves swiftly through the throng of students, pushing
              bewildered pupils aside as she makes her way to the school
              entrance...

              EXT. HILLCREST ACADEMY - DAY
 
              Keri emerges from the building, moves across the campus
              toward the iron gates... runs smack into --
 
              WILL
 
              throws his arms around her waist...
 
                                  WILL
                        Whoa... what's the hurry?  I'm not
                        going anywhere...
 
              Keri doesn't respond, is too busy looking over Will's
              shoulder --
 
              KERI'S POV of the gate... the SHAPE has once again
              disappeared.
 
              Keri eyes the perimeter of the campus, searching for her long
              lost brother.
 
                                  WILL
                            (continuing)
                        Hey, you alright?
 
                                  KERI
                            (distracted)
                        What?
 
                                  WILL
                        What are you looking at?
 
                                  KERI
                        I'm fine.  I just need to lie
                        down...
 
              Keri breaks free from Will's grip, heads toward the faculty
              housing, determined.  Will watches her leave, face laced with
              concern...

              Keri climbs atop a foot stool, retrieves a BOTTLE of Vodka
              concealed behind bags of flour on the top shelf of the
              pantry...
 
              She spins off the top... brings the lip of the bottle to her
              mouth, hands trembling...
 
              She stops short of taking the drink, bring the bottle down
              from her lips...
 
              Keri climbs off the foot stool, crosses to the kitchen sink
              and pours the Vodka down the drain...

              Blake sits behind her desk leafing through the double
              homicide case file, looking for some stone that's been left
              unturned...
 
              She removes a FILE FOLDER from an evidence bag, "KERI TATE"
              in type across the index tape...
 
              Blake opens it... still empty.
 
              ON THE FILE FOLDER.
 
              The light from her desk lamp falls across the open folder,
              reveals a series of indentations in the left hand corner of
              the manilla paper...
 
              BLAKE
 
              struggles to make out the ghost writing... grabs a pencil,
              moves the side of the lead swiftly across the folder...
 
              "6089244325"
 
              The numbers pop out against the shaded background...
 
              BLAKE
 
              jots the numbers down on a nearby pad.
 
              ON THE PAD
 
              Blake tries formatting the numbers into a Social Security
              number: "608-92-44325" too many numbers.  She scratches it
              out...

              She tries again... puts parenthesis around the first three
              numbers and a dash after the sixth number:  "(608) 924-

                                  CARTER
                            (into phone)
                        Carter.
 
                                  BLAKE
                        It's Blake.  How do you feel about
                        Wisconsin?
 
              ON Carter's puzzled expression...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. FREEMAN'S DRUGSTORE - AFTERNOON
 
              A YELLOW SCHOOL BUS
 
              parked across the street, filled to capacity with students.
 
              ON John watching from outside the school bus as

              AN OFFICER
 
              strings yellow crime scene tape across the front of the
              drugstore.
 
              MOLLY
 
              stands next to John, arm around his waist... watching
              curiously...
 
              LINDA
 
              leans against the side of the bus next to Shane...
 
                                  LINDA
                        Look, they're staring right at us.
 
                                  SHANE
                            (to John)
                        You think your mom knows we snuck
                        out last night?
 
                                  JOHN
                        Nah, I didn't tell her where I
                        went.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Is that all you guys can think
                        about?  Amy never came back last
                        night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
 
                                  LINDA
                        Better her than me.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        You're unbelievable.
 
                                  SHANE
                        Linda's right.  I have Yale to
                        think about.  Amy's going to the
                        Barbizon School of Beauty -- if
                        they let her retake her boards...
 
              ON BRUCE CLARK, a young deputy ducks under the yellow tape,
              approaches...
 
              KERI
 
              stands in front of a squad car, craning her neck to get a
              look at the proceedings...

                                  KERI
                        Bruce... what's going on?  The
                        kids are here to pick out their
                        costumes for the festival.
 
                                  DEPUTY CLARK
                        Better take 'em to Virgil's
                        downtown.  We got a dead body in
                        there.
 
              Keri's heart skips a beat, she tries to digest the news...
 
                                  KERI
                        A dead body?
 
                                  DEPUTY CLARK
                        It's Amy Kramer.
 
                                  KERI
                        My god...
 
                                  DEPUTY CLARK
                        Pretty messy.  Parents have
                        already been notified.  Our office
                        has been trying to get a hold of
                        you...
 
              Keri fears the worse, tries to hold herself together...
 
                                  KERI
                        Do you know who did this?
 
                                  DEPUTY CLARK
                        Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up
                        for work this morning... parents
                        say he never came home last night.
                        Car's still missing.
 
                                  KERI
                            (wishful)
                        Think Eddie had something to do
                        with it?
 
                                  DEPUTY CLARK
                        Doesn't look good.
 
              Deputy Clark turns in the direction of the bus...
 
                                  DEPUTY CLARK
                            (continuing)
                        You best keep those students
                        locked behind those gates of
                        yours... got ourselves a
                        cold-blooded killer on the
                        loose.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. HILLCREST ACADEMY - ESTABLISHING
 
              Night.  Wind assaults the trees.  Lights illuminate a dozen
              dorm windows.
 
              EXT. GATES - SAME TIME
 
              A compact CAR pulls up behind the gates, high beams
              illuminating the...
 
              GUARD HOUSE
 
              There is an entrance on either side of the guard house...
              inside sits Hattie.
 
              She cups her hands over her eyes, protecting them from the
              glare of the auto's headlights.  She checks --
 
              A MONITOR
 
              embedded in the console in front of her... black and white
              image of the car idling outside the gates illuminates the
              screen.
 
              ON Hattie, unable to make out the identity of the driver.
              She steps out of the guard house...
 
              EXT. GATES
 
              Through the gate, she sees a figure slumped behind the
              wheel...
 
                                  HATTIE
                            (calling off)
                        Who's there?
 
              No response.
 
                                  HATTIE
                            (continuing)
                        Please identify yourself, young
                        man.
 
              Still nothing.  Hattie doesn't know what to do.
 
              She opens the gate with her gate key and walks through... she
              approaches the car.  The trees rustle nearby.  She takes a
              look, spooking herself.  It is, after all, Halloween.

              She crosses to the driver's side window... looks inside to
              find the body of --
 
              EDDIE CATERO
 
              the costume shop victim, slouched behind the wheel... face a
              bloodied mess.
 
                                  HATTIE
                        My Lord...
 
              Hattie stumbles backward... she's doesn't see THE SHAPE pass
              through the open gates behind her.
 
              She crosses back to the --
 
              INT. GUARD HOUSE
 
              Hattie quickly presses a BUTTON on the console in front of
              her, automatically closing the wrought iron gates outside...
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              stands at the entrance to the left of guard house.  Hattie's
              back to him.
 
              She picks up the phone... no dial tone.  She jiggles the
              receiver... comes up short.
 
              CLINK.  A noise from outside.
 
              Hattie spins around, faces the left entrance... no one in
              sight.
 
                                  HATTIE
                            (softly)
                        Hello?
 
              No answer.  Hattie crosses to the left entrance, shuts the
              door... throws the bolt.
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              appears behind Hattie... now standing at the entrance to the
              right of the guard house.
 
              CLINK.  Another noise, source unknown...
 
              Hattie spins around, faces the right entrance... the Shape
              has vanished.
 
              Hattie crosses to the right entrance, shuts the door... locks
              it.  Now secured safely inside the guard house, Hattie
              crosses to a CB Radio...

              She turns it on... dials the emergency channel... is
              distracted by --
 
              THE CAR
 
              outside the gates... its headlights suddenly extinguish.
 
              ON Hattie, squints through through window in the car's
              direction...
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              emerges from the shadows behind her... wraps the CB cord
              around her neck... Hattie struggles to free herself... her
              face pressed up against the glass...
 
              The Shape brandishes a knife... stabs her repeatedly in the
              back... ends the struggle.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. BELL TOWER - CONTINUOUS
 
              Wally, the custodian, climbs the four flights of stairs to
              the massive bell partially enclosed at its top... he tugs on
              the rope dangling from the bell...
 
              THE BELL RINGS.
 
              Its sound resonating across the campus.
 
              ON THE DORMS.
 
              The windows, once lit, are now extinguished, leaving the
              dorms shrouded in total darkness... lights out.
 
              INT. DORM - MOLLY'S ROOM
 
              The sound of the ringing bell echoes softly through the
              room...
 
              Molly lies in her bed, unable to sleep, eyes to the
              ceiling... her pajama clad body partially covered by a sheet.
 
              ON "LURCH," THE SCHOOL DOG
 
              lying beside Molly's bed, also asleep.
 
              Molly hears the RUSTLING of bushes outside her window... she
              turns in its direction to see --

              THE BUSHES
 
              moving forcefully, their branches scratching wildly against
              glass...
 
              MOLLY
 
              sits up in bed, her eyes glued to the window... she slowly
              gets out of bed, moves toward it... leans against the
              windowpane.
 
              ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDOW
 
              of the campus, bathed in moonlight... wind howls through the
              trees... leaves scurry across the grounds.
 
              BANG!  BANG!
 
              A hand raps on her window.  Molly jumps out of her skin.
 
              ON JOHN
 
              standing outside her window, motions her to open it.  She
              does, sticks her head out...
 
                                  MOLLY
                            (whispering)
                        What are you doing here?!
 
                                  JOHN
                            (whispering)
                        I came to see you.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        I can see that.
                            (a beat)
                        Why?
 
                                  JOHN
                        Can I come in?
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Then you come out here.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Then I'll get caught.
 
                                  JOHN
                            (louder)
                        Well, I'm not going until I talk
                        to you.

                                  MOLLY
                        Alright.  I'll come out.  Just be
                        quiet.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. HILLCREST ACADEMY - FIVE MINUTES LATER
 
              Molly and John meander through the wooded acreage along the
              perimeter of the campus, hand-in-hand... the school buildings
              completely obfuscated by the surrounding foliage.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        You really think Eddie killed her?
 
                                  JOHN
                        You saw that Michael Meyers
                        display.  You've got to be pretty
                        twisted to come up with something
                        like that.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        I guess.  It's just hard to
                        believe.
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              appears behind them in the distance, standing beside a
              tree... watching... waiting.  It seems as though with each
              cut the SHAPE moves closer...
 
                                  JOHN
                        You look kind of cold.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        I'm okay.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Here, take my jacket.
 
              John takes off his letterman jacket, drapes it over her
              shoulders...
 
              The SHAPE disappears from view, into the thicket.
 
                                  JOHN
                            (continuing)
                        Better?
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Yeah.

              John gazes into Molly's eyes, her moves in closer... they
              engage in a passionate kiss... John's hands begin to find
              there way up her blouse when --
 
              A PAIR OF HANDS
 
              grabs them by the back of their necks, pulls them to their
              feet!  Shit!  Molly SCREAMS... the CAMERA PULLS BACK TO
              REVEAL...
 
              KERI
 
              with a firm grip on them both, a disapproving look painted
              across her face.
 
                                  KERI
                        All right... fun's over.
 
              EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - MINUTES LATER
 
              Keri moves across the campus, back to the school... Molly and
              John in tow.  They pass the group of faculty houses...
 
                                  KERI
                            (to John)
                        Go take a cold shower... I'll deal
                        with you later.
 
              John heads for his house, waves good-bye to Molly... she
              waves back sheepishly.
 
              Keri and Molly continue toward the dorms...
 
                                  KERI
                            (continuing)
                        Molly, of all the people... if I
                        can't trust my resident assistant,
                        then what?
 
                                  MOLLY
                        I know.  I'm really, really sorry,
                        Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the
                        job... it's the only way I can
                        afford to stay here.
 
                                  KERI
                        Okay, tell you what... you can
                        still be the school R.A., but no
                        dance tomorrow night.
 
                                  MOLLY
                            (relieved)
                        Okay... thank you.

              Molly gives Keri a hug...
 
                                  KERI
                        Something tells me I won't get the
                        same reaction when I tell John...
 
              The two are completely unaware of...
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              watching from the thicket, the moonlight reflected off his
              pale white mask.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. HILLCREST ACADEMY - ESTABLISHING - MORNING
 
              STUDENTS scurry from their dorms to the adjacent school
              building, racing to make it to their a.m. classes on time...
 
              SUPER the legend:  "October 31st.  Halloween."
 
              INT. GYMNASIUM - MORNING
 
              A group of students take laps in the indoor swimming pool
              beneath the retracted gymnasium floor.
 
              The gym is decorated for the Halloween festival that night...
 
              Their coach, MRS. ROCKWELL, supervises from poolside, whistle
              dangling around her neck.
 
              ON Molly, Linda, and SARAH LOCKE, the resident gossip with
              beauty pageant good looks, as they complete their final lap.
 
              They congregate in the shallow end, their goggles perched on
              their heads...
 
                                  MOLLY
                        I feel like everyone's staring at
                        me.
 
                                  SARAH
                        News travels fast.  It's all over
                        school about you and John getting
                        busted in the woods by Miss Tate.
 
                                  LINDA
                        Don't suppose you had anything to
                        do with that, motor mouth.
 
                                  SARAH
                        Shut up, freak.

              Mrs. Rockwell blows her WHISTLE... the girls in the pool wait
              for her instruction.
 
                                  MRS. ROCKWELL
                        Alright, I know you girls have the
                        big Halloween dance tonight, so
                        I'm letting you go ten minutes
                        early today.
 
                                  LINDA
                            (under her breath)
                        How generous of her.
 
              Molly, Linda, and Sarah start to climb out of the pool...
 
                                  MRS. ROCKWELL
                        Sarah, since you took it upon
                        yourself to arrive ten minutes
                        late today, you can stay the extra
                        ten minutes.
 
                                  SARAH
                        But Mrs. Rockwell...
 
                                  MRS. ROCKWELL
                        Use the time to practice your
                        drive.  You looked real sloppy out
                        there today.
 
                                  LINDA
                        Ooooh, busted.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Big time.  And news travels fast.
                        Wouldn't be surprised if the whole
                        school knows about this one by
                        tonight.
 
              Sarah flips them the finger...
 
                                  SARAH
                        Smile at the birdie, ladies.
 
              Molly and Linda head toward the locker room...
 
                                  LINDA
                        Sarah Locke.  What a major bitch.
                        You know she waxes her stomach?
 
              Molly and Linda exit the gymnasium...
 
              ON Sarah as she climbs out of the pool... walks to the diving
              board on the other end of the deserted gym... places the
              goggles over her eyes...

              She dives into the water... swims underwater toward the
              shallow end... she heads toward the surface...
 
              SARAH POV
 
              The SHAPE is standing poolside... his image warped by the
              rolling water, bobbing and swaying with the current.
 
              Sarah breaks through the surface of the water, catches her
              breath... throws off her goggles, scans the gym...
 
              ANGLE ON THE GYMNASIUM
 
              Empty.  Not a soul in sight.
 
              Sarah shrugs it off, climbs back out of the pool... heads for
              the diving board...
 
              She dives into the water... as she emerges in the shallow end
              the lights in the gym extinguish... leaving her in darkness.
 
                                  SARAH
                            (calling out)
                        Hey!  There's someone in here!
 
              No response.  Sarah moves toward the stairs...
 
                                  SARAH
                            (continuing)
                        Hell-o!  I'm in here!
 
              She grabs the railing, starts to pull herself out of the
              pool, when suddenly...
 
              THE SHAPE GRABS HER BY THE NECK.
 
              Pushes her back into the pool... holds her head under the
              water... her arms flail wildly as she struggles for breath...
 
              The Shape flashes a knife... slices into flesh...
 
              Sarah's body goes limp... the SHAPE releases her... her
              lifeless body floats face down in the bloody water.
 
              WIDE OF THE GYMNASIUM
 
              The SHAPE has disappeared from view.
 
              CLANG-CLANG-CLANG.
 
              The gym floor begins to close over the pool, covering the
              floating corpse inside of it.

              EXT. HILLCREST ACADEMY - DAY
 
              Keri moves across campus, notices --
 
              THE MASSIVE WROUGHT IRON GATES
 
              open to the single lane road exiting the school.
 
              Keri eyes the GUARDHOUSE that sits at the entrance, indignant.
 
              INT. GUARD HOUSE
 
              Keri enters, the guard house is empty...
 
                                  KERI
                            (calling off)
                        Hattie?
 
              She's nowhere in sight...
 
                                  KERI
                            (continuing)
                        Now where is she?
 
              Keri pushes a BUTTON on the console in front of her.
 
              THE GATES
 
              slowly begin to close...
 
              KERI
 
              exits the guard house, closes the door behind her... heads
              back to the school.
 
              CLOSE ON:  A COFFEE MUG
 
              sits on the console, filled with a deep red liquid...
 
              PLOP!
 
              A drop of blood falls from
 
              THE CEILING
 
              Blood soaks the drop-ceiling... Hattie's corpse hidden from
              view.
 
              CLANG!
 
              The GATES SHUT tight...
 
                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. HEADMASTER'S OFFICE - LATER THAT AFTERNOON
 
              Keri walks into her office, shuts the door behind her...
              turns to find
 
              CARTER
 
              seated in front of her desk... Blake stands beside him,
              looking out the office window...
 
              Keri jumps at the sight of the uninvited guests --
 
                                  KERI
                            (startled)
                        Shit!
 
              Carter stands, takes one look at her and knows he's hit the
              jackpot...
 
                                  CARTER
                        I'll be damned.
 
                                  KERI
                        Do I know you?
 
                                  BLAKE
                        We're sorry to startle you, Miss
                        Tate.
 
                                  CARTER
                        The door was open, so we let
                        ourselves in.
 
                                  KERI
                        I can see that.  Who are you?
 
              Carter flashes a smile, then his badge...
 
                                  CARTER
                        Detective Carter from the
                        Haddonfield P.D.
 
                                  BLAKE
                        Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
 
              Keri knows exactly why they're here, her dual lives are
              crossing paths... they've found little sister.
 
                                  CARTER
                        Mind if we sit down?
 
                                  KERI
                        I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very
                        busy.

                                  CARTER
                        Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a
                        few questions?
 
                                  KERI
                        Detective...
 
                                  CARTER
                        Carter.
 
                                  KERI
                        ... I think it would be best if
                        you both left.
 
                                  CARTER
                        Might want to stop and think about
                        the safety of your students, Miss
                        Tate.
 
                                  KERI
                        I never stop thinking about it,
                        Detective.
                            (pointing out the window)
                        The only way in or out of this
                        school is through that gate, and
                        it is secured at all times.
 
                                  CARTER
                        Funny, we just drove right in.
 
                                  KERI
                        Well, I can assure you, it won't
                        happen again.  Thanks for your
                        concern.  Goodbye.
 
              Carter starts out... turns back toward Keri.
 
                                  CARTER
                        Has anyone ever told you, you bear
                        a striking resemblance to Laurie
                        Strode?
 
              Keri glares at him for a beat... the walls around her are
              collapsing.
 
                                  KERI
                        Never heard of her.
 
              Blake removes a business card from her pocket, a phone number
              scribbled across its face.  She places it on the desk...

                                  BLAKE
                        The Ferndale P.D. is setting up a
                        roadblock couple miles down the
                        road.  They think they're looking
                        for a jealous boyfriend gone
                        mad... I think differently.  We
                        can protect you..
 
              Keri doesn't flinch, motions toward the door.  Carter and
              Blake start out --
 
                                  KERI
                        You can't stop him.
 
              Carter stops, turns back toward her...
 
                                  CARTER
                        Not without some help.
 
              Carter and Blake exit, shut the door behind them...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. GATES - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER
 
              Carter and Blake in a rental car to the side of the road just
              outside the gates.
 
              Blake emerges from the passenger side... Carter tosses her a
              walkie-talkie...
 
                                  CARTER
                        Don't be a stranger...
 
              Carter pulls away from the school...
 
              Blake hooks the walkie-talkie to her side, heads back into
              the campus, passes --
 
              A CAR
 
              hidden behind the bushes, Eddie's rotting corpse locked
              inside...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM - A HALF HOUR LATER
 
              Lots of nubile young bodies moving to and fro, changing out
              of sweaty gym clothes into dry attire.
 
              ON Molly, standing in front of a fogged-up mirror, straight
              from the shower... towel tucked firmly around her chest.

              Linda stands to her right, putting on her make-up... also in
              a towel.
 
                                  LINDA
                        Shane's going as a condom.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        I thought you were allergic to
                        latex.
 
                                  LINDA
                        I'll pop a Benadryl.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        You think they'll let him in
                        dressed like that?
 
                                  LINDA
                        Oh, they're so stupid... I'll just
                        tell them he's going as a sausage
                        casing.
 
              Linda swipes her palm across the fogged-up mirror, wiping
              away the steam...
 
              ON the MIRROR.  In its reflection we see Molly and Linda...
              then --
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              appears from the cloud of steam behind them!
 
              Other STUDENTS spot the intruder, run SCREAMING from the
              locker room.
 
              The SHAPE grabs Linda from behind... wields a knife... slits
              her throat... blood cascades down her neck, 'blemishes the
              towel around her bust.
 
              ON Molly, immobile.  Terrified.  Unable to scream.
 
              LINDA'S
 
              lifeless body drops to the floor... eyes wide open in terror.
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              shifts his attention to
 
              MOLLY
 
              gets her legs back, runs like hell... runs smack into

              KERI
 
              at the locker room entrance... grabs Molly in her arms.
 
                                  KERI
                        Whoa.  What's going on in there?
 
              Molly is on the verge of hysterics --
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Linda!  He killed Linda!
 
                                  KERI
                        Who?!
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Michael Meyers!
 
              Keri darts into the locker room...
 
                                  MOLLY
                            (continuing)
                        Miss Tate, wait!
 
              Molly follows her, stands in the relative safety of the
              doorway... Keri walks in to find --
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              standing above Linda's lifeless body... knife raised high in
              the air, dripping blood.
 
              ON Keri, her legs buckle... she struggles to stay standing.
 
                                  KERI
                        Michael, nooooooo!
 
              Then, an even more bizarre sight --
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              starts to CHUCKLE... his shoulders bobbing up and down...
              bending over slightly at the waist.
 
              LINDA'S
 
              lifeless body starts trembling with laughter.
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              reaches up to his mask, pulls it off... it's JOHN!

                                  JOHN
                        That was classic...
                            (imitating Keri)
                        "Michael, nooooooo!"
 
              LINDA
 
              sits up, licks some blood off her fingers.
 
                                  LINDA
                        Mmmm.  Anyone got some French
                        fries?
 
              John and Linda cracks up.
 
              ON Keri, mortified... the sight of her son dressed like his
              homicidal uncle is almost too much for her to bear...
 
              John and Linda are too busy revealing in their prank to
              notice...
 
                                  LINDA
                            (continuing)
                        Molly, you should have seen your
                        face...
 
              Keri crosses over to John... SLAPS him across the face, hard.
              John reels, probably the first time Keri's laid a hand on
              him...
 
                                  KERI
                        Home... NOW!
 
              Keri grabs John by the arm, pushes him past Molly...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
 
              John sits on the sofa.  Will stands behind him... neither
              sure exactly what they're doing there.
 
              Keri paces in front of them...
 
                                  JOHN
                        I'm sorry, alright?  It was just
                        a stupid joke.
 
                                  KERI
                        Will, sit down...
 
              Will does.

                                  KERI
                            (continuing)
                        There's something I have to tell
                        you both.  It's going to sound
                        strange...
 
                                  WILL
                        What?
 
                                  KERI
                        My name hasn't always been Keri
                        Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
 
                                  WILL
                        You're right.  It does sound
                        strange.
 
                                  JOHN
                        You some kind of fugitive or
                        something?
 
                                  KERI
                        I was trying to get away from
                        someone.
 
                                  WILL
                        Who?
 
                                  KERI
                        Michael Meyers.
 
                                  WILL
                        The serial killer?
 
                                  KERI
                        He's my brother.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Now you're joking, right?
 
                                  KERI
                        Afraid not.  You can pick your
                        friends, but you can't pick your
                        family.
 
                                  WILL
                        Keri, have you been...
 
              Will mimes taking a drink from a bottle...
 
                                  KERI
                        No, Will, this isn't the alcohol
                        talking.  It's the truth.

                                  WILL
                        I can't believe this is happening.
 
                                  KERI
                        Shit happens.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Wait a minute... slow down...
                        you're telling me Michael Meyers
                        is my uncle?
 
                                  KERI
                        Yes.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Any other psychotic relatives I
                        should know about?  Jason?  Freddy
                        Krueger?
 
                                  KERI
                        No.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Why didn't you tell me?
 
                                  KERI
                        I was trying to protect you from
                        this...
 
              Keri holds up this trademark Halloween mask, a tuft of hair
              tightly in her grip...
 
              John crosses to the front door, opens it...
 
                                  KERI
                            (continuing)
                        Where are you going?
 
                                  JOHN
                        I don't know.
 
              John exits.  Keri starts after him, Will grabs her by the
              arm...
 
                                  WILL
                        You just dropped a shitload on
                        him... give him some time to
                        digest it.
 
                                  KERI
                        Are you going to leave, too?
 
                                  WILL
                        Never.

              Keri nuzzles her head against Will's chest...
 
                                  WILL
                            (continuing)
                        So you're really Michael Meyers'
                        sister?
 
                                  KERI
                        Yeah.
 
                                  WILL
                        Do we have to invite him to the
                        wedding?
 
              Keri laughs, more out of relief than anything...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. ROADSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON
 
              A couple of Ferndale P.D. SQUAD CARS flank either side of the
              road.
 
              ROADBLOCKS
 
              lined up across the asphalt deny access to the roadway
              leading to Hillcrest.
 
              ON Carter, leaning against a squad car.  Deputy Clark stands
              next to him.  Carter lights up a cigarette...
 
                                  DEPUTY CLARK
                        Don't worry, Detective.  No one's
                        getting up to that school.
 
                                  CARTER
                        And this is the only way up to
                        Hillcrest?
 
                                  DEPUTY CLARK
                        Sure is.  Unless your boy can fly.
 
                                  CARTER
                        I hope not.
 
              Deputy Clark laughs, Carter doesn't... just takes another
              drag off his cigarette...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. HILLCREST ACADEMY - NIGHT
 
              Darkness falls... Halloween night.

              COSTUMED STUDENTS
 
              make their way inside the gymnasium.
 
              ON A BAND OF MISFITS.
 
              Freshman, armed with cartons of eggs and rolls of toilet
              paper, emerge stealthily from the wooded acreage... they
              attack the Hillcrest Administrative Building.
 
              ON WALLY.
 
              The school custodian heads for the bell tower... spots the
              young punks across campus defacing what he works so hard to
              preserve.
 
              He takes off in their direction.
 
                                  WALLY
                            (calling off)
                        Hey, you kids!  Knock that off!
                        Get over here!
 
              The boys see Wally headed in their direction... they
              scramble, head back for the woods... a few of them throw eggs
              in Wally's direction.
 
              Wally makes it about halfway across campus before his old
              ticker kicks in... he has to stop... catches his breath.
 
                                  WALLY
                            (continuing)
                        Damn kids.
 
              Wally turns around, heads back to the bell tower.
 
              One by one the freshman disappear into the thicket... one of
              the boys runs smack into...
 
              THE SHAPE.
 
              The boys stares up at him, startled... he darts after his
              friends... the SHAPE continues toward Hillcrest.
 
              INT. DORM - MOLLY'S ROOM
 
              Molly sits on the windowpane, her forehead pressed against
              the glass.  Lurch, the dog, lies across her bed.
 
              ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDOW
 
              A view of the entire campus.  Couples make their way across
              the grounds, move inside the gymnasium.

              Molly lets out a sigh, wishes that were her and John... she
              continues to stare longingly out the window...
 
              THROUGH THE GLASS
 
              ON Wally as he moves to the bell tower, disappears inside.
              He is followed by...
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              ON Molly.  She sits up, takes notice... watches as the SHAPE
              moves inside the bell tower, then suddenly...
 
              A PAIR OF HANDS
 
              grabs Molly by the shoulders... spins her around, revealing...
 
              LINDA
 
              in full "Bride of Frankenstein" costume.
 
                                  LINDA
                        BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Shit, Linda!
 
                                  LINDA
                        You're so easy...
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Wasn't scaring the hell out of me
                        once today enough?!
 
                                  LINDA
                        Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win
                        scariest costume?
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Linda, you are without a doubt the
                        scariest person on campus.
 
                                  LINDA
                        Thanks!
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Where's Shane?
 
                                  LINDA
                        Condom Boy is waiting for me in
                        the cafeteria.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        But the dance is in the gymnasium.

                                  LINDA
                        Very insightful.
 
              THE BELL RINGS.
 
              Echoes across the campus.
 
                                  LINDA
                            (continuing)
                        Let the party begin.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Have enough fun for the both of us.
 
                                  LINDA
                        Oh, don't be such a victim.
 
              Linda produces a couple of shot bottles from her purse,
              tosses them on the bed.
 
                                  LINDA
                            (continuing)
                        Here.  Drink a couple of these.
                        It'll putcha in a much better
                        mood.  Ta-ta.
 
              Linda exits.  The bell continues to ring.  Molly sits on the
              bed, pats Lurch on the head.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Guess it's just you and me, boy.
 
              The bell stops ringing abruptly.  Molly turns her attention
              back to the window...
 
              ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDOW
 
              At the top of the bell tower... the SHAPE stands beside the
              massive bell... staring in Molly's direction, looking right
              through her.
 
              Molly gasps softly.  She looks down below and sees...
 
              LINDA
 
              leave the dormitory, heads for the cafeteria.  Molly looks
              back up to the bell tower... the SHAPE has vanished.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Just some idiot in a costume...
 
              Molly sits back on her bed, uses Lurch as a pillow... Molly
              picks up one of the shot bottles, twists off the lid.

                                  MOLLY
                            (continuing)
                        Let the party begin.
 
              Molly takes a swig from the bottle.  She shudders, her sour
              expression says it all...
 
              INT. CAFETERIA
 
              Dark and abandoned.  THE CAMERA PANS across a bevy of empty
              tables and chairs to reveal...
 
              LINDA AND SHANE
 
              liplocked, hands all over each other.  Linda sits on the edge
              of a table.
 
              Shane, dressed as a condom, stands between her legs.
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              watches from the kitchen, illuminated only by the light from
              a nearby soda machine.
 
              Shane pushes Linda down onto the table, starts to unbutton
              her blouse...
 
                                  LINDA
                        Wait.
 
                                  SHANE
                        What is it?
 
                                  LINDA
                        I have to pee.
 
                                  SHANE
                        Can't you hold it?
 
                                  LINDA
                        Can't you?
 
              Linda pushes Shane off her, heads for the restroom.  She
              passes the kitchen area... the SHAPE is nowhere in sight.
 
              Linda enters the bathroom...
 
              INT. BATHROOM
 
              Linda crosses to a shall, tugs on the door... it's locked.
              She knocks on the door.
 
                                  LINDA
                        Somebody in there?

              No answer.  She pulls at it again... still doesn't budge.
 
                                  LINDA
                            (continuing)
                        Hellooooo.
 
              She kneels down on the ground, peers under the door.  Nothing.
 
              She stands back up... shrugs it off... moves to the next
              stall and goes inside, closing the door behind her.
 
              TIGHT ON DOOR
 
              As Linda takes care of "business."
 
                                  LINDA (O.S.)
                            (singing)
                        IF YOU THINK I'M SEXY.
                        AND YOU WANT MY BODY.
                        COME ON, BABY.  LET ME KNOW.
 
              The toilet flushes.  Linda emerges from the stall, crosses to
              the mirror... checks her make-up.
 
              ANGLE ON THE MIRROR
 
              Linda admires her reflection... not noticing the stall door
              which was previously locked is now opened.
 
              She smiles at herself, licks her teeth, then exits to the
              hallway.
 
              INT. CAFETERIA
 
              Linda emerges from the bathroom... she heads toward the
              center of the room...
 
              ANGLE ON THE CAFETERIA
 
              Empty.  No sign of Shane anywhere.
 
                                  LINDA
                            (calling off)
                        Shane?
 
              CLANG!  A NOISE FROM THE KITCHEN.
 
              Linda moves into the kitchen area where...
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              emerges from the shadows, attacks Linda... grabs her by the
              throat, lifts her into the air...

              Her head hits the pot rack hanging above her... pots and pans
              drop to the tile floor below...
 
              Linda flails her arms and legs, desperately trying to free
              herself form the SHAPE'S grasp...
 
              She kicks the refrigerator door behind her... it swings open
              to reveal...
 
              SHANE'S BODY STUFFED INSIDE.
 
              Asphyxiated, his condom hat pulled down over his head... his
              corpse topples out of her refrigerator, falls onto the
              floor...
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              flicks the switch on a nearby MEAT SLICER, it WHIRS to life.
 
              The Shape forces Linda's head against the slicer... she
              struggles furiously as her cheek approaches the spinning
              blade...
 
              BLOOD SPLATTERS
 
              everywhere as Linda is carved into quarter-inch slices...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. HILLCREST ACADEMY - NIGHT
 
              VARIOUS SHOTS of the empty campus, all the students now
              congregated inside the gymnasium.
 
              The pulsating beat of faint dance MUSIC drifts across the
              grounds.
 
              INT. GYMNASIUM - SAME TIME
 
              The festival is in full swing... jam packed with costumed
              couples dancing across the floor.  CHAPERONES line the walls.
 
              KERI
 
              leans against the refreshment table, sans costume.  Arms
              folded... there in body, mind elsewhere.
 
              WILL
 
              approaches her, dressed as Count Dracula.  He offers Keri a
              glass of punch...

                                  WILL
                            (as Dracula)
                        May I offer you some fresh blood?
                        I squeezed it myself.
 
              Keri glances at him, not amused...
 
                                  KERI
                        Not a real fan of Halloween humor,
                        Will.
 
                                  WILL
                            (realizing)
                        Oh, right.  Sorry.
 
                                  KERI
                        I'm gonna head back to the
                        office... finish up some things.
 
                                  WILL
                        Can't it wait till Monday?  I
                        thought maybe we could dance...
                            (as Dracula)
                        I'm very light of my feet.
 
              Keri manages a sincere smile, gives him a kiss...
 
                                  KERI
                        Thanks, but I'm not much in the
                        mood for dancing.  Enjoy the
                        party... you did a great job.
 
              Keri heads for the exit, Will watches her leave...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. DORM - MOLLY'S ROOM
 
              CLOSE ON A HALF EMPTY SHOT BOTTLE
 
              on the bedside table, next to two other shot bottles...
              untouched.  CAMERA PANS to the bed where...
 
              MOLLY
 
              lies, fully clothed... facing the ceiling.  Eyes wide open,
              thinking of the night that could have been...
 
              ON Lurch, lying on the floor beside the bed... he sits up,
              his eyes focused on...

              THE CLOSET
 
              Its door slightly ajar...  the lights on inside.  Something
              inside catches Lurch's attention... he GROWLS.
 
              Molly reaches over the side of the bed, pats the dog on his
              head.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Whatcha growling at, huh?
 
              Lurch continues to snarl at the closet.  Molly sits up in the
              bed...
 
              ANGLE ON THE CLOSET
 
              Light seeps out from the cracks in the open door, illuminating
              the sleeves of several hanging blouses.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Lurch, there's nothing in there
                        but clothes.
 
              Molly gets up... moves to the closet, open it...
 
              INSIDE THE CLOSET
 
              Wall-to-wall clothes hang from wooden dowels... Molly palms
              the lightswitch, flicks off the light.
 
              Molly closes the door, tight... heads to the bathroom down
              the hall, Lurch follows her out.
 
              EXT. GYMNASIUM - SAME TIME
 
              The misfits who tee-pee'd the school have returned, this time
              with black duffel bags in tow.
 
              ON THE REAR DOUBLE DOORS
 
              of the gymnasium... one of the FRESHMEN pulls a thick three
              foot long CHAIN from his duffel bag... wraps it around the
              door handles... he produces a PADLOCK, hooks it through the
              loops of the chain... snaps it shut, locked tight.
 
              ON THE GYMNASIUM ENTRANCE
 
              Another freshman sneaks into the gymnasium, while a fellow
              SCHOOLMATE hide behind some bushes... on the lookout for
              Wally.
 
              INT. DORM - MOLLY'S ROOM
 
              Molly returns from the bathroom, passes...

              THE CLOSET DOOR.
 
              It's ajar once again.
 
              Molly climbs into bed, turns on her side... she reaches over
              to the side of the bed... pets the dog.
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Guess there's always next year...
                        if I live past the humiliation of
                        tonight.
 
              At that very moment, Molly sees...
 
              LURCH!
 
              The dog enters the room, sits in the doorway... growls in her
              direction.
 
              ON Molly.  Shit!  She instantly stops petting whatever is
              under the bed.
 
              CLOSE ON HER EYES
 
              full of confusion, flushes with fear.
 
              Terrified, she slowly leans over the edge of the bed... comes
              eye-to-eye with --
 
              THE SHAPE!
 
              Beneath her bed, staring right at her... she was petting the
              hair on his mask all along.
 
              Molly SCREAMS.  The SHAPE grabs her arm, drags her off the
              bed onto the floor.
 
              Molly struggles with him, as he tries to climb on top of her.
 
              The SHAPE maintains a strong grip on her ankle with one hand,
              swings a knife fiercely at her with the other.
 
              He makes contact, slices open her left thigh...
 
              Molly SCREAMS in agony, kicks her legs wildly... she manages
              to strike a hard blow to his head.
 
              She breaks free of his grip, takes off limping down the
              hall... her hand pressed against the gaping wound carved in
              her thigh.
 
              ANGLE ON THE HALL
 
              Seems to stretch for miles...

              Molly limps down the corridor, dragging her leg behind her...
              she looks behind her... no sign for the SHAPE... yet.
 
              She ducks into one of the room, hides behind the door.
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              emerges from her room... heads down the hall.
 
              ON Molly trying desperately not to breathe, she watches as...
 
              THE SHADOW OF THE SHAPE
 
              passes by... she lets out a silent sigh of relief, when
              suddenly...
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              steps back into the doorway, looks into the room.
 
              Molly freezes, looks at the wall beside her, she sees...
 
              HER OWN SHADOW
 
              projected on the wall, it betrays her.
 
                                  MOLLY
                            (squealing)
                        Oh, God...
 
              The SHAPE reaches through the crack in the hinged side of the
              door... grabs Molly by the hair, reels her in.
 
              Molly grabs the door... pulls it towards her, smashing the
              SHAPE'S arm between the door and the jam.  He releases her...
 
              She flies out of the room, down the hall... stumbles down a
              flight of stairs... dashes out of the dormitory.
 
              INT. GYMNASIUM - SAME TIME
 
              The party is in full swing.  Students and teachers alike
              crowd the gym floor, dancing to the music blaring from the
              loudspeakers above.
 
              CLOSE ON A SIGN
 
              "CAUTION: BE SURE TO CLEAR GYM AND/OR POOL
              BEFORE OPERATING FLOOR"
 
              Hung above a large red button.  THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO
              REVEAL the freshman, who snuck in earlier, poised beneath
              it...

              He punches the button, then pops it off and puts it in his
              pocket... he darts for the front entrance.
 
              CLANG-CLANG-CLANG!
 
              The gymnasium floor begins to move beneath the students'
              feet, splits right down the middle... retracts into the
              walls...
 
              The students part like the Red Sea, hooting and hollering as
              the pool beneath them is revealed.
 
              EXT. GYMNASIUM
 
              The freshman flies out of the gym, slams the doors shut
              behind him... his schoolmate chains the doors, locks them
              with a padlock.  They dart for the woods, passing...
 
              MOLLY
 
              stumbles towards them, her pants bloodied.  She SCREAMS,
              tries to get their attention... they disappear into the
              thicket.
 
              She moves to the rear of the gymnasium, bangs on the chained
              doors... SCREAMS for help, looks over her shoulder to see...
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              headed straight for her.  She hobbles to the front entrance,
              bangs on the door...
 
                                  MOLLY
                        Let me in!  Oh, God, help me!
                        Somebody... goddamnit!
 
              The SHAPE closes in.
 
              INT. GYMNASIUM - SAME TIME
 
              Molly's screams are lost amongst the gleeful SQUEALS of the
              party goers.
 
              The floor continues to glide open beneath their feet,
              revealing...
 
              SARAH
 
              floating, face down in the pool... water tainted bright red
              with her blood, illuminated by the pool light.
 
              The mood suddenly changes... the SCREAMS of excitement
              quickly turn into SHRIEKS of horror.  Bedlam ensues...

              Frightened students scramble toward the entrance, knocking
              party goers into the pool... trampling over others.
 
              AT THE ENTRANCE
 
              Students stack up against the doors, pounding furiously...
              trying to get out.
 
              WILL
 
              tries to calm the petrified party-goers...
 
              INT. HEADMASTER'S OFFICE - SAME TIME
 
              Keri sits behind her desk, Detective Blake's BUSINESS CARD in
              hand...
 
              She picks up the phone, brings it to her ear...
 
              NO DIAL TONE.
 
              She jiggles the receiver... STILL NOTHING.  She is distracted
              by --
 
              MOLLY'S SCREAMS
 
              from outside her office.  Keri crosses to the window...
 
              ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDOW
 
              Molly standing at the gymnasium entrance, pounding against
              the door with bloody palms... screaming bloody murder, trying
              desperately to get in, while the students on the other side
              try in vain to get out.
 
                                  KERI
                        Molly?
 
              The SHAPE approaches her, now only a few feet away.
 
              Molly tugs feverishly at the chains, they hold tight.  She
              bolts for the bell tower, trailing blood... the SHAPE follows.
 
              ON Keri, horrified... he's back.  She charges out of the
              office, on a mission...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. BELL TOWER
 
              Molly bursts through the door... she stops at the bottom of
              the staircase, looks up to see...

              FOUR FLIGHTS OF STAIRS
 
              spiraling high above her.  She hobbles up the stairway,
              grunting in agony...
 
              As she makes her ascent, she looks down to see...
 
              A SHADOW
 
              three flights down, begins its climb up the stairs.  Molly
              picks up the pace...
 
              EXT. BELL TOWER - CONTINUOUS
 
              Molly emerges at the top of the bell tower... runs over to
              the rope dangling from the massive bell... pulls with all her
              might, causes...
 
              THE BELL
 
              to swing... BUT there is no sound!
 
              Molly frantically pulls the rope again, SCREAMING madly...
              trying desperately to get someone's attention...
 
              Still no sound!  She moves to the gargantuan bell, looks
              inside and sees...
 
              WALLY'S BODY
 
              stuffed up inside of it, preventing the clapper from striking
              the bell.
 
              Molly reaches in, grabs Wally's shirt... tugs with all her
              might... expels the cadaver with a final heave-ho.
 
              ON Wally's corpse as it falls four stories down, lands at the
              foot of the staircase.
 
              Molly stumbles back... wraps the rope around her wrists, tugs
              with all her weight...
 
              RING-RING-RING!  THE BELL RESONATES ACROSS CAMPUS.  A call
              for help...
 
              Molly continues to pull at the rope, her wrists bleeding as
              the cord digs into her skin.  She watches in horror as...
 
              A SHADOW
 
              approaches the top of the stairway... a FIGURE emerges,
              it's...

              THE SHAPE
 
              Molly SCREAMS... the SHAPE grabs he... wraps the ROPE tightly
              around her neck... Molly grasp for breath.
 
              ON KERI
 
              Running furiously across the campus... trying desperately to
              reach the bell tower in time...
 
              ON THE SHAPE
 
              Moves Molly to the wall of the bell tower, tosses her over
              the edge....
 
              ON KERI
 
              Watches in horror as Molly falls two flights before the rope
              goes taunt, snapping her neck instantly... the bell CLANGS.
 
                                  KERI
                        NOOOOOOOOO!
 
              INT. GYMNASIUM - SAME TIME
 
              A group of STUDENTS, with Will at the helm, use a WOODEN
              BENCH as a battering ram...
 
              BOOM!
 
              The bench slams against the gym entrance, the metal doors
              start to buckle...
 
              BOOM!
 
              ON THE GYMNASIUM DOORS, the weight of the wooden bench pops
              the chains wrapped around the handles, the doors fly open...
 
              KERI
 
              watches as crazed STUDENTS pour out of the gymnasium, head
              for the parked buses across campus...
 
              STUDENTS spot Molly dangling from the bell tower... SCREAMS
              of terror echo across campus...
 
              Keri turns back to the bell tower... the SHAPE IS GONE!
 
                                  KERI
                            (realizing)
                        John...
 
              She heads toward --

              THE PARKED SCHOOL BUSES
 
              being filled to capacity with screaming teens...
 
              WILL
 
              leads the charge of getting all students safely aboard.
 
              KERI
 
              manages to find John amongst the throng...
 
                                  KERI
                        John!
 
              Mother and son reunite...
 
                                  JOHN
                        He found you, didn't he?
 
                                  KERI
                        Get on the bus.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Where's Molly?  She's not in her
                        room...
 
                                  KERI
                        Just get on the bus.
 
                                  JOHN
                        I'm not leaving without her.
 
                                  KERI
                        John, you can't help her now.
 
                                  JOHN
                        What?  Where is she?
 
                                  KERI
                        John...
 
              Keri's at a loss for words, it's written all over her face...
 
                                  JOHN
                        Oh, God... no... not Molly.
 
                                  KERI
                        Please, get on the bus...
 
              John hesitates for a beat... climbs into the bus, takes a
              window seat...

              WILL
 
              crosses to Keri, hugs her tight...
 
                                  WILL
                        Keri, you all right?
 
                                  KERI
                        We've got to get these kids out of
                        here...
 
                                  WILL
                        I'll make sure there's no kids
                        left in the dorms...
 
              WILL
 
              dashes toward the dorms...
 
              KERI
 
              climbs aboard the bus, stands next to the driver... waits
              impatiently for Will to return.
 
              EXT. HILLCREST ACADEMY
 
              The BUSES are on the move... leaving the academy single
              file...
 
              ON JOHN
 
              Watching from inside his bus as it prepares to leave...
 
              ON KERI
 
              Waves to John through the window, knows this may be the last
              time she ever sees him.
 
              She turns to the driver --
 
                                  KERI
                        You go ahead.  Will and I will
                        follow you in my car.
 
              The DRIVER nods in agreement...
 
              JOHN'S POV
 
              Keri gets off the bus, watches as the last bus drives through
              the open gates of the academy...
 
              Keri crosses to the dorms, disappears inside --

              INT. DORMS
 
              Keri moves noiselessly down the hallway... searching for any
              sign of Will... holding her breath with every door she checks
              behind...
 
                                  KERI
                            (a loud whisper)
                        Will... Will, where are you?
 
              Keri rounds a corner, spots --
 
              SMOKE
 
              seeping through the cracks of a swinging door leading to the
              dorm's kitchenette.
 
              KERI
 
              crosses to the swinging door, slowly pushes it open to
              reveal --
 
              WILL
 
              his whole upper torso shoved into the oven, clothes ablaze.
 
              KERI
 
              runs into the kitchen, yanks Will out of the oven by his legs.
 
              ON WILL.  Hair singed-off his head, his face a mangled mass
              of burning flesh, mouth agape in horror...
 
                                  KERI
                        Oh, God, Will...
 
              Keri kneels down beside him, helpless... filled with rage...
 
              SWOOSH!
 
              The kitchen door swings violently to and fro... Keri spins
              around, startled by --
 
              LURCH
 
              The dog jumps on her chest, licks her face gleefully.
 
                                  KERI
                        Get off me...
 
              The dog's mood changes suddenly: he stops licking Keri and
              GROWLS ferociously at something behind her...
 
              Keri slowly turns around to see --

              THE SHAPE
 
              standing above her, comes down on her with a knife... makes
              contact, slices her shoulder wide open.
 
              KERI
 
              scrambles to her feet, grabs a pot off the stove... swings at
              the SHAPE.
 
              CLANG!
 
              Delivers a hard blow to the SHAPE'S head with the iron pot.
              The SHAPE stumbles backward, Keri sprints out the door...
 
              EXT. DORMS
 
              Keri comes running from the building, dashes across campus
              and into --
 
              INT. HOUSE
 
              Keri bursts through the door, runs down the hallway into --
 
              INT. BEDROOM
 
              CLOSE ON: DETECTIVE BLAKE
 
              Her body sprawled across Keri's bed, THROAT SLIT from ear-to-
              ear... a TOMBSTONE in lieu of a headboard, "LAURIE STRODE"
              carved into stone.
 
                                  KERI
                        You son of a bitch!
 
              The fury wells inside of her.  Keri crosses to the bed, drops
              to her knees... pulls out the metal box underneath the

              EXT. HILLCREST ACADEMY
 
              Keri runs from the house, determined... makes her way across
              campus to --
 
              INT. GUARD HOUSE
 
              Keri crosses to the console, pushes the BUTTON that controls
              the gate... it begins to close slowly.

              CRASH!
 
              Hattie's body falls from the drop-ceiling above, lands right
              on top of Keri.  Shit.  Keri throws the bloody corpse off of
              her.
 
              She looks around the room... zeroes in on the large CB
              RADIO... she picks it up and SMASHES it against the
              console... over and over again... sparks fly... the gate now
              permanently closed.
 
              Keri reaches down, pulls Hattie's key ring from her body...
              moves outside.
 
              EXT. GATES
 
              Keri moves to the gate... locks it using Hattie's keys, then
              tosses them over the gate into the brush.
 
                                  KERI

                        Time to put an end to this
                        nightmare, motherfucker!
 
              Keri heads back toward the school.

              VARIOUS SHOTS of the empty campus.  Keri moves brazenly
              across school grounds, looking for the big brother....
 
              As she passes the bell tower, she sees --
 
              A SHADOW
 
              move inside the gymnasium... she quickly approaches --
 
              INT. GYMNASIUM
 
              Keri moves inside the decorated gym... stops at a
 
              FIRE AXE
 
              hanging behind glass... she picks up a plastic skull, smashes
              the glass with it... grabs the AXE and continues inside...
 
              CLICK!

              The lights go out... the gym now eerily illuminated only by
              carved pumpkins lit around its perimeter.
 
              Keri continues on, bravely... the fire axe tightly in her
              grip.
 
                                  KERI
                            (calling off)
                        Let's ends this right now.  You
                        want to kill me to fulfill your
                        twisted obsession, then go ahead.
                        I'm tired of playing hide-and-
                        seek, brother.  Come on, finish
                        what you started, you miserable
                        fuck.
 
              CLANG-CLANG-CLANG!
 
              Keri jumps... the gymnasium floor beneath her begins to move,
              closing back over the pool...
 
              Keri continues to move alongside the pool, when --
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              jumps from the bleachers, buries a knife deep into Keri's
              arm... she SCREAMS in pain... drops the fire axe into the
              pool.
 
              The Shape pulls the knife from Keri's arm, stands above
              her... he raises the knife high into the air, about to plunge
              it straight into Keri's heart, when --
 
              BANG! A BULLET BURROWS INTO THE SHAPE'S SHOULDER.
 
              Spins him around, comes face-to-face with...
 
              JOHN
 
              standing behind him, wielding Keri's SMITH AND WESSON.  The
              SHAPE moves toward him.
 
              BANG!  BANG!  BANG!
 
              JOHN empties the chamber into the Shape, thrust him
              backward...
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              falls into the pool, pulls Keri into the water with him...

              KERI
 
              struggles to climb out of the pool, the Shape fights to pull
              her back in....
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              finds the axe, swings at Keri... slice open her thigh.
 
              JOHN
 
              grabs Keri by the arms, manages to pull her out.
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              strives to climb out of the water as the gym floor continues
              to close... he swings the axe, buries the blade into the gym
              floor... grabs the handle, uses it to pull himself out...
 
              KERI
 
              grabs a JAVELIN hanging on the wall...
 
              THE SHAPE
 
              pulls his upper torso out of the water just as
 
              KERI
 
              raises the javelin high into the air, when --
 
              CLOSE ON: THE SHAPE
 
              Reaches out for her... then, a sound altogether unnatural --
 
                                  THE SHAPE
                            (a desperate plea)
                        Laurie...
 
              Time stands still -- TOTAL SILENCE.
 
              ON KERI.  All the love and loss of the past twenty years
              plays all over her face, when --
 
                                  KERI
                        Michael...
                            (then)
                        Go to hell!
 
              KERI
 
              plunges the javelin through his body with all her might,
              pierces his heart... the javelin juts out of his back.

              THE SHAPE
 
              arches his back in pain, grabs the metal rod... tries
              desperately to remove it, sinks into the water...
 
              THE GYM FLOOR
 
              closes above him... CLANG!
 
              Half the javelin sticks out above the floor... it twitches
              fiercely, then stops...
 
              CARTER
 
              storms the gym, gun drawn... followed by Deputy Clark and a
              dozen armed police officers.  He approaches Keri...
 
                                  KERI
                        Guess he was stoppable, after all.
 
              THE TERROR IS GONE.
 
              Keri and John embrace.

              POLICE CARS litter the campus.  The corpse of THE SHAPE lies
              covered on a gurney... a pair of PARAMEDICS roll it past --
 
              AN AMBULANCE
 
              parked near the entrance, its rear doors open revealing --
 
              JOHN
 
              being tended to by a PARAMEDIC.  Keri sits next to him...
 
                                  JOHN
                        I just can't believe she's dead.
 
              Keri does the only thing a mother can do, gives him a hug...
 
                                  KERI
                        I love you, John.
 
              Always the guy, John just shrugs, giving her a tough smile.
 
                                  JOHN
                        Yeah, me too, Keri.
 
                                  KERI
                        Call me Laurie, will ya?

                                  JOHN
                        Keri.... Laurie... how about if I
                        just call you Mom?
 
                                  KERI
                        That would work.
 
              The two embrace an another PARAMEDIC closes the rear doors of
              the ambulance, locking Keri and John safely inside.
 
              THROUGH THE REAR WINDOWS
 
              Mother and son continue to bond as the ambulance drives off
              into the night.

HALLOWEEN 6

THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS
DARKNESS fills the SCREEN.  SUPERIMPOSE:

October 30, 1995

DEAD SILENCE for what seems like an eternity, followed by a 
startling, bone-chilling SCREAM as we

FADE IN:

INT. DUNGEON - TUNNELS - NIGHT (DISTORTED)

The agonizing SCREAMS continue as we MOVE rapidly through a 
labyrinth of winding underground tunnels.  Glowing torches light 
the way.  Blurry, indistinct silhouettes of grim FIGURES wearing 
black-cowled robes flash along the dank, craggy walls.

As we BLAST around dark corners, we realize we are looking from 
the P.O.V. of a SCREAMING young woman being pushed forward on a 
gurney.  Plunging deeper into this hellish maze.

A door is SLAMMED.  Wooden.  Heavy.  Muffling the SCREAMS.

Spurs CLANK on a pair of silver-tipped cowboy boots as a 
MYSTERIOUS STRANGER steps into VIEW.  Long black duster.  
Widebrimmed fedora.  Lit cigarette dangling between gloved 
fingers.

INT. BIRTHING CHAMBER - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

A rat scampers from a hole, foraging in the muck of a rotted 
rack.  A white sheet, saturated with blood, covers the parted legs 
of JAMIE LLOYD, now 16, cheeks flushed with perspiration.
		
		JAMIE
	Oh, God, it's coming!  It's coming!

MARY, a young midwife, rushes in with a bowl of hot water.  Jamie 
lurches, knocking the bowl out of the girl's hands; it SHATTERS on 
the floor.
		
		JAMIE
	   (continuing)
	Mary, mother of God, please make it stop!

Mary's face is frozen in horror.  Jamie's SCREAMS build to an 
unnerving crescendo.  The paiin too much for her to bear.
			
			     FLASH CUT TO:

Lurid SHOCK CUTS from the previous "Halloween" entries -- a 
surrealistic blend of IMAGES and VOICES -- as Jamie relives her 
terrifying childhood ordeal:
		
		LOOMIS (V.O.)
	... Ten years ago he tried to kill Laurie 
	Strode ...

A)   LAURIE STRODE (Jamie Lee Curtis) twists and squirms as she is 
     strangled mercilessly in the hands of the murderous SHAPE.
		
		LOOMIS (V.O.)
	... Now he wants her daughter.

B)   Trapped in her bedroom, 10-YEAR-OLD JAMIE (Danielle Harris) 
     struggles to open the door.  She flings it open.  The Shape is 
     standing there, knife poised to kill!
		
		LOOMIS (V.O.)
	Michael Myers is here to kill that little girl 
	and anyone else who gets in his way!

C)   RACHEL (Ellie Cornell) dies in anguish as the Shape plunges a 
     pair of scissors through her chest.  TINA (Wendy Kaplan) dives 
     right into the path of the Shape's knife.  "Jamie, run!!!"

D)   Jamie sinks to her knees behind the fallen Shape, taking its 
     hand in her own.  CLOSE ON the Shape's hand.  Fingers flexing to 
     life.  A grotesque BRAND on its wrist -- an inverted isocsceles 
     triangle that will come to be known as the mark of THORN.

E)   BLINDING EXPLOSION rips through cinderblock.  A jail cell blown 
     to oblivion.  FIRESTORM rages.  The MYSTERIOUS STRANGER appears, 
     opening fire with a SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLE.

Pitiful wails of death.  OFFICERS writhing in pools of blood.  In 
the aftermath of this carnage stands YOUNG JAMIE.
			
			     FLASH CUT TO:

INT. CHAMBER - NIGHT (SAME)

Jamie struggles against her bonds.  Pushing.  SCREAMING.  Lapsing 
in and out of consciousness during the excruciating pangs of 
labor.  Haunted by low, moaning VOICES.  CHANTING.
			
			     FLASH CUT TO:

EXT. POLICE STATION - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT (NEW FOOTAGE)

RESUME Jamie, filled with repidation as she staggers through the 
smoke-filled cell into a darkened, drizzly alleyway.

JAMIE'S P.O.V.

Beyond the clearing wisps of smoke, THREE FIGURES wearing black 
ski masks usher THE SHAPE -- arms and legs shackled in heavy 
chains -- into the back of a white van.

BACK TO SCENE

Mutely terrified, Jamie backs away -- into the arms of another 
figure, obscured by smokescreen:  the Mysterious Stranger!

Jamie's scream is cut off as the Stranger descends upon her like 
the Angel of Death.

A cigarette arcs throug the darkness like a tiny flare.  Crushed 
under the boot of the Stranger.

A moment later, Jamie is shoved into the front seat of the van.  
Doors SLAM.  Tires SCREECH over wet pavement.

THE ENTIRE PRECINCT EXPLODES IN A HUGE CONFLAGRATION!
			
			     SHOCK CUT TO:

INT. CHAMBER - NIGHT

A SLAP and the first cry of the newborn BABY.  Jamie sobs 
uncontrollably, the straps preventing her from reaching him.
		
		JAMIE
	Please ... give him to me ...

The infant is wrapped in black swaddling.  The wooden door CREAKS 
open.  Jamie's eyes fill with horror as the shadow of the Stranger 
fills the room.  Standing at the threshold.  Waiting to receive 
the child.
		
		JAMIE
	   (continuing)
	No, please ... my baby!

The dark sentinels march out in somber procession, ignoring her 
desperate pleas.  Torches lighting the way.
		
		JAMIE
	   (continuing)
	Damn you!!  Damn you all to hell!!!

Jamie's heartrending SHRIEKS are cut off by the cold sound of the 
SLAMMING DOOR.
			
			     FADE TO BLACK.

MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE

A diaphanous column rises, a ghostly, slow-motion cylinder of 
flame that BURNS through the SCREEN to form the MAIN TITLE:
			
			HALLOWEEN 6

The OPENING CREDITS are BRANDED against the BLACK SCREEN by an 
invisible, kenetic force, interspersed with a SERIES OF CUTS:

Jamie's baby is lain upon a primitive altar.  Ringed by eleven 
stones engraved with cryptic markings.

Hooded, faceless figures.  Torches held aloft.  Disembodied 
VOICES.  Whispering.  Invoking a dark spell.

MARY, the young midwife, peers around a corner.  Eyes glazed with 
horror.  Watching.  Spying.

The newborn SCREAMS.  The flattened blade of a dagger smears a 
triangular symbol in blood over the baby's torso.

We MOVE IN on this symbol, capturing it in FREEZE FRAME.  It burns 
off into fiery cinders, disintegrating into DARKNESS.

Silence.  Then a startling CLAP OF THUNDER as we
			
			     SHOCK CUT TO:

A SIGN POST

standing askew in a matted patch of lawn.  WIND and RAIN.  INTENSE 
FLASH of LIGHTNING illuminates:

"For Sale By Strode Realty - SOLD"

EXT/INT. MYERS HOUSE - SUBJECTIVE P.O.V.

MOVE along a trail of drowning toys -- baseball, Power Rangers, a 
deck of Pogs -- TOWARD a weather-beaten porch.  Leftover gallons 
of Sears Best.  Brushes soaking in turpentine.  A dozen or so 2 x 
2s l;ined up to replace a row of broken railing slats.

P.O.V. LOOKS UP to the tall, brooding edifice.  Address reads:  45 
Lampkin Lane.  Fresh coat of white paint over old clapboard.  New 
shutters on the narrow windows.  A jack-o'-lantern grins behind 
filmy curtains.  The Myers house.

Despite its recent face-lift, it looks just as foreboding as it 
did in "Halloween I."

P.O.V. stalks down the side of the house, around to the back 
door.  Opens it and quietly MOVES inside.

P.O.V. MOVES across the darkened kitchen.  A drawer is opened.  
LIGHTNING reveals a large butcher knife being withdrawn.

P.O.V. glides past the living room -- a few boxes, furniture to be 
arranged -- and MOVES swiftly UP a long flight of stairs.

Down the long, dark hallway ... through a door.  A bedroom.  
P.O.V. FINDS 6-year-old DANNY STRODE ... tossing and turning in 
the throes of a nightmare.

An ear-splitting THUNDER CRASH causes the boy to bolt upright in 
bed, looking right into the P.O.V.  Sweating.  Shaking.  
Petrified.

DANNY'S P.O.V.

The THUNDER seems to ROAR from the ferocious jaws of T-REX -- a 
24" scale model posing on a shelf among an army of Jurassic 
monsters.  Seemingly brought to life by the ELECTRICAL STORM.

FOLLOW DANNY

as he leaps out of bed and pads across polished wooden floors into 
the hallway.  LIGHTNING FLASHES.  With the next THUNDER CRASH 
comes a startling, barely intelligible VOICE.
		
		WHISPERING VOICE (O.S.)
	Danny ...

Danny freezes.  Slowly turns.

DANNY'S POV

An ominous shadow at the end of the hall, illuminated by 
LIGHTNING.  Long duster and brimmed hat.  The Stranger!  In his 
outstretched hand, the gleaming butcher knife!
		
		WHISPERING VOICE (O.S.)
	Kill for him!

BACK TO SCENE

Danny screams!  THUNDER CRASHES HELLISHLY.  Lights flash on.  
Doors fly open.  Suddenly Danny is swept up in the protective arms 
of his mother, KARA, 22.
		
		KARA
	Danny!

The little boy holds onto her for dear life.  Crying 
hysterically.  Eyes clenched tightly.
		
		KARA
	   (continuing)
	Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
		
		DANNY
	The voice man!  He's here!

Kara looks in the direction he's pointing.  In the light there's 
just an antique coat rack -- "dressed" in a hat, rain jacket and 
old silver-tipped umbrella.
		
		KARA
	Danny, no one's there.

Danny dares to look -- but now only cries harder.

Kara carries Danny back to his room, averting the steely-eyed gaze 
of her father, JOHN STRODE, staunch, late 40s, wearing boxer 
shorts and a well-worn undershirt.
		
		JOHN
	Some of us have to get some sleep around 
	here.  What's with that kid?

Kara ignores him as her mother, DEBRA, careworn face with 
compassionate eyes, tries to lend a hand.
		
		DEBRA
	Let me take him for you, Kara.
		
		KARA
	It's all right, Mom.  Go back to bed.

Debra sighs resignedly.  TIM, 18, stocky and streetwise, wearing 
torn red sweat pants and "Ice-T" t-shirt, casually replaces his 
Walkman headphones and returns to his room.

INT. DANNY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (A FEW MINUTES LATER)

Kara opens the closet and switches on the light.  Satisfying Danny 
that it's empty, she breaks into her perfunctory routine.
		
		KARA
	Stay away monters, stay away ghouls. Stay away 
	from Danny.  You jerks know the rules. 
	   (crossing to Danny's bed)
	Better?

Danny giggles as his pretty young mother tucks him in.
		
		DANNY
	Mommy, when can we go home?

Kara sighs.  They've been through this one before.
		
		KARA
	Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new 
	house.  At least while I'm in college.  
	Remember our deal.
		
		DANNY
	The kids at school said this is a haunted 
	house -- that a bad man used to live here.
		
		KARA
	They did, did they?  Since when did we start 
	listening to the kids at school?
		
		DANNY
	But I've seen him!
		
		KARA
	You've been watching too much TV.
		
		DANNY
	He says things.  Bad things.
		
		KARA
	Like what?

Danny is afraid to tell her.
		
		KARA
	   (continuing)
	If you mean the things Grandpa says sometimes, 
	ignore him.  Once he gets to know you he'll 
	come around ... Let the bad things you hear 
	slide right off your back.

Kara tousles his blond hair and kisses his forehead.  Then she 
goes to the closet, just about to turn out the light --
		
		DANNY
	   (sitting up; panicked)
	No, Mom -- keep it on!
		
		KARA
	Okay ... But just for tonight.

Kara adjusts the closet door, causing one of Danny's school 
drawings to fly off the wall.  She picks it up on her way out.
		
		KARA
	   (continuing)
	Good-night, Danny.

Kara softly closes the door.  Danny lies awake, blankets drawn up 
to his chin, eyes wide.  Still very much afraid.

INT. KARA'S ROOM (CONTINUOUS)

Kara yawns, removes her glasses and rubs her eyes, setting Danny's 
drawing on a pile of open books.  Cliffs Notes and Diet Coke 
cans.  Telltale signs of a late-night cram session.

Adjusting the dial on her FM/alarm clock, Kara begins to move 
about the little room, slipping out of her clothes as the 
subtly-seductive voice of a WOMAN comes over the radio:
		
		WOMAN (V.O.)
	I know this sounds crazy, Harry, but I love 
	him.  I write to him every week. I think I 
	even want to have his child --

The woman is cut off by the nasally, steel-trap voice of HARRY 
SIMMS, talk radio's most popular man of controversy:
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Let me get this straight, Debi.  Now you're 
	saying that not only does this guy get you 
	sexually aroused, but now you want to bear his 
	offspring?!

Wearing only her bra and panties, Kara moves to a full-length 
mirror and lets down her long, flaxen hair.  Beneath her studious 
exterior, she is quite attractive:  delicate features with an 
enviable, naturally-toned figure.
		
		WOMAN (V.O.)
	Deep down, he's just like you and me. He just 
	needs someone to understand him.  Someone to 
	love him.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	You're talking about one of this nation's most 
	notorious serial killers like he belongs in 
	some kind of Est seminar!  What planet have 
	you been on, lady?  Michael Myers has been 
	dead for six years!

A CLICK as the woman is abruptly DISCONNECTED.

Kara suddenly whirls around, startled by a FLASH of something -- a 
face -- in the mirror!

Drawn to the window behind her, she rubs off rainy mist and peers 
outside.

KARA'S P.O.V.

of the large Victorian frame house directly across the street.  
Another FLASH OF LIGHTNING reveals the shadow of a man standing in 
the uppermost window -- looking right at her!

ANGLE ON KARA

Frightened, her eyes lock on Danny's drawing.  A child's 
scribbling in red Crayon:  The triangular symbol of Thorn!

EXT. MYERS HOUSE / BLANKENSHIP HOUSE

Kara draws the priscilla curtains over the window as we PULL BACK 
through the pouring RAIN ... toward the house across the street.  
An ornate sign on the front door reads:

"Blankenship House - Rooms Available"

CRANE UP toward the window where the shadowy figure stands.  An 
insidious CRASH OF THUNDER as we PUSH through the window.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

A macabre display of old newspaper headlines, arranged 
helterskelter on a wall:  "HALLOWEEN KILLS ESCAPES FROM ASYLUM."  
"HORROR IN HADDONFIELD:  MICHAEL MYERS CLAIMS 16 LIVES."  "REIGN 
OF TERROR ENDS AS MYERS PERISHES IN VIGILANTE EXPLOSION."

Harry Simms BOOMS over a state-of-the-art HiFi system.  A cassette 
tape RECORDS the continuing broadcast.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Now we've got someone who claims he's actually 
	seen Michael Myers.  Does this whacko caller 
	have a name?

Staring out the window at the Myers house, TOMMY DOYLE, a 
strapping 25-year-old with reddish brown hair and intense eyes, 
cradles a cordless phone.
		
		TOMMY
	My name's Tommy.  I was only eight- years-old 
	when I saw him.  But I was lucky.  I survived.

Tommy paces nervously around his sparsely-furnished attic 
apartment.  Classic horror movie one-sheets and mint first edition 
comic books share wall space with a chilling array of guns, 
knives, and survivalist weapons.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Sounds like you're a candidate for 
	electroshock therapy, Tommy.  Don't tell me 
	after all this time you still believe Myers is 
	alive?!

Tommy pauses, mesmerized by one of the newspaper clippings.
		
		TOMMY
	Michael's work isn't finished in Haddonfield.  
	Now it's just a matter of time before he comes 
	home to kill again.  But this time I'll be 
	ready.

MOVE IN TIGHT on the headline, frail and yellowed by age:  
"November 1, 1978.  TOMMY DOYLE SURVIVES BABYSITTER BLOODBATH."  
Directly beneath this:  "November 3, 1989.  JAMIE LLOYD FEARED 
DEAD IN POLICE STATION MASSACRE."

CLOSE ON a photograph of young Jamie and
			
			     SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DUNGEON - CHAMBER - NIGHT

Jamie remains strapped to the table, wrapped in bloody sheets.  
Eyes closed.  Deathly still.  Suddenly an urgent, WHISPERING VOICE 
pierces the darkness:
		
		WHISPERING VOICE (O.S.)
	Jamie?  Jamie?!

Jamie startles awake to see the midwife frantically releasing her 
straps.
		
		MARY
	Come with me if you want to save your baby.

Jamie can't believe her eyes.  Mary opens a threadbare knapsack -- 
revealing the baby inside!

A soul-shuddering RUMBLE echoes throughout the cavern.  Jamie 
leaps up, eyes wide with fear, sensing the evil presence.
		
		JAMIE
	Oh, God ... He's coming!
		
		MARY
	We've got to move.  Now!

Pulsing with adrenaline, Jamie harnesses the knapsack over her 
shoulders and follows Mary out into the tunnels.

TUNNEL GATE

Chains GRIND over rusted pulleys.  A massive iron gate rises, 
revealing a pair of filthy work boots.  Legs planted in bold 
stance as a tall, ominous shape begins to emerge.

ANOTHER TUNNEL

The terrified midwife leads Jamie with her baby on a breathless 
flight through the winding network of tunnels.  Haunted by the 
ECHOING SOUNDS of the rising gate.

STALKING P.O.V. - THROUGH TUNNELS

Gliding forward into the hollow catacombs.  Slow by determined.  
Sensing the way.

ANOTHER PART OF THE TUNNELS

Reaching a corner, Mary stops and sends Jamie off in the opposite 
direction.
		
		MARY
	There!  It's that way!
		
		JAMIE
	No --
		
		MARY
	Save your baby -- go now!

Jamie runs, disappearing down the dark tunnel.  Mary quickly 
removes her shoes and tears off, now SILENT.

STALKING P.O.V.

surges around a corner.  FINDS Mary.  MOVES IN on her.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Mary turns in small circles.  Fear mounting as she falters into 
darkness.  Heavy, labored BREATHING fills the tunnel.

A mask -- the pale, neutral features of a man weirdly distorted by 
the rubber -- materialized out of the void right behind her.  THE 
SHAPE!

Mary turns, about to scream when the Shape lunges out, lifts her 
up by the nape of the neck and SLAMS her forehead into a large 
metal SPIKE jutting out from the cavern wall!

Leaving her impaled like a fish on a hook, the Shape resumes its 
relentless pursuit.  Eerie under the lighted torches.

END OF TUNNEL

Jamie runs frantically.  Methodical, heavy FOOTSTEPS behind her.  
She chances a look behind.  The Shape is coming!

Jamie vaults up a dark stairwell.  A trap door above.  It won't 
budge.  Jamie frantically POUNDS against the hatch.

The Shape mounts the stairs!

Strength fueled by sheer desperation, Jamie forces the door open.  
Tumbles onto muddy ground.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Jamie drags herself out of the hole and half-runs, half-stumbles 
with her baby through an ugly, charred forest.  Sharp branches 
whip at her face.  RAIN falls.  LIGHTNING streaks across the sky.

As if hell-spawned, the Shape emerges from the underground chamber 
and trudges forward, bold and unstoppable.

Jamie tumbles into a gully, nearly dropping the knapsack.  She 
picks herself up, hands groping at rain-sopped earth.  The Shape 
is right behind her!

INT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT (SAME)

A slap-happy, overweight MOTORIST sips coffee from a 7-11 cup, 
straining to see the road through falling rain and fogged-up 
glasses.  Harry Simms keeps him mindlessly occupied.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Next up is Dwayne.  What's on your feeble 
	excuse for a mind, "Dwayne?"

The Motorisft lets out a hardy GUFFAW, spilling his coffee.
		
		MOTORIST
	Shit!

Fingers burning, he searches the glove compartment for a napkin.
		
		DWAYNE (V.O.)
	I'd just like to say that I listen to your 
	show every night, Harry.  I think you're the 
	best.  I can't tell you how excited we are 
	that you'll be paying a visit to our little 
	town tomorrow night.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Do you have a point to make here, Dwayne, or 
	should I just keep practicing my wrist 
	exercises?
		
		DWAYNE
	   (chortles)
	Harry, you're too much.  I'd just like to say 
	that I understand how things have changed in 
	the 90's.  Gays in the military, cut off your 
	husband's do- jigger, become a national hero.  
	But I just can't see any sense in bringing 
	Halloween back to Haddonfield.

The Motorist looks up.  Eyes go wide with panic.  Startled GASP.

P.O.V. THROUGH WINDSHIELD

Jamie stands in the middle of the road, SCREAMING bloody-murder.

EXT. WOODED ROAD / INT. PICKUP TRUCK (SAME)

Tires SCREECH.  The pickup stops on a dime.  The Motorist just 
sits there, mouth agape as the shrieking girl throws open the door 
and clambers into the passenger seat.
		
		JAMIE
	Drive!  Goddamnit, drive!

Through his side-view mirror, the unsuspecting Motorist sees the 
outline of a quickly-approaching man.  Unrolling his window, he 
rubbernecks a look outside.
		
		MOTORIST
	Hey, what do you think you're --

CRUNCHING BONE and TEARING FLESH as the Shape's hands shoot 
through the window, twisting the man's head off his shoulders!

Jamie SCREAMS!  Lunges for the steering wheel.  Slams her foot 
down hard on the gas.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The pickup bullets forward, fishtailing up the road, never slowing 
down as the driver's door flies open, dumping the motorists's 
headless bulk into a muddy ditch.

INT. PICKUP (SAME)

Jamie drives.  Checks to see that her baby is safe.  Then lets out 
a PRIMAL SCREAM.  A hysterical release of fear and rage, drowned 
out by the squabble of VOICES over the radio:
		
		MALE CALLER #2 (V.O.)
	You're coming here for this Halloween fair -- 
	it's all just a game -- a publicity stunt for 
	you, isn't it Harry?  These kids -- they're 
	not old enough to remember what Myers did 
	here. They look up to you.  Now you're just 
	asking for trouble.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	You people really get me.  What are they 
	putting in the water in that town?
			
			     CUT TO:

INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME)

LIGHTNING FLASHES and RAIN pelts the windows of a bucolic cabin.  
This is a man's retreat and has been for years.  Dark wood, worn 
leather, a few tastefully-chosen antiques.  Floor-to-floor ceiling 
shelves containing a myriad of books and an impressive display of 
awards and degrees, all bearing the name:  SAMUEL J. LOOMIS, Ph.D.

After a STATION IDENTIFICATION, "The Harry Simms Show" resumes, 
tinny-voiced CALLERS blaring over a handsomely-restored 1928 
Bremer-Tully.
		
		MALE CALLER #3 (V.O.)
	All these fanatics aside, Harry, I'd 
	personally like to thank whoever did the 
	masked one in.  Saved us tax-payers a lot of 
	money in the long run.
		
		FEMALE CALLER #3 (V.O.)
	Yeah, that sucker's been dead for six years.  
	It's about time they had a Halloween revival 
	in this town.  Now my kids can stop driving me 
	crazy!

MOVE IN behind a bald, sharp-featured man, hunched over a can as 
he reminisces over a collection of framed photographs -- memories 
of his wife and children.
		
		MALE CALLER #4 (V.O.)
	What happened to that psychiatrist of his?  
	Loomis, I think was his name.  I heard the old 
	quack was dead.

Turning at the mention of his name is DR. LOOMIS himself, wearing 
spectacles, a comfortable sweater and his trademark goatee.  For 
the first time ever, we actually see him smile.  The burn scars on 
his face have all but faded away.  Last traces of the horrid past.
		
		LOOMIS
	Not dead.  Just very much retired.

Loomis hobbles to the desk and finishes cutting out a newspaper 
article.  As he arranges the strips of paper in a leather-bound 
scrapbook, a sudden KNOCK at the door gives him a startle.

EXT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME)

An ominous FIGURE, clad in hat and trench coat, stands beneath the 
glowing porch light, silhouetted in the pouring RAIN.

Loomis opens the door, eyes straining in the semi-darkness, trying 
to identify his unexpected visitor.
		
		LOOMIS
	   (sudden recognition)
	What the devil?!  Come in -- come in!

INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Shuffling inside, dripping with rain, DR. TERENCE WYNN, a 
well-dressed gentleman in his 50s, removes his hat and coat, 
quickly making himself at home by the crackling fire.
		
		WYNN
	Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a 
	sign for five miles on that road!
		
		LOOMIS
	That's the whole idea of living in the 
	country.  I thrive on the seclusion.

Wynn heads for the kitchen, rummaging through cabinets and drawers 
as Loomis dutifully wipes up his muddy trail.
		
		WYNN (O.S.)
	Don't tell me that the reviled Rasputin of 
	Smith's Grove has grown complacent in his 
	golden years.  I don't buy it for a single 
	second, Dr. Loomis.

Loomis immediately senses that Wynn has an angle.
		
		LOOMIS
	And in all these years, I've never known you 
	to make house calls, Dr. Wynn.  Especially at 
	this hour ...

Wynn returns with a bottle of Irish whiskey and two shot glasses.  
Thrusts one in Loomis's hand and begins to pour.
		
		WYNN
	Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not 
	to second-guess the motives of my fellow man.  
	Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar 
	is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink 
	is just a drink.
		
		LOOMIS
	I hope you didn't come all the way out here in 
	this storm just to quote Freud.
		
		WYNN
	As always, your keen powers of perception 
	astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to 
	celebrate. 
	   (raising his glass)
	After thirty-two years as Psychiatric 
	Administrator, guess who has been named 
	Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
		
		LOOMIS
	But surely Rogers isn't --
		
		WYNN
	Retiring.

Loomis is abruptly stunned and delighted by the news.
		
		LOOMIS
	Why -- congratulations!  I can think of no one 
	better suited for the position.

The two old sparring partners drink to the occasion.  But Wynn's 
angle soon comes to the helm.
		
		WYNN
	Of course, I need a new Administrator. Someone 
	who can bring new life -- and some old blood, 
	if you'll pardon the expression -- back to our 
	program ...

Loomis prepares himself for the bomb.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	We need you, Dr. Loomis.
		
		LOOMIS
	You should know that it's not wise to play 
	Halloween pranks on me.
		
		WYNN
	You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things 
	haven't been the same since you left.  I'm 
	recruiting the best psychiatric team in the 
	country.  Old colleagues.  This is your change 
	to finally make a difference.

Loomis scratches his head and settles down into his comfortable 
easy chair, amused at the irony of Wynn's speech.
		
		LOOMIS
	Even after my stroke six years ago they 
	practically had to hold a gun to my head to 
	get me to retire.  Now things have changed.  
	I've changed.  The ghosts have been buried.  
	Why on earth would I want to dig them up 
	again?

Loomis finally looks over at Wynn, surprised to find him standing 
at the desk, looking through his scrap book.
		
		WYNN
	Seems to me there's at least one ghost that's 
	still lurking in your closet.

We follow Wynn's gaze down toward the open page.  A blazing 
tabloid headline:  "MICHAEL MYERS - DEAD OR ALIVE?"
			
			     SHOCK CUT TO:

EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Jamie's getaway truck ROARS around a bend, tearing up a deserted 
stretch of highway.  The STORM rages.

INT. PICKUP (CONTINUOUS)

Jamie strains to see as she drives through sheets of RAIN.  Bone 
weary, fighting panic, holding one hand steady against the wheel, 
the other on the CRYING infant.
		
		JAMIE
	God ... Help us, please ...

Something up ahead.  Jamie's face fills with expectancy.

JAMIE'S P.O.V. - THROUGH WINDSHIELD

A lighted sign appears out of the darkness.  Glowing salvation.  
Familiar red-white-and-blue logo.  "GREYHOUND."

EXT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT

The pickup drives into the glow of orange vapor lights.  SKIDS to 
a stop in a deserted parking lot.  Jamie staggers out, cradling 
the knapsack as she runs toward the old depot.

INT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT

Jamie blasts through double glass doors.  But the bus station is 
devoid of life.  Empty benches.  Blank ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE 
signboard.  The low hum of vending machines.

Jamie moves toward the ticket counter.  A handwritten sign left by 
the attendant:  "BACK IN 20."

Shivering, holding her baby, Jamie enters an old-fashioned phone 
booth.  Picks up the receiver and immediately dials 911.
		
		VOICE (V.O.)
	You have reached Haddonfield Emergency 
	Services.  Due to severe weather conditions, 
	all circuits are momentarily busy.  If this is 
	not an emergency, please dial directly ...

Jamie slams the phone down in terrified frustration.  Suddenly she 
becomes aware of the radio program.  Piped in over ancient 
loudspeakers:

		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	For anyone who gives a flying circus, this is 
	Harry Simms -- the light in your night, the 
	love of your loins -- and I want to hear from 
	more of you bogeyman believers out there.  So 
	give me your best shot at 1-800-878-7274. 
	That's 1-800-URTRASH!

The STATION IDENTIFICATION cuts in.  Jamie picks up the receiver and 
frantically dials the number.

INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME)

Wynn doesn't give up the sales pitch even as Loomis leads him to the 
door.  The radio program still squawking in the b.g.
		
		WYNN
	But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, 
	you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.
		
		LOOMIS
	Please try to understand, Terence. I've already 
	made up my mind.

As Wynn continues to talk, his voice trailing off into nothingness, 
Loomis's attention is diverted to the VOICES on the radio.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	So they're trying to kill you and your baby.  
	Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be 
	Rosemary.
		
		JAMIE (V.O.)
	   (intense whisper)
	No -- please listen!  They're coming ... coming 
	for me and my baby.

Loomis's eyes widen; a man possessed.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's 
	coming?
		
		JAMIE (V.O.)
	It's ... Michael ... 
	   (releasing)
	... Michael Myers!

Loomis staggers.  A lifetime of nightmares coming back to haunt him 
all at once.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME)

PRESS IN TIGHT ON TOMMY in bed.  Listening through headphones.  
Sitting upright.  Thunderstruck.
		
		JAMIE (V.O.)
	Somebody help me!  Dr. Loomis, are you out 
	there?  Can you hear me?

INT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME)

Wynn watches with rapt attention as Loomis unlocks his safe and 
withdraws a metal case.  He pops it open, revealing his trusted .357 
Magnum and a box of cartridges.

INT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT (SAME)

A bus has arrived.  The ATTENDANT returns to his post.  Jamie hangs 
up the phone, filled with trepidation as PASSENGERS file inside.  A 
strung-out ROCKER.  A pair of stern-faced NUNS.  A PRETTY TEENAGER 
greeted in the loving arms of her BOYFRIEND.

Just as she is about to step out of the phone booth, a TALL MAN, 
back turned, wearing a hat and black trench coat, moves to stand 
outside the booth!  Jamie freezes.

Securing her baby in the knapsack, Jamie throws open the door.  
Suddenly the Tall Man steps in her path!
		
		TALL MAN
	Are you all right, young lady?

Shaking uncontrollably, Jamie shrinks away.  Backing down a narrow 
hall through the door marked "LADIES ROOM."

INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT (SAME)

Water runs into a grimy basin.  Unable to contain her tears, she 
washes the newborn.  Takes a roll of paper towels and tries to rub 
the triangular blood mark off his chest.

Suddenly the lights go out.  Jamie gasps.  Clutching her baby, she 
turns off the faucet and melts into the darkness.

The door CREAKS open.  FOOTSTEPS echo inside.

JAMIE

has locked herself inside one of the stalls.  Heart pounding.  The 
FOOTSTEPS grow louder.  Jamie's eyes dart frantically.

STALKING P.O.V.

MOVING methodically past the row of stalls, pushing open each door, 
revealing that they are all empty.  A CRASH from the last stall.  
P.O.V. moves toward it.  RUSTLING and MOVEMENT inside.

A HAND pushes on the door.  An open window above the toilet.  Jamie 
is gone!

EXT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Jamie trembles off a stack of crates piled beneath the window and 
dashes around the side of the depot.

Suddenly the bus ROARS by, sending up a muddy wave as it pulls out, 
disappearing down the highway.

Jamie moves swiftly across the parking lot, clutching the knapsack.  
She throws open the door of the pickup and jumps into the driver's 
seat.

INT. PICKUP - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Slapping down the locks, Jamie thrusts the key into the ignition.  
The engine REVS to life.  She guns it, peeling out of the parking 
lot.  Back toward the highway.

She drives on, suppressing her tears, stealing glances at the 
knapsack bunched up on the passenger's seat.  Then she turns and 
looks forward with concentrated attention.

JAMIE'S P.O.V.

A sign looms ahead:  "Haddonfield Memorial Hospital - 10 Mi."

BACK TO SCENE

Jamie sighs with relief, steadying the wheel just as --

HIGHBEAMS flash on right behind her, a juggernaut roaring out of 
blackness!  Jamie's eyes flood with terror.

JAMIE'S P.O.V. - THROUGH WINDSHIELD

The grill of a familiar white van shoots forward, SLAMMING violently 
against the pickup's rear bumper.

JAMIE

is jolted forward in her seat.  Holding on the wheel with a 
white-knuckle grip as she's repeatedly hit from behind.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The unseen madman noses forward, veering sharply over the double 
yellow line, scraping sides with the truck.

Headlights sear a path through the night, locked in neck-and-neck 
profile.  SPARKS flashing at 70-miles-per-hour.

The van forces Jamie onto the shoulder.  It leaves the road, tearing 
branches from trees.  Jamie SCREAMING.

EXT. PUMPKIN PATCH - THE CHASE

A quick-cut MONTAGE, events ticking out in fractions of a second 
like a nightmare:

The pickup springboards over a gulch and slams down hard, tires 
spinning in waves of mud, careening through a vast field.  A 
pumpking patch.

The van reappears in a glare of headlights.  Its engine screaming 
with fire-breathing rage.

The pickup puts on a furious burst of speed.  Eating up pumpkins and 
spinning out chunks of splattering seeds and pulp.

The van bears down hard, slingshotting across the field, whizzing 
past the pickup, cutting right in front of it.

INT. PICKUP

Something heavy is thrown from the back of the van right through the 
windshield!

Glass EXPLODES!  Jamie SCREAMS, hands going up instinctively to 
protect her face.  Swerving wildly out of control.

She looks to see a sprawling, mutilated corpse on top of her.  Wide, 
cold, lifeless eyes -- Mary!
		
		JAMIE
	No!!!

EXT. PUMPKIN PATCH (CONTINUOUS)

The pickup rockets at breakneck speed toward the edge of the field.  
Suddenly --

JAMIE'S P.O.V.

The Shape stands in the field, tall and unmoving, white mask glowing 
hideously in the rush of oncoming headlights.

BACK TO SCENE

The truck plows into the Shape, dragging it under, SLAMMING headlong 
into the trunk of a huge oak tree.

Everything is abruptly and shockingly silent.  Like a phantom in the 
night, the van is gone.  The Shape nowhere to be seen.

Steam billows from the pickup, engine TICKING, a heap of shattered 
glass and mangled steel.  Pinned against the base of the tree is a 
shape in human form -- a scarecrow!

MOVE IN on Jamie, face-down against the steering wheel.  Coughing on 
the noxious fumes, she stirs back to life.  Slowly, painfully, she 
shoulders the door.  Falls onto the ground.

A SPARK ignites.  BLINDING FLASH as the gas tank EXPLODES, setting 
the truck ablaze.  Jamie turns, her face a frozen rictus of horror.  
Debris rains down on her.

Suddenly a grim shadow rises from the field.  The Shape -- wielding 
an enormous butcher knife!

Jamie rolls onto her back, SCREAMING.
		
		JAMIE
	No -- NO!!!

Suddenly the knife plunges down and lands with a terrible THUD.

INT. PICKUP

The knapsack catches fire ... but inside there is no baby.  Only a 
roll of paper towels from the bus depot.

THE SCARECROW

burns; mocking Jamie with its grinning, hand-painted face.
			
			     SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

THE SHAPE

looks at us, white mask scintillating against blinding rays of 
SUNLIGHT.  Rivulets of blood drip off a large carving knife.

PULLING BACK, we see it is a life-sized, knife-wielding effigy of 
Michael Myers, sitting astride the "For Sale by Strode Realty" 
sign.  Stage blood spells out the words:  "He's coming!"

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

John Strode looks up with disgust as he inspects the grim monument 
that's been left on his front lawn during the night.  Puffing on a 
cigarette, wearing slippers and a flimsy bath robe, John raises a 
large axe.

A group of neighborhood KIDS -- some dressed in Halloween 
costumes -- stand a safe distance away.  Gathered on the sidewalk.  
Gawking, whispering, tittering.

John angrily swings the axe into the signpost.  The kids jump with a 
collective start.
		
		JOHN
	Enough ... 
	   (one CHOP)
	... of this ... 
	   (two CHOPS)
	... Michael Myers ... 
	   (timber)
	... shit!

Suddenly the sign crashes down -- and "Michael Myers" with it.  The 
kids huddle.  John turns on them, brandishing the axe.
		
		JOHN
	   (continuing)
	You stinkin' kids got three seconds to get the 
	hell off my property!  One, two --

That's all it takes.  The kids scatter, tripping over one another as 
they tear off down the black.

Satisfied with himself, John stubs out his cigarette and hauls the 
sign and its now-headless rider to the trash.

Then he trudges up the porch steps, dropping the axe as he enters 
the house.  Uttering oaths under his breath.

BOOM UP over the surrounding neighborheed.  SUPERIMPOSE:

"Haddonfield, Illinois.  Halloween."

Last night's storm has given way to an incredibly bright and 
picturesque morning.  CHILDREN pour out of their homes, bursting 
with excitement, dressed in colorful costumes.

Even the Myers house, with its trimmed hedges and fresh coat of 
paint, somehow manages to look invite.

A white van slowly rolls up the street.  WKNB logo, streamers and a 
large orange banner proclaiming:  "HADDONFIELD JUNIOR COLLEGE 
HARVEST FAIRE '95 - See Harry Simms Live - October 31."  A 
now-familiar voice booms over loudspeaker:
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	This is Hard Harry Simms harping on ya from the 
	Big Apple.  Tonight's the night and the place 
	to be is the First Annual Harvest Faire.  So 
	come on out of your broom closets, 'Fielders, 
	and bogey the night away with me.
		
		MALE CALLER #4 (V.O.)
	Harry, I just won first prize for ugliest 
	costume!  Guess who I'm dressed as.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Your mother?
		
		MALE CALLER #4 (V.O.)
	No, man -- You!!!

EXT. SANITARIUM - MORNING

A car bearing an official state emblem stops outside an imposing 
curtain of security gates.  A large sign reads:  "SMITH'S GROVE - 
WARREN COUNTY SANITARIUM."

A hand reaches out and waves a plastic key card in front of an 
infrared scanner.  Surveillance cameras perched on the walls.

As the gate yawns open and the car drives through, we SEE the asylum 
in the distance -- the entire perimeter bounded by woods and barbed 
wire fences.

INT. WYNN'S CAR (CONTINUOUS)

Wynn drives.  Loomis in the passenger seat, fueling his own 
anxieties.
		
		LOOMIS
	It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was 
	Jamie.  Calling for me.
		
		WYNN
	You don't know that for sure.  It could have 
	been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
		
		LOOMIS
	It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew 
	she would one day.  And whatever has brought 
	her back has brought Michael back as well.
		
		WYNN
	After six years?  Sam, she died with him in 
	that explosion after the --
		
		LOOMIS
	That's what someone wants us to believe, but I 
	tell you Michael is alive.  I feel him.  I 
	sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did 
	all those years as I watched him.  Sitting 
	behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing 
	stronger. 
	   (off Wynn's silence)
	As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't 
	go through this again.  Not alone.  I need your 
	help to stop him.

Wynn stares.  Loomis's words fall on him like a death sentence.

INT. SANITARIUM - RECEPTION AREA (SAME)

Gold insignia on mahogany doors:  "TERENCE WYNN - CHIEF OF STAFF."

Wynn and Loomis stride through a plush reception area.  DAWN, an 
attractive, high-energy secretary, keeps pace, taking notes, handing 
Wynn his briefcase, phone messages, etc.
		
		WYNN
	Cancel all my appointments.  Get Dr. Loomis 
	anything he needs -- files, tests, records of 
	every treatment ever administered to a former 
	patient of ours -- Michael Myers.
		
		DAWN
	   (stunned)
	Michael Myers?

Wynn stops abruptly before heading out the door.
		
		WYNN
	That's right.  We think there's a very good 
	chance he might still be alive.

Loomis acknowledges Wynn's silent understanding.

CORRIDOR

Wynn and Loomis move along a sterile white corridor.  Wynn uses his 
key card to BUZZ them through a series of metal security cages.  A 
retinue of DOCTORS and NURSES fall in behind.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on 
	our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We 
	go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours. 
	   (beat)
	If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
		
		LOOMIS
	Or what's left of him.

They cut down a sub-passageway and out a fire exit.

EXT. SANITARIUM - LANDING FIELD (CONTINUOUS)

Loomis and Wynn dash across a windswept field where a Smith's Grove 
medical transport helicopter awaits them.  The deafening WHINE of 
spinning rotors as a TECHNICIAN refuels.

The doctors step inside.  The doors close and the helicopter lifts 
off, rising high above the cluster of the white coats below.
			
			     CUT TO:

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

A blender whips up a revolting concoction of chocolate Yoo-Hoo, 
banana yogurt and chewy Gummi-worms as Tim, wearing Levi's baggies 
and a "Harry Simms Kicks Ass" T-shirt, raps on the phone.
		
		TIM
	Bro', I knew Harry when we lived in the city.  
	Don't worry -- he'll be there. We've got 
	everything arranged.  Get with me tonight at 
	the fair and I'll hook you up.  Peace.

Tim hangs up, guzzling down his shake as Debra navigates around him, 
setting out the breakfast dishes as Kara tries to study.

John, dressed in what might be a respectable business suit if it fit 
him better, mutters grumpily as he pours himself a cup of coffee.
		
		JOHN
	Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed 
	them ...
		
		DEBRA
	Relax, John.  They were just kids.
		
		JOHN
	Kids are what's ruining this country. 
	Everywhere you go, it's the same.  No goddamn 
	respect.

Tim lets out a huge BELCH as he finishes drinking his breakfast.
		
		JOHN
	   (continuing)
	See what I'm talkin' about?
		
		DEBRA
	You'll never pass that exam on an empty 
	stomach, Kara.

Debra snatches the book out of Kara's hands.
		
		DEBRA
	   (continuing; reading)
	Cognitive Therapy and Emotional Disorders?  
	What are they teaching in college these days?  
	The art of going crazy?
		
		KARA
	   (indignant)
	It's called psychology, Mom.  Living in this 
	house is what's driving me crazy.
		
		JOHN
	Who the hell told you to come live here in the 
	first place?

Kara rises, collects her books, trying to avoid a confrontation.
		
		KARA
	I'd better get Danny to school.
		
		JOHN
	She don't show her face for five years, then 
	expects us to roll out the red carpet.  You 
	think going to college is gonna make up for 
	your mistakes, girl?
		
		DEBRA
	John, please don't --
		
		TIM
	Yo', just lay off her, Dad.

Suddenly Danny runs in, showing off in his dinosaur costume.  
ROARING loudly.  Startling John.
		
		JOHN
	What the fuck --

Kara immediately seizes Danny's hand and ushers him toward the back 
door.
		
		KARA
	Let's go, Danny.
		
		DEBRA
	Kara, wait.  John.  Can't we all just sit 
	down?  Try to be a family for once?
		
		KARA
	I'm sorry, Mom.

Debra reaches into her purse and hands Kara a couple of dollars.
		
		JOHN
	That's it, Debra, keep slipping her the cash.  
	While you're at it, why don't you just give her 
	all our goddamn money?!

John explodes, dumping the entire contents of her purse onto the 
floor.  Debra recoils.  Kara steps in.  Danny is terrified.
		
		KARA
	Stay away from her, you bastard.
		
		JOHN
	   (re Danny)
	I only see one bastard in this house.

Kara flies at him with Medea-like rage.  John instantly grabs her by 
the neck and shoves her violently against the counter.
		
		TIM
	Dad!  Let her go!
		
		DEBRA
	John!  Stop it!  Stop it!

Danny looks outside.  Frozen in horror.  A VOICE whispers.
		
		WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)
	Kill him, Danny ... Kill him ...

Danny moves across the kitchen.  Mesmerized.  Through the screen 
door, the Shape can be seen standing in the back yard.

Kara's eyes bulge as John squeezes her throat.  Choking her.
		
		JOHN
	You ever raise your hand to me again, I'll kill 
	you, you understand?

John looks down to see the tip of a butcher knife pointed at his 
groin.  Danny is holding it -- his eyes dark, emotionless.  Ever so 
slowly, John releases Kara.  Debra and Tim watch in horrified 
astonishment.

Suddenly there's a KNOCK at the back door.  Kara dives toward 
Danny.  The knife clatters to the floor as she picks him up, grabs 
her book bag and hurtles outside.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - BACK YARD (CONTINUOUS)

BETH, 19, very "retro," cute in the waifish sense -- milky white 
skin, two-tone hair and a dangling nose ring --is nearly bowled off 
the back porch as Kara and Danny fly out the door.
		
		BETH
	Make way for the Hardin County Express. 
	   (following them across the yard)
	Hey, where's Tim?  We're supposed to go over 
	the list of events for tonight --

Beth is taken aback when she sees the bruise on Kara's neck.
		
		BETH
	   (continuing)
	He do that to you?
		
		KARA
	Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the 
	Strode house.
		
		BETH
	Pig.  What the hell happened this time?

Suddenly Tim jumps out from behind a clothesline, locking his arms 
around Beth, attacking her with kisses.
		
		BETH
	   (continuing)
	Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
		
		TIM
	Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to 
	organnize this friggin' fair? It's only 
	Halloween.

Beth shoves the clipboard at him, a champion of her cause.
		
		BETH
	How many times o I have to tell you? It's not 
	about Halloween.  It's about being political.  
	There are too many people with corn-cobs up 
	their ass in this town telling us what we can 
	and can't do.  If we want change, it's up to us 
	to set an example.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN (SAME)

Debra is on the floor, stifling her tears, putting things back in 
her purse.  John stares coldly out the window.
		
		JOHN
	I want her and that kid out of here tonight.

Debra rises, facing him scornfully.
		
		DEBRA
	I thought inheriting your father's house ... 
	the business ... moving out here might change 
	things.  But you're still the same, John. 
	   (with finality)
	Kara has come home, and I'll be damned if I let 
	you turn her away again.

Debra storms off.  John bores holes into her with his eyes.

EXT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE (SAME)

Tim lifts Danny into the back seat of Beth's convertible VW Bug -- 
plastered with "Greenpeace" and "This is Your Brain on Drugs" bumper 
stickers.  Kara and Beth in front.
		
		TIM
	Whatever happened to women in back?
		
		BETH
	Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.

Pulling away from the curb, Beth honks at MRS. BLANKENSHIP, at least 
80, owner of the student boarding house across the street.
		
		BETH
	   (continuing)
	See you tonight, Mrs. Blankenship!

The old woman just stares forward.  A gardem hose in hand as she 
waters a garden of long-dead flowers.

Kara shields her eyes, distracted, looking up at the old Victorian 
house.

KARA'S P.O.V.

Beth drives down a shady, tree-lined avenue, unaware of the white 
van that is following them.
		
		KARA
	Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall 
	from you?
		
		BETH
	Why?  You interested?
		
		KARA
	No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window.  
	Watching me.
		
		BETH
	You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale 
	he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary 
	shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed 
	up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably 
	just lonely.

Tim leans forward, ravaging Beth's neck.
		
		TIM
	Or horny.
		
		KARA
	Tim, do you always have to act like such an 
	asshole?
		
		TIM
	Only when you're around to dump on ... Hey, 
	chill, sis.  I'm just doggin' ya.

Suddenly the van ROARS by and cuts them off.  Beth lays on the 
HORN.  Slams on the brakes.  Narrowly avoiding a collision.
		
		BETH
	Speed kills, asshole!

Suddenly the van swerves around to face the VW head on.  For a 
breathless moment the van and the VW sit at opposite ends of the 
intersection.  Idling.  A tense stand-off.
		
		KARA
	Who is that ...

Kara strains to get a look at the van's driver.  A momentary glimpse 
of a pale white face behind the wheel.
		
		BETH
	   (bravely)
	I've got my pepper spray.

Danny sits frozen in the back seat.  Suddenly the van shoots 
forward, tires SCREAMING.  Startled GASPS.  The van turns off 
sharply at the last second, SCREECHING down the next block.
		
		TIM
	   (relieved)
	Happy fuckin' Halloween.
		
		BETH
	Someone's trying to scare us out of having this 
	fair ... and it's not gonna work.

Beth drives on, grimly determined.  Kara looks back at Danny.  He 
returns her frightened gaze.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Tommy paces in his cramped apartment.  Dark circles under his eyes.  
A remote control in hand, reviewing his recording of last night's 
Harry Simms broadcast:
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	So they're trying to kill you and your baby.  
	Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be 
	Rosemary.
		
		JAMIE (V.O.)
	No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming 
	for me and my baby.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's 
	coming?
		
		JAMIE (V.O.)
	It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!

Frustrated, Tommy plays it again.  Adjusts the speed.  Tries to make 
out something else in the b.g.  Jamie's voice comes through.  Slow.  
Eerie.
		
		JAMIE (V.O.)
	   (continuing; slowed)
	It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!

Another VOICE, distant and distorted, filters up behind hers.
		
		ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
	Bus 611 from Russellville now arriving.

Tommy quickly stops the tape, throws on his worn leather bomber 
jacket and bolts straight out the door.

MOVE IN on a pair of old newspaper clippings left on the floor.  
Headlines read:  "November 5, 1989.  JAMIE LLOYD STILL MISSING."  
"November 19, 1989.  MYERS' NIECE PRESUMED DEAD."
			
			     DISSOLVE TO:

INT. FORD EXPLORER / EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - MORNING

Tommy drives like a bat out of hell.  The "Greyhound" sign looms 
ahead.

EXT. BUS DEPOT - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

The Explorer pulls up to the depot.  Tommy makes a beeline for the 
entrance, cowboy boots splashing through rain puddles.

INT. BUS DEPOT (CONTINUOUS)

Tommy wades his way through a small crowd up to the ticket booth.  A 
cross-eyed ATTENDANT greets him.
		
		ATTENDANT
	Can I help you, sir?
		
		TOMMY
	Can you tell me if a bus arrived from 
	Russellville last night?

The Attendant checks her roster.
		
		ATTENDANT
	Sure did.  About seven hours ago.  You lookin' 
	for someone --
		
		TOMMY
	   (walking away)
	Thank you.

The Attendant eyes Tommy suspiciously as he enters the phone booth 
in the corner.  Inside, he picks up the receiver and pretends to 
dial a number.  Makes a cursory inspection.

TOMMY'S P.O.V. - PHONE BOOTH

On the floor, tiny droplets of what appear to be blood form a dotted 
trail out the door.

TOMMY

follows the crimson path around the corner down a dim hallway, 
stopping at the door marked "Ladies Room."  Checking first to make 
sure the coast is clear, he steps furtively inside.

INT. LADIES' ROOM (CONTINUOUS)

Tommy walks past the sink.  Water drips into the filthy basin.  He 
touches something inside, rubs it on his fingers -- blood.

Tommy whirls, startled by a sudden NOISE.  Muffled, indistinct.  
Like CRYING.  Tommy gathers his courage as he slowly moves past the 
long row of empty stalls.  The CRIES grow louder as he reaches the 
final stall.  Jamie's escape route -- the window -- still wide open.

A hole in the wall behind the toilet.  Tommy reaches in, his hands 
locking onto something.  Shock and amazement overcome him when he 
lifts out a baby -- Jamie's baby.
		
		TOMMY
	Jesus ...

The helpless newborn kicks and CRIES, the triangular symbol of Thorn 
still caked in blood over his tiny torso.

SUBJECTIVE P.O.V.

Someone partially opens the door, peering in from the hallway as 
Tommy removes his jacket and bundles the baby inside.
		
		TOMMY
	Okay, little guy.  You're okay.

BACK TO SCENE

A CREAK.  Tommy looks up.  The door slowly closes.

DEPOT HALLWAY

Tommy looks into shadowy stillness.  No one there.  Hiding the baby, 
cradling his jacket, he hurries through the crowd and slinks out the 
door marked ENTRANCE.
			
			     SHOCK CUT TO:

HELICOPTER P.O.V.

The SOUND of THWACKING BLADES as we FLY past a winding rural highway 
over a dense grove of oak trees -- massive, ancient guardians of the 
sprawling pumpkin patch that lies beyond.

As we circle the field, red-and-blue gum machines -- police cars, 
fire engines and ambulances -- can be seen through gauzy veils of 
rising BLACK SMOKE, dissipating with the strong WIND.

Charred in the ground, three intersecting lines stretch a hundred 
feet across the plan to form a vivid geoglyphic.  The symbol of 
Thorn.
		
		HELICOPTER PILOT (V.O.)
	   (filtered)
	Chopper One to Smith's Grove.  We've got a 
	visual.  Approximately ten miles due east of 
	Haddonfield.

INT. HELICOPTER (CONTINUOUS)

Loomis surveys the crash site with morbid fascination.  Wynn, 
wearing headphones, shouts over the noise.
		
		WYNN
	   (pointing)
	What is that?
		
		LOOMIS
	It's a sign.  He's come home.

EXT. PUMPKIN PATCH - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

The helicopter lands, windmilling gusts of ashen earth.  Loomis and 
Wynn jump out, ducking past the spinning blades.

We FOLLOW them through EMERGENCY CREWS and a few CURIOSITY-SEEKERS 
toward the center of attention.  A charred body is lifted from the 
eviscerated, flame-blackened pikcup truck.

A few feet away, a team of PARAMEDICS work frantically around 
another body, hidden among a cluster of pumpkins.

Loomis surges forward, at once halted by an armed DEPUTY.

		DEPUTY
	Sir, you'll have to step back.
		
		LOOMIS
	Please.  I need to see the sheriff.
		
		WYNN
	Official business.

Wynn flashes his badge.  The Deputy gives them a vexed glance.
		
		DEPUTY
	Wait here.

Loomis's eyes flicker with nervous anticipation.  The Deputy 
whispers something to SHERIFF JIM HOLDT, a brooding giant of a man 
who dons a Stetson, holstered .44 Special and steel-toed boots that 
give new meaning to the term "bad ass."

Even Loomis steps back as the sheriff lumbers toward them.
		
		LOOMIS
	   (extends his hand)
	You must be Sheriff Holdt.

Holdt responds by stubbing out his Marlboro at Loomis's foot.
		
		HOLDT
	As a matter of fact, I am.  And I take it 
	you're the infamous Dr. Loomis.
		
		LOOMIS
	I'd like to introduce you to Terence Wynn, the 
	Chief of Staff at --
		
		HOLDT
	Smith's Grove.  They told me you'd be coming.  
	Now I suggest you fly right on back to your 
	crackpot asylum.  You people got no business in 
	my town.
		
		LOOMIS
	Michael Myers is my business.

Holdt towers above him.
		
		HOLDT
	I want you to listen and listen good, Loomis.  
	Things have been quiet for six years and that's 
	the way they're gonna stay.  The last thing we 
	need is you spouting off your ghost stories.

As usual, Loomis isn't easily intimidated.
		
		LOOMIS
	I suppose it was a ghost that did all this.  A 
	ghost who called the radio station last night.  
	Maybe that same ghost is lying over there right 
	now.

Holdt fumes, ready to boil when --
		
		DEPUTY
	Sheriff!  She's alive!

Holdt and Loomis wade through the crush of paramedics, running 
alongside the stretcher being whisked toward an ambulance.

A large knife extruding from a girl's stomach, packed under sterile 
gauze.  Skin pasty-white.  Lips blue from shock.
		
		LOOMIS
	Dear God ... Jamie!
			
			     CUT TO:

EXT. HADDONFIELD JUNIOR COLLEGE - PARKING LOT - MORNING

Beth's car pulls into the parking lot of a picturesque, impeccably 
landscaped campus, speckled with colorful leaves.  A buzz of 
excitement fills the autumn air.

Tim and Beth are surprised to see a small crowd -- camped out in 
sleeping bags, holding "We Love to Hate Harry" signs.
		
		TIM
	Yo, check it out.  They've been lining up all 
	night just to see Harry. 
	   (to Kara)
	You lose your mind in that thing, Kara?

Kara is nervously rifling through her enormous book bag.
		
		KARA
	I can't find my term paper.
		
		TIM
	So copy someone else's.  I do it all the time.  
	Works primo.

Armed with her clipboard, Beth is assailed by her COMMITTEE.  
Inundating her with QUESTIONS.
		
		BETH
	Give us victory or give us death.  See you 
	tonight, Kara!

Tim and Beth are swept away.  A large sheet of paper falls out of 
Kara's bag.  She picks it up, startled by what she sees.

KARA'S P.O.V. - THE DRAWING

Crayola figures of Grandma, Grandpa, Uncle Tim, and Mommy.  Knives 
piercing them.  Blood dripping.  Mouths screaming.  A black shadow 
figure bearing the word "THORN."

On the flip side, the drawing she found last night.  Danny's 
scribbling of the odd triangular symbol.

BACK TO SCENE

The horrifying images send chills up Kara's spine.
		
		KARA
	Thorn ...

Lost in grim reverie, Kara walks on, oblivious to the activity all 
around her ...

A banner hangs from the eaves of the library:  "HADDONFIELD JR. 
COLLEGE - FIRST ANNUAL HARVEST FAIRE."

Tim and Beth supervise as preparations for tonight's event get 
underway.

STUDENT VOLUNTEERS nailing together booths, hanging decorations.  A 
half-assembled Ferris wheel, a merry-go-round, an ominous-looking 
House of Horrors.

Rounding the corner onto the quiet path behind the library, Kara 
suddenly finds herself alone.  WIND whips at her hair.  She glances 
over her shoulder, as if sensing a presence.

KARA'S P.O.V.

No one is there.  Just the rustling of leaves on the ground.

ANGLE ON KARA

Walking off in the distance.  Suddenly the Shape steps shockingly 
into FRAME, watching her disappear around the corner.
			
			     SHOCK CUT TO:

INT. HADDONFIELD MEMORIAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

Doors BLAST open.  The stretcher holding Jamie is pushed through, 
Loomis right beside her.  Wynn follows, trying to stop him.  A 
SHOCK-TRAUMA unit swarms in.  No time to lose.
		
		PARAMEDIC
	Penetrating abdominal trauma.  Massive blood 
	loss.  We've given her two units of O-negative 
	stat and dextran.  BP sixty.  Pulse one-twenty 
	... Somehow she pulled through out there all

DR. BONHAM, the ER resident, peels off the sheet, exposing a dark 
sea of blood around the enormous knife still jutting from Jamie's 
stomach.  Bonham stares, incredulous.
		
		DR. BONHAM
	How can this girl still be alive?! Type and 
	cross-match for another six units!  Get a CT 
	scan and move her into surgery.

	And get them out of here!

ORDERLIES move in.  Loomis won't release Jamie's hand.

	Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
		
		LOOMIS
	I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live.  
	You have to.

HOSPITAL ENTRANCE / ADMITTANCE DESK

Pneumatic doors fly open.  Tommy bursts through, holding the baby in 
his jacket.  PATIENTS and COPS everywhere.  He hones in on the NURSE 
behind the admittance desk.
		
		TOMMY
	I need to see a doctor.
		
		NURSE
	What seems to be the problem?
		
		TOMMY
	I-it's a baby -- my baby.  There's been -- been 
	an accident.
		
		NURSE
	What kind of an accident?
		
		TOMMY
	   (explodes)
	Just get me a doctor right now!

ADJACENT HALLWAY

Wynn and Loomis skirt past a line of SECURITY GUARDS.
		
		WYNN
	There's nothing more you can do for her.

The shrill sound of Wynn's beeper.  He clicks it.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	I'll be right back.

Wynn disappears around the corner.  Loomis wanders off alone.
		
		TOMMY (O.S.)
	Dr. Loomis!

Loomis reacts, taken aback by the frantic young man bounding toward 
him.
		
		LOOMIS
	Yes?
		
		TOMMY
	Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard 
	her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
		
		LOOMIS
	I'm sorry, but do I know you --
		
		TOMMY
	I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode -- 
	Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me 
	that night --

Loomis suddenly recognizes him.  It's been a very long time.
		
		LOOMIS
	Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
		
		TOMMY
	Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael 
	Myers come home?

Loomis pulls Tommy aside into an empty alcove.
		
		LOOMIS
	What do you know about Michael?
		
		TOMMY
	I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they 
	want us to believe he's dead.  But I know.  
	I've always known.
		
		LOOMIS
	Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie 
	Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She 
	is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
		
		TOMMY
	   (gravely)
	No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.

Tommy hesitates.  Loomis's eyes are drawn enigmatically to the 
infant in Tommy's arms.
		
		TOMMY
	   (continuing; startled realization)
	Oh, God -- his cousins.  The Strodes. They're 
	living in the Myers house!

Loomis's face flls with horror.  Tommy sees the Admittance Nurse, 
flanked by a pair of security guards, walking his way.
		
		TOMMY
	   (continuing)
	I gotta go.

Tommy bolts toward the exit.  Loomis tries to stop him.
		
		LOOMIS
	Tommy, wait!

But he is gone.  A hand taps Loomis's shoulder; he reels.  Wynn.

	There you are.  Who was that boy?

	An old friend.

Darkness fills Loomis's countenance as we

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - DAY

We peer OVER THE SHOULDER of the Shape, standing across the street.  
Watching Debra, in jeans and a rumpled sweatshirt, collecting 
left-over painting supplies from the front porch.

Debra starts to open the CREAKY screen door when she notices the axe 
John had used earlier.  Clumsily picks it up and slides it through 
the top of the crate she is holding.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - FOYER (CONTINUOUS)

Laden with her heavy load, Debra nudges the door shut with her 
foot.  Then crosses to another door -- the cellar door.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

Debra, silhouetted at the top of the stairs, hits a light switch; a 
naked bulb springs to life.  Slowly she descends the rickety 
staircase.

The basement, pitch dark save for a spear of sunlight shooting 
through an elevated window, is overrun with cobwebs, rusted tools 
and broken bicycle parts.  A clunker of a washing machine RATTLES in 
the corner.

Debra makes space for the crate in a storage cabinet.  Suddenly the 
washing machine stops.  Nonplissed, she moves toward it.  Lifts the 
lid.  The bed sheets inside are sopping wet.

Opening the electrical fuse box, she flicks a switch back and forth 
a few times -- but the washing machine doesn't respond.
		
		DEBRA
	Great.

Frustrated, Debra looks down to see a large puddle of water forming 
on the floor.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - FOYER (SAME)

Debra hauls a laundry basket upstairs, filled with wet sheets.  She 
turns, startled.  The front door is standing wide open.

Just as she goes to shut it, a man steps out from the living room 
behind her.  She gasps, dropping the basket; it's Loomis.
		
		LOOMIS
	I'm very sorry, Mrs. Strode.

Debra shudders at the sight of the beguiling, wide-eyed man.
		
		LOOMIS
	   (continuing)
	I've been knocking.  The door was open. Is 
	everything all right in here?
		
		DEBRA
	   (defensively)
	Who are you?

	I've come to help your family.

Debra steps aside as Loomis walks in right past her.  Holding a 
valuminous file bearing the name "MICHAEL AUDREY MYERS."

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - DAY

The SOUND of JANGLING KEYS.  A door UNLOCKING.  Tommy scrambles in, 
the baby iin one arm, a bag of groceries under the other.

With a single swipe, he clears away the junk on his futin, then 
carefully lays down the CRYING infant.  He digs through the bag:  
Baby Wipes.  Diapers.  Formula.  Bottles.
		
		TOMMY
	Shhh.  Okay, okay, Kyle.  You like that name?  
	Yeah, I think it suits you.

Quickly he scans the directions on the formula.  Pours the liquid 
into a bottle, nukes it in the microwave, then returns to the 
business at hand.

Tommy grimaces at the mess inside his leather bomber.  The baby 
CRIES harder.
		
		TOMMY

	 This is worse for me than it is for you.

Armed with Baby Wipe and a diaper, Tommy goes to work.

UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (SAME)

Tommy finishes securing the diaper.  The baby in his arms, he tests 
the formula's temperature and feeds him.  The infant sucks

The other kids make way as Danny takes the empty spot on the

Ian goes berserk, leaping out at Danny like an enraged lion.  The

Kara waves at Beth in the distance, making last-minute

A ducking for apples booth.  Homebaked goodies set out on picnic

carving contest.

The centerpiece of all this is a huge, magnificently decorated 
HALLOWEEN TREE.  Tim and a gaggle of WORKERS stream up ladders, 
stringing lights, hoisting up colorful bunting filled with mounds of

A large group of PROTESTORS carry PICKET SIGNS in front of the

with HAREM GIRLS and a large golden throne.  The side door opens.  A 
red carpet is rolled out.

A tall, imposing figure emerges from the van and walks up the 
steps.  Spurs CLANKING on black boots.  "Jesse James" style duster.  
Hat cocked slightly.
		
		HARRY SIMMS (V.O.)
	Hellllo, Haddonfield!!!

The crowd turns in a mass of confusion.  Standing above them, waving 
from a microphone, is HARRY.  Dark sunglasses.  Gaunt, glacial 
features and an outrageous mane of black hair.

Suddenly Harry throws open his duster -- flashing them -- revealing 
that he has nothing on beneath except his boots and a pair of bright 
orange boxer shorts that say "HAPPY HALLOWEEN."

The kids go insane.

ANGLE ON LOOMIS

Making his way through the teeming crowd.  Walkie-talkie in hand.  
The helicopter zooms overhead.  Wynn's voice squawks over garbled 
RADIO CHATTER.  Conducting a surveillance by air.
		
		WYNN (V.O.)
	   (filtered)
	There's more people moving eastbound down Old 
	Reservoir Road past the elementary school.
		
		LOOMIS
	   (into walkie-talkie)
	Any word on the location of the Strodes?
		
		WYNN (V.O.)
	No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
		
		LOOMIS
	Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on 
	that house.

Suddenly Loomis is waylaid by a giant wall of a man -- Sheriff 
Holdt.  Loomis meets his fiery gaze.
		
		HOLDT
	I'm warning you, Loomis -- stay out of my way.  
	You may have had free reign when Ben Meeker was 
	sheriff, God rest his soul, but I'm in charge 
	now.  And I'm not about to stand by and watch 
	you turn this night into some kind of sadistic 
	witch hunt.
		
		WYNN (V.O.)
	Sam, I just got word from the hospital. You'd 
	better get over there right away.
		
		LOOMIS
	   (into walkie-talkie)
	What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
		
		WYNN (V.O.)
	I'll meet you over there.

Loomis tears off.  Holdt stares brazenly, throwing down his 
cigarette.  Crushes it under his boot and slowly follows him.

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - LOBBY - NIGHT

Carrying the CRYING baby, Tommy leads Kara and Danny into the lobby 
of the vintage boarding home.  Polished wood.  Framed old 
paintings.  Wall-to-wall Tiffany lamps.

Mrs. Blankenship sits behind the front desk, oblivious to the 
GRINDING and SCREAMING on the television as "The Texas Chain Saw 
Massacre" reaches its horrific climax on the annual Horrorthon.
		
		TOMMY
	Quiet around here tonight, huh, Mrs. B.?

As usual, the senile old woman doesn't reply.
		
		KARA
	   (indignantly; to Tommy)
	Do you mind telling me what this is all about?  
	Tim and Beth are waiting for us.

Tommy ushers Kara and Danny up the stairs.  Mrs. Blankenship stares 
at the boy -- the kind of stare that would send most kids running 
for their moms.  But Danny is undaunted.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT (CONTINUOUS)

The door opens.  Kara is repulsed by the sight of Tommy's musty, 
unkempt apartment.
		
		DANNY
	Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
		
		KARA
	   (to Tommy)
	You can't expect us to stay here --

Tommy adjusts the blinds on the window looking out on the Myers 
house.
		
		TOMMY
	I want you to watch your house.  You can see 
	everything from this window.

Kara glares, reminded of last night.
		
		KARA
	Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I 
	supposed to be looking for?
		
		TOMMY
	Him.

Tommy flashes a newspaper article in front of her.  One we've seen 
eariler:  "MICHAEL MYERS - DEAD OF ALIVE?"

The baby's SCREAMS are verging on overload.  Tommy dashes to the 
recessed kitchen area and heats up another bottle.

As Kara reads, Danny tugs at his mother's blouse.
		
		DANNY
	Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun 
	stuff!
		
		KARA
	   (snapping)
	Danny, you're just going to have to wait!

Danny plods off.  Kara hands Tommy a nipple for the bottle.  Their 
eyes lock for a beat.  He takes it.
		
		TOMMY
	Shhh.  It's okay, Kyle.  Just give me one 
	more -- 
	   (the microwave BEEPS)
	-- second.  There you go, big guy.

Kara looks on as Tommy attempts to feed the baby.  Despite his 
clumsiness, she's undeniably moved.

Behind them, Danny's imagination kicks into high gear as he drives a 
Power Ranger over an invisible race track.  On the floor.  Across 
the windowsill.  Glancing across the street.

DANNY'S P.O.V. - THE MYERS HOUSE

Standing below on the front lawn is the Shape, silhouetted under a 
moonlit tree.  Looking right at Danny.

BACK TO SCENE

Danny backs away, terrified.  Tommy and Kara are too concerned with 
the baby to notice.
		
		TOMMY
	God, what's wrong with him?
		
		KARA
	Here.  Let me try.

Tommy gingerly hands the baby over to her.  Instantaneously, Kyle's 
CRIES subside.
		
		KARA
	   (continuing; fawning)
	There.  All it takes is a mother's touch.

For one fleeting moment, Tommy and Kara find themselves smiling at 
one another.  Unaware as Danny glides silently out the door.  
Tommy's expression darkens once again.  A man possessed.
		
		TOMMY
	Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know.  
	Now I'm afraid he could be next.
		
		KARA
	Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
		
		TOMMY
	Not just Kyle.  All of you.  His entire family. 
	   (reaching toward Kyle)
	Here.  Look at this.

Tommy opens the baby's quilt, revealing the blood mark smeared over 
his torso.  Kara's face registers terrified recognition.
		
		TOMMY
	   (continuing)
	It was there when I found him this morning.  It 
	looks like some kind of letter or number or --
		
		KARA
	It's a rune ... Thorn.
			
			CUT TO:

INT. JAMIE'S HOSPITAL ROOM / HALLWAY - NIGHT

POLICE on the scene.  A crying NURSE gives a statement.  A CRIME 
SCENE PHOTOGRAPHER snapps photographs as Jamie's bloody corpse is 
covered over with a white sheet.

Loomis stands frozen in horror.  Tears in his eyes.
		
		LOOMIS
	Jamie ... I failed you again.  I never should 
	have left you.

He spins, pouncing on Sheriff Holdt.
		
		LOOMIS
	   (continuing)
	Now will you do something?!  How many more 
	innocent people have to die?!

Wynn restrains him.  Pulls him away.  The sheriff doesn't budge.
		
		WYNN
	Don't do this to yourself, Sam.  Let's go.  
	Come on.

Wynn ushers Loomis out of the room.  Holdt stares apathetically.

HALLWAY (CONTINUOUS)

Wynn tries to calm Loomis down.  Jamie's doctor approaches.
		
		DR. BONHAM
	Dr. Loomis?
		
		WYNN
	What is it?
		
		DR. BONHAM
	I'm very sorry ...
		
		LOOMIS
	You let it get to her.  How could you?
		
		DR. BONHAM
	Dr. Loomis, there's something else you should 
	know.  During surgery, we discovered that 
	Jamie's uterus was hemorrhaging.  We found 
	this. 
	   (displays a small vital)
	It's placental fluid.
		
		LOOMIS
	God in heaven.  You don't tell me she was --
		
		DR. BONHAM
	I estimate she gave birth no more than a few 
	hours before the attack.
		
		WYNN
	Then where's her baby?

Jamie's covered body is wheeled out past them.  Loomis regards Wynn 
with a look of abject fear.
		
		LOOMIS
	I think I may already know ...
			
			     CUT TO:

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT (SAME)

CLOSE ON a chapter heading.  "Thorn - The Devil's Rune."  Beneath 
it, a bold depiction of the familiar Thorn triangle.

PULL BACK to REVEAL Tommy poring over the old library book.  Kara 
paces, rocking the baby, feeding him with the bottle.
		
		KARA
	Runes were a kind of early alphabet that 
	originated in Northern Europe thousands of 
	years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of 
	stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, 
	Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults 
	used them in blood rituals to portend future 
	events and invoke magic.
		
		TOMMY
	Black magic ... 
	   (reads)
	'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause 
	sickness, famine and death. Translated 
	literally, it was the name of a demon spirit 
	that delivered human sacrifices ... on the 
	Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
		
		KARA
	Halloween.
		
		TOMMY
	'When applied directly to another person, Thorn 
	could be used to call upon them confusion and 
	destruction -- to literally visit them with the 
	Devil.'

Tommy jumps up, frantically moving around the apartment, collecting 
his jacket, his keys -- a gun.
		
		KARA
	   (terrified)
	Where are you going?
		
		TOMMY
	To find the rest of your family before Michael 
	Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling 
	him.

An ominous CLICK as Tommy loads a cartridge into his gun.  He bolts 
toward the door.  Finds it standing wide open.  Kara freezes, 
noticing for the first time that Danny is missing.
		
		KARA
	Oh, God -- Where's Danny? Kara flies down the 
	hall, the baby in her arms.  Tommy moves out 
	right behind her.

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - LOBBY (CONTINUOUS)

Kara and Tommy barrel downstairs, searching frantically.
		
		KARA
	Danny?!  Danny!
		
		TOMMY
	Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy 
	who came in with me and --

They find Mrs. Blankenship and Danny sitting side by side, watching 
the Horrorthon.  A bowl of popcorn between them.
		
		KARA
	   (grabs him)
	Danny, don't ever walk off without telling me 
	where you're going!

Danny looks at her.  A blank, hollow stare.  The old woman's eyes 
glitter madly.
		
		MRS. BLANKENSHIP
	The voice.  He hears the voice.  Just like the 
	other little boy who used to live in that 
	house.

Tommy throws on his jacket and opens the front door.
		
		TOMMY
	Take the kids upstairs, lock the door and wait 
	for me. 
	   (beat)
	And Kara, whatever you do -- don't go back to 
	your house.

Kara watches fearfully as Tommy heads out the door.  Leaving her 
alone with the children.

EXT. HOUSES / STREET - NIGHT

Wind MOANS.  Dead leaves blow across the WINDY lane as Tommy flies 
down the path of the Blankenship house and hops into his Explorer.  
The Shape suddenly RISES INTO FRAME.  Watching him peel off down the 
block.  Taillights disappearing.

A moment later, another car rambles up the street, swerving 
erratically into the driveway of the Myers house.

The Shape watches.

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

The car parks.  Sits in silence.  Suddenly the driver's side door 
opens, emblazoned with the "Strode Realty" emblem.

John spills out, collar unbuttoned, tie dangling.  Picking himself 
up, he staggers out of the garage.  Laughing.  Singing.
		
		JOHN
	... Pretty woman, walking down the street ... 
	Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE (CONTINUOUS)

FOLLOW John's circuitous route across the front lawn, stumbling over 
one of Danny's toys on his way up the porch steps.
		
		JOHN
	Damn kid ... this is my house ...

John fumbles wth his key, estimates the location of the lock.  He 
turns the knob -- but the door's jammed.  Chain-locked.
		
		JOHN
	   (continuing)
	What the fuck ... 
	   (yelling inside)
	... Debra, open this goddamn door before I 
	break it down!  You got to three ... 
	   (no response)
	... One ... Two ... 
	   (still no response)
	... Two and a half ...

John slams his weight against the door.  It doesn't budge.

Grumbling, John totters off the porch, trying to hold himself 
steady.  Skirting along the side of the house.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN (CONTINUOUS)

John sways in through the back door and flicks on a light.  Strains 
for lucidity.  No one in the kitchen.
		
		JOHN
	Debra -- I'm home!

No answer.  John shrugs and moves to the stove.  Opens the lid on a 
pasta cooker.  Nothing inside.
		
		JOHN
	   (continuing; mutters)
	Work all day and not even any supper ...

Frustrated, John opens the freezer and removes a frozen dinner.  
Tears open the box and pops it in the microwave.  Then he flounders 
down the dark alley, knocking picture frames awry.

LIVING ROOM / FOYER

Darkness, save for a glowing jack-o'-lantern.  John stands there, 
listing.  Bewildered.

Then he switches on a lamp, kicks off his shoes and crashes onto his 
lumpy old recliner.
		
		JOHN
	All right ... You can all come out now ...

Still no reply.  John sneers, flicks on the television with the 
remote control and settles back into his chair.

INSERT - TELEVISION

A scene from another horror movie.  A boy shreds his pumpkin mask as 
a mass of beetles and snakes pour out of his skull.

BACK TO SCENE
		
		JOHN
	What is this shit?

Disgusted, he switches channels to the local NEWS.  A shrill BEEP 
from the kitchen startles him.  The microwave.

KITCHEN

John waddles to a drawer and removes a set of utensils.  Then he 
reaches for the microwave, opens it.  But his dinner is gone.

Spinning around, he sees the piping hot entree already sitting out 
on the kitchen table.  John double-takes, mentally retracing his 
steps.  Shrugs.

FOLLOW JOHN

as he picks up his tray and plods back down the hall.  Suddenly he 
trips over something -- the suitcase Debra had packed earlier, 
sitting smack-dead in the center of the hall.
		
		JOHN
	So this is the game you wanna play. Fine.  Go 
	ahead.  Keep it up all night ...

LIVING ROOM

John settles back into his chair and begins to eat ravenously.  
SCREAMS from the television.  He reacts.

INSERT - TELEVISION

Someone has switched it back to the horror movie.  A 
COMPUTER-GENERATED PUMPKIN causes more masked heads to EXPLODE.

BACK TO SCENE

John shakes the remote.  Out of the corner of his eye, he catches a 
shadowy figure darting by in the darkened foyer.
		
		JOHN
	Is that you, you little brat?  Danny?!

John rises, about to go for him when suddenly the power cuts out -- 
and the entire house is plunged into blackness.
		
		JOHN
	   (continuing)
	When I get my hands on you, kid, you're gonna 
	wish you were never born!

John pulls a rechargeable flashlight from the wall and goes to the 
cellar door.  It stands open.  An invitation to enter.
		
		JOHN
	   (continuing)
	Oh, I'm scared.  I'm really scared.

With that, John steps down into the basement.

INT. CELLAR (CONTINUOUS)

John tentatively descends the stairs.  Barefoot.  The flashlight 
beam preceding his every step.  A RUMBLING below.

The cellar is lit only by a shaft of moonlight cutting through the 
single dusty window.  John probes around, shining the flashlight 
over cobwebs, boxes -- the puddle of water at his feet.  Now 
flooding the entire floor.

John SLOSHES through the water toward the washing machine -- which 
is running at full tact.
		
		JOHN
	What the hell --

He opens the washer lid and lifts out a water-logged sheet.  It 
drips red onto the white appliance -- blood.

John backs away, loses his footing, and slips in the water -- 
landing right at the Shape's feet.  John SCREAMS as the Shape grabs 
him by the neck, lifts him off the floor with one hand, then carries 
him across the basement and SLAMS him brutally against the open fuse 
box.

The Shape's free hand lifts an enormous butcher knife.  A loud WHAP 
as it's driven to the hilt into John's chest, through the fuse box.  
Sparks wain from the wall.  Electricity courses through John's 
writing body.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE (SAME)

Lights flash on and off in the windows.  Suddenly the entire house 
is plunged into darkness.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR (SAME)

John's toes curl.  The skin around where the knife penetrates 
FRIES.  The Shape steps back, head tilted, BREATHING steadily, 
curiously observing John's hanging, lifeless body.

EXT. HARVEST FAIR - NIGHT

Tommy grabs the ticket he's just paid for, hands it to an ATTENDANT 
and moves through the turnstiles amid a steady stream of REVELLERS.

Loud MUSIC, the aroma of apple cider and pumpkin pie fills the air.  
Boots selling food and crafts.  Children carving jack-o'-lanterns.  
Parents beaming with pride.

Trendy co-eds playing games.  Ducking for apples.  Shooting 
pumpkin-faced balloons with water pistols.

EXT. LIBRARY STEPS

Tim and Beth sit on either side of Harry as he interviews them 
during a live BROADCAST.  A large crowd gathered below.
		
		HARRY SIMMS
	   (into mike)
	I'm here with Tim and Beth -- the organizers of 
	tonight's event.  How does it feel knowing 
	you've finally pulled Halloween out of the 
	closet?
		
		TIM
	   (into mike)
	Yo, Harry, it's great!  And having you here 
	with us is dope.  Totally raw. You're the 
	ultimate juice!
		
		HARRY SIMMS
	I'll remember that the next time my wife tells 
	me I didn't make her climax.
		
		BETH
	   (impassioned)
	What Tim means is that we've taken a firm stand 
	against censorship.  Not only for Haddonfield, 
	but for every town in the nation.  Our 
	generation will not let the powers-that-be 
	control our minds, dictate what clothes we 
	wear, what music we listen to, or what holidays 
	we celebrate.

Beth's rousing speech is met by gales of enthusiastic CHEERS.
		
		HARRY
	   (off-handedly)
	Have you ever considered running for public 
	office?
			
			     CUT TO:

EXT. HADDONFIELD STREETS - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT

The distant SOUNDS of the celebration are carried on the wings of 
the WIND.  Howling through dark, empty streets.  Rows of deserted 
houses.  Not a soul in sight.  Preternatural stillness.

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - NIGHT

Kara looks nervously out a window, then walks into the parlor where 
she finds Danny sitting in the dark, glued to the Horrorthon.  
Flames CRACKLE in the fireplace, casting weird shadows.

Mrs. Blankenship sits in a wooden rocker, cradling the infant, 
humming a lullaby.

If we look closely enough, behind her in the window we can see the 
hazy shadow of the Shape looking in.
		
		KARA
	Mrs. Blankenship, what did you mean about the 
	little boy who used to live across the street?

The old woman doesn't seem to hear her.  Lost in her own world.
		
		KARA
	   (continuing; insistent)
	Mrs. Blankenship, please.  This is important!

Mrs. Blankenship looks up sharply, startling Kara.
		
		MRS. BLANKENSHIP
	He heard the voice.  Same as your boy hears.
		
		KARA
	What voice?  What are you talking about?
		
		MRS. BLANKENSHIP
	The voice that spoke to Michael Myers. The one 
	that told him to kill his family.

Kara stares at her, numbed.  She gazes over at Danny, his eyes 
riveted  -- not to the TV screen.  Looking past it.  Across the 
street at the Myers house.  The haunting VOICE whispers to him.
		
		WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)
	I'm coming for you, Danny ... I'm coming.

EXT. HARVEST FAIR - NIGHT

Tim and Beth ride high atop the Ferris wheel.  Their smiling faces 
aglow in a dizzying whirlwind of LIGHTS.  DARK CLOUDS are gathering 
in the sky, covering the moon and stars.  A light RAIN begins to 
fall.

ANGLE ON TOMMY

Walking, searching, hunting.  Past a large tent where children are 
gathering.  A sign reads:  COSTUME PAGEANT.

Tommy reacts to a terrified SCREAM.  Just a couple of teenage BOYS 
pulling an innocuously fightened GIRL onto another ride.

THE STRANGER

walks steadily past the bright lights of the Ferris wheel.

TOMMY

pushes through a dense crowd.  Suddenly he bumps shoulders with the 
Stranger.  More people pass.  There was something very sinister 
about that man.

Tommy turns to look again, eyes widening in terror.

TOMMY'S P.O.V. - STRANGER'S WRIST

Branded with the mark of Thorn!

TOMMY

removes his gun.  Flows through the crowd like a vengeful wraith.

People see the gun in his hand and back away.  Tommy surges 
forward.  The Stranger walks faster.  Gaining ground.  Toward the 
Halloween tree.

WORKERS hauling wheelbarrows loaded with jack-o'-lanterns cross his 
path.  Tommy stumbles, pumpkins spilling out all around him.

The Stranger is getting away!  Tommy picks himself up, raises the 
gun and begins FIRING shots into the air.  People SCREAM, scattering 
like insects, ducking for cover.
		
		TOMMY
	Stop that man!  Stop him!!!

Tommy races through the horrified crowd.  The Stranger keeps moving, 
never once looking back.

Suddenly SIRENS.  Squad cars converge.  Sheriff Holdt and a slew of 
OFFICERS surround Tommy.  Weapons trained.
		
		HOLDT
	Throw down the gun!  Now!!!

Tommy drops the gun.  Puts his arms up in surrender.  The cops swarm 
in, taking him.
		
		TOMMY
	Stop that man!  He's the one!

ANGLE ON FERRIS WHEEL

Beth and Tim exit the ride and follow the crowd toward the flashing 
LIGHTS of the police cruisers.
		
		TIM
	Who's gettin' busted?

Beth is stunned to see Tommy being searched spread-eagle over the 
sheriff's car.
		
		BETH
	Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
		
		TIM
	Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my 
	sister?
		
		BETH
	   (worried)
	Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd 
	better go home and check on them. There's 
	nothing else for us to do here.
		
		TIM
	But they're gonna light the tree in a few 
	minutes --
		
		BETH
	   (suggestively)
	We can light our own tree at home.

She brushes against Tim's crotch and saunters away.  Tim glances 
back at Tommy, then follows her like a hungry puppy.

	his great- grandfather.
		
		KARA
	His what?!
		
		MRS. BLANKENSHIP
	Eighteen-ninety-five.  A hundred years ago to 
	this night.  All Hallows Eve. Murdered his 
	family in that very same house.  Then the

The Stranger glides unnoticed among a large crowd gathered for the 
lighting of the Halloween tree.  People putting up umbrellas.  A 
STORM fast approaching.

Hundreds of anxious kids stand beneath the oak tree with open bags 
and pillow cases, waiting for the candy to drop on them.

STALKING P.O.V

MOVING behind the tree where a long-haired figure stands in the 
darkness.  Waiting to make a presentation.

HARRY

turns, sensing a presence.  A knife shoots out of the darkness, 
jabbing him right between the legs.
			
			     CUT TO:

TOMMY

is shoved into the back of the squad car.  Suddenly Loomis appears.  
Prevailing upon the sheriff.
		
		LOOMIS
	Wait!  This boy is being placed in my custody.

Tommy looks out, stunned.
		
		HOLDT
	What are you trying to pull now, Loomis?
		
		LOOMIS
	Uncuff him!  This is a matter of life or death.
			
			     SHOCK CUT TO:

HARRY

The knife is lifted straight up, splitting his torso in two, eyes 
bugging with shock.  He slumps to the ground in a huge pool of 
blood.
			
			     CUT BACK TO:

TOMMY AND LOOMIS

The sheriff uncuffs Tommy and shoves him out of the car.
		
		HOLDT
	You'd better as fuck have an explanation for 
	this, Doctor.

Loomis begins to usher Tommy through the gaping crowd.
		
		TOMMY
	Dr. Loomis, there's something you should 
	know --

Tommy is prodded forward by Loomis's .357.
		
		LOOMIS
	I know enough already.  Just shut your mouth 
	and take me to that baby.

They move swiftly through the gaping crowd.

ANGLE ON TREE

A growing murmur of concern spreads.  "Where's Harry?"  The children are 
becoming impatient, and the impending STORM isn't doing much to calm 
anyone's nerves.  Harry's people are at a loss to explain their star's 
whereabouts.

ANGLE ON LOOMIS AND TOMMY

On the fringes of the crowd.  Walking away.

"Oohs" and "ahhs" as the tree suddenly comes to life with thousands of 
orange lights.  From the boughs of the tree, ropes are pulled.  Bunting 
tears open, dropping hails of CANDY on the SHRIEKING kids.

Tommy glances back.  His eyes drawn to something.  Grotesque and misshapen.  In the 
tree.
		
		TOMMY
	Oh my God --

ANGLE ON TREE

Kids of all ages scurry around the stage, laughing and screaming as a 
rainbow of candy RAINS down on them.  Diving for it.  Fighting over it.  
Scooping it up in big handfuls.

ANGLE ON TOMMY AND LOOMIS

Tommy instantly breaks away and tears back through the crowd.
		
		LOOMIS
	Tommy!

Loomis goes for him.  Sheriff Holdt sees what is happening and 
flies toward them in pursuit.

ANGLE ON TREE

A BALLERINA looks down at her white pillow case in horrified 
astonishment.  Her hands painted red as she reaches inside.  All 
of her candy is covered with blood!

The other kids back away in revulsion -- the entire stage begins 
to drip with blood!

The adults don't seem to notice what is happening, more concerned 
with the sudden burst of POURING RAIN.

Tommy pushes his way through the crowd, SCREAMING.
		
		TOMMY
	Get them out of there!  Get out!!!

Sheriff Holdt tries to intercept Tommy just as he leaps up onto 
the stage, pushing kids out of the way.

Parents' faces register shock when they see their children running 
toward them, SCREAMING hysterically, soaked with blood.

Loomis sees what Tommy sees.  Words cannot convey the horror in his 
eyes.

Just then, a BOLT OF LIGHTNING ignites the tree.  SPARKS flash.  
Tiny pumpkin lights EXPLODE in a startling chain reaction.

Tommy helps the last of the kids off the stage when something falls 
from the gnarled branches:  a dangling, rotating, wrapped-up thing.  
The mutilated remains of Harry Simms!

Horrified, Tommy dashes headlong off the stage.  Runs with Loomis 
with the trampling crowd.

Struck dumb with terror, Holdt looks out upon the mass destruction.  
The bloody corpse hanging from the tree.  People running, SCREAMING, 
carrying their children toward the exits.

EXT. CAMPUS PARKING LOT (SAME)

Bumper to bumper cars.  Horns BLARING.  Women SCREAMING.  Men SHOUTING.  
Children CRYING.  Pandemonium.

Loomis and Tommy appear out of this jumble of confusion.  More people 
running along the sidewalks.
		
		TOMMY
	Oh, God -- Kara!!!

A car SCREECHES to a halt as Tommy barrels across the street.  Loomis 
right behind him.  Running toward home.

Once again, terror reigns in Haddonfield, Illinois.
			
			     CUT TO:

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Kara shivers as she curls up beside Danny on the futon, holding the 
sleeping baby close at her bosom.  THUNDER rattles the old house.
		
		DANNY
	Mommy, I'm scared.
		
		KARA
	There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another 
	storm.  Try to get some sleep.
		
		DANNY
	I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
		
		KARA
	No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
		
		DANNY
	Promise?
		
		KARA
	   (kisses him)
	I promise.

Kara stands up and goes to the window, looking out into the 
pouring RAIN.

KARA'S P.O.V. - THE MYERS HOUSE

Dark and foreboding.  LIGHTNING FLASHES.  Beth's car parked in 
front.

ANGLE ON KARA

She stares at the car, puzzled.  Quickly she moves away from the 
window, heads out the door.

HALLWAY

She KNOCKS loudly on the door across the hall.  A sign that reads:  
"Beth's Place."
		
		KARA
	Beth, are you in there?

She knocks again.  No response.  Another CLAP OF THUNDER.  Kara 
shudders, quickly returns to Tommy's apartment and locks the door.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - FOYER (CONTINUOUS)

Sounds of PASSION as we FOLLOW a trail of hastily-discarded costume 
pieces across the darkened foyer.  Tim and Beth are on the stairs, 
half-naked, kissing fervently.
		
		BETH
	   (coming up for air)
	Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
		
		TIM
	   (hot and heavy)
	Guess so ...

Tim nuzzles his face in Beth's chest.  She's feeling apprehensive.
		
		BETH
	What if your parents come home?
		
		TIM
	Then they can watch.

Laughing, they heard up the stairs, kissing, fondling each other.  
Slowly we PULL BACK into the foyer.  THUNDER and LIGHTNING CLASH, 
revealing the Shape, knife held at ready.  Watching.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT (SAME)

She picks up the cordless phone, switches on and dials her home 
number.  We HEAR the phone RINGING on the other end.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Beth collapses with Tim onto Kara's bed.  The PHONE RINGS.  Tim 
ignores it, consumed by passion.  Beth sits up nervously.
		
		BETH
	Aren't you gonna answer that?
		
		TIM
	Answer what?
		
		BETH
	   (fends him off)
	What if it's Kara?

Frustrated, Tim jumps off the bed and stomps into the bathroom, 
taking a candle with him.
		
		TIM
	Fine.  You answer it.  I'll make friends with my soap on a 
	rope.

Tim slams the door.  Beth deliberates her move, then goes to pick 
up the phone.
		
		BETH
	   (into phone)
	Hello?

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Kara is frantic.  Looking out the window at the Myers house.
		
		KARA
	   (into phone)
	Mom -- Who is this?
		
		BETH (V.O.)
	Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
		
		KARA
	What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM (SAME)
		
		BETH
	We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if 
	you were --
		
		KARA (V.O.)
	Is Tim there?
		
		BETH
	He's in the bathroom.

BATHROOM - SHOWER (CONTINUOUS)

A lighted candle flickers.  Tim waits for the running shower to 
warm up as he does a bare-ass jig over to the sink.

Rinsing off his tooth brush, he elbows out a circle of steam from 
the mirror.  He gasps.  The Shape is standing right behind him!

Before he can react, Tim's head is yanked backwards.  The chilling 
SNAP of his neck is punctuated by a CRASH OF THUNDER.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Kara can SEE Beth on the phone.  Sitting by the window.
		
		KARA
	I'm across the street.  I can see you. Beth, I want you to 
	listen to me.  Get Tim and get out of that house.  Right 
	now.

Unnoticed by Kara, Danny rises and crosses the room.  Drawn toward 
the door by the irascible voice.
		
		WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)
	Come to me, Danny ... Come to me.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM

Beth shifts nervously, looking out across the way at Kara.

THUNDER drowns out the sound of the bathroom door CREAKING open.  The 
Shape advances.
		
		BETH
	Kara, what the hell is going on?

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Kara's mouth suddenly drops open.  Her mind snaps into sensory overload.  
She can see the Shape walking up behind Beth!  Raising a gleaming 
butcher knife!
		
		KARA
	Beth, look out!  There's someone in the room!  He's right 
	behind you!

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM

Beth drops the phone, eyes bulging as the Shape plunges the knife 
into her back.  She falls, CRASHING against the vanity.

Beth SCREAMS unholy terror.  But the Shape isn't through.

INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Kara stands frozen in pure horror, hearing and seeing her friend's 
vicious murder.

Her eyes shoot down.  A little blond-haired boy is walking steadily 
across the street toward the Myers house.

No, it can't be true.  Kara wheels around.  Danny is gone.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM - ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW

Danny can be seen below walking toward the house as Beth's 
blood-gurgling SCREAMS fill the room.  The knife repeatedly, 
mercilessly SLASHING down at her.

EXT. STREET / MYERS HOUSE - NIGHT

Kara bolts out of the Blankenship house and races across the street, 
chasing after Danny through RAIN and LIGHTNING.
		
		KARA
	Danny, no!!!

KARA'S P.O.V. - FOLLOWING DANNY

He glides up the porch steps and slips through the front door of the 
Myers house.  Disappearing inside.

KARA

shoots across the lawn.  Up the porch steps.  Right behind him.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - FOYER

Kara dives through the front door.  THUNDER shatters the house.  
Everything is frighteningly dark.  Shockingly quiet.

Inch by inch, she makes her way inside.  Eyes wide.  Savage.  
Shaking uncontrollably.  A CRASHING SOUND behind her.  She jumps out 
of her skin.  Just the door SLAMMING shut in the WIND.
		
		KARA
	   (the faintest whisper)
	Danny?

She advances into the hall.  Old floorboards CREAK beneath her feet.  
SOUNDS up ahead.  FOOTSTEPS.

Kara looks up.  LIGHTNING FLASHES.  Danny is nearing the top of the 
stairs!

Instinct propels her up the stairs after him.  Then suddenly she stops 
dead.  Reason taking over.  And she turns back.

Picks up a fireplace poker sitting in the corner.  Then she heads back 
up the stairs.  Mind-blown with horror.

UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Kara reaches the top of the staircase, looking down the dark hallway.  
Summoning all of her courage, she moves forward.

Suddenly Danny darts out from the adjacent hall and disappears inside 
his bedroom -- a fleeting, ghostly image.  Kara startles.  Follows him 
inside.

DANNY'S BEDROOM

Danny stands in a corner.  LIGHTNING illuminates his toy dinosaurs.  
Kara goes to him, takes his hand.  He resists her.
		
		KARA
	   (intense whisper)
	Come on ... Danny, please.

She picks him up, carries him toward the door.  LUMBERING FOOTSTEPS.  
Kara stands paralyzed in the doorway as the Shape stalks down the hall.  
Eyes probing.  Walking right past them.

DANNY'S BEDROOM

Kara slips silently back into the room, carrying Danny through the 
bathroom.  Adjoining on the opposite side into

KARA'S ROOM

LIGHTNING CRACKLES.  The walls are covered with blood.  Kara stumbles 
over something on the floor.  Cranes her neck to look down.

Beth's bloody, mangled remains at her feet.

Shock waves send Kara reeling backwards against the open bathroom door.  
Hanging on a hook is Tim's naked body, eyes open, staring at her in a 
horrified rictus of death.

Kara SCREAMS.  Drops Danny.  Quickly covers her mouth.  Realizing that 
she's given them away.

Suddenly the bedroom door tears open, buckling off its hinges.  The 
Shape bulldozes in, wielding its huge butcher knife!
		
		KARA
	Danny, run!!!

Danny ducks into the hall, evading the Shape's lurching hands.

DANNY

careens down the stairs.  THUNDER RAGES.

KARA

brandishes the fireplace poker at the killer.  The Shape moves in, 
backing her through the bathroom ... into Danny's room.  Suddenly 
she SLAMS the door on the Shape.

Kara tears off into the hallway.  Turns.  Waiting for the Shape to 
appear.  It doesn't.

Kara vacillates down the hall.  Jumping at every sound.  Training her 
weapon at things unseen.  SLAMMING doors along the way, sealing off 
every passageway as she tries to find her way through the impenetrable 
dark tunnel.

Suddenly something CRASHES down from above.  Kara's mother, strung up on 
a bloody sheet, dangling upside-down from the trap door in the ceiling! 
The axe still protruding from her chest.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Kara SCREAMS, shrinking away from the gruesome sight, faltering through 
the blackened doorway behind her.  An unbearable moment of tension as we 
think the Shape's mask will be there.

Suddenly the Shape shoots up directly in front of her!  Tearing the 
dangling corpse from the sheet, dislodging the axe from Debra's chest 
with a repulsive SQUISH.

Kara wheels toward the stairs.  The Shape advances.  Swings the axe.  
Misses her by inches.  Kara ducks, lurches behind the Shape.  Swings 
the fireplace poker with everything she's got.  CRACKING it full-force 
over the back of the Shape's head.

The Shape breaks through the banister and plunges off the landing, 
SLAMMING hard onto the floor below.

Terrified, Kara chances a look down.  The Shape doesn't move.

EXT. STREET / BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - NIGHT (SAME)

Tommy's Explorer skids to a stop outside the boarding house.  Loomis and 
Tommy fly up the front path.  Tommy glances back at the blackened Myers 
house for a moment, then follows Loomis inside.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY (SAME)

Kara barrels off the stairs.  Moves cautiously past the Shape.  Sprawled 
face-up in the middle of the hall.

LIVING ROOM

Kara searches for Danny, keeping her eyes trained on the Shape.  The 
little boy appears in the doorway directly across the hall.

The Shape lying in between them.
		
		KARA
	Danny, come to Mommy.

Danny shakes his head.  Too frightened to move.

HALLWAY / FOYER

Ever so slowly, Kara moves toward the threshold.  Hefting the fireplace 
poker, she steps right over the Shape.

Instantly she snatches Danny up in her arms.  Takes one step forward when 
suddenly --
		
		DANNY
	Mommy!!!

The Shape springs up, twisting Kara's ankle.  She falls, splaying forward.  
The Shape claws at her leg.  Kara fights back, kicking herself free of the 
vice-like grip.

Scrambling to her feet, Kara rockets Danny through the foyer to the front 
door -- desperately trying to escape from this real-life house of horrors 
-- only to find that it is locked.

The Shape rises, gleaming butcher knife in hand.

Kara twists the deadbolt, but someone's secured the chain lock!  Too late 
to remove it.  The Shape is right behind them.

Only one way to go.  The cellar.  Kara shoves Danny through.

INT. CELLAR (CONTINUOUS)

Kara and Danny clatter down the rickety stairs and SPLASH across the flooded 
basement floor.

A soul-shuddering POUNDING on the door above.

Kara ushers Danny toward the elevated window.

The cellar door EXPLODES, the Shape's hand breaking through, splintering 
the wood as if it were paper.

Kara HEARS the Shape moving rapidly down the stairs.  Lifts Danny up the 
wall toward the window.  But it's not a wall -- it's John's electrocuted 
body, propped inside a storage cabinet!

Danny SHRIEKS, staring into John's lifeless eyes.  Kara pushes him up.  
Danny reaches for the lock.  Just an inch away.

Kara can't lift him any higher.  The Shape is coming!

Danny hoists himself up just enough to twist the lock.  He pushes the 
window open and clambers outside.

Kara scrambles up old pressboard shelves.  They break under her weight; 
she topples back to the floor.

The Shape wades toward her.  Reaching up for the window.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - BASEMENT WINDOW

Danny watches his mother struggle to climb out of the crypt.
		
		KARA
	Danny, help me!

Kara's hand reaches toward him.  Danny makes no movement.
		
		WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)
	Come to me, Danny ... Come to me.

Danny obediently turns and starts to walk away.
		
		KARA
	Danny!!!

INT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR

Kara's foot falls on the handle of the knife jutting from her father's 
chest.  Uses it to springboard herself half-way through the window.  
Clawing at wet grass.

The Shape's hand shoots out of the darkness below, grabbing at her legs.  
Kara writhes, kicking and SCREAMING.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR WINDOW

Kara grabs chunks of mud as she is pulled back through the window.  The 
Shape yanks hard.  Kara catches herself on the window frame.  Quickly 
losing her grip.

INT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR

The knife swipes downward, swiping her ankle.

EXT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR WINDOW

Kara reacts to the searing pain, releasing her grip on the window frame.  
Suddenly Danny appears, locking onto her collar, pulling her clear in one 
massive heave.

Kara shuffles across the ground and picks herself up.  Grabs Danny's hand 
and runs full-tilt around the side of the house.

EXT. STREET / BLANKENSHIP HOUSE

CAMERA FOLLOWS their frenzied flight across the street.  Past Tommy's 
Explorer.  Kara limping.  Danny surging toward the Blankenship house.  Kara 
SCREAMS, pounding frantically on the door.
		
		KARA
	Please!  Open the door!

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Tommy and Loomis have turned the apartment upside-down.
		
		TOMMY
	The baby -- where's the baby?!

Suddenly they HEAR Kara's frantic pleas outside.  Tommy bolts out the door.
Loomis right behind him.

EXT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE (CONTINUOUS)

Kara POUNDS furiously.
		
		KARA
	Please!  Somebody help us!

Danny huddles beside her, peering out across the street.

DANNY'S P.O.V. - MYERS HOUSE

The Shape trudges boldly down the porch steps -- knife in hand!

BACK TO SCENE

Kara sees the Shape -- walking slowly and deliberately toward them.  Her 
SCREAMS become even more intense.
		
		KARA
	Help us please!!!

The Shape closes in.  At the last second, Tommy throws open the door.  Kara 
and Danny tumble inside.  Into his arms.

INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - LOBBY / PARLOR (CONTINUOUS)

Loomis slams and deadbolts the door.
		
		LOOMIS
	Get them upstairs.  Now!

Kara pounds against Tommy's chest.  Hysterical.
		
		KARA
	Where's the baby?!
		
		TOMMY
	He's gone.

Kara holds Danny close to her side, backing away in horror as Tommy and 
Loomis go around the parlor, securing the doors and windows.  THUNDER RIPS 
through the darkened room.
		
		TOMMY
	   (continuing)
	Who else knew I had the baby?!
		
		LOOMIS
	No one.
		
		TOMMY
	No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
		
		LOOMIS
	Only me -- 
	   (dark realization)
	-- and Dr. Wynn.

Suddenly the window behind Kara EXPLODES.  She SCREAMS, recoiling.  Then 
the window in front of her.  HANDS reach through.  Tommy shoves her out of 
the way.

ANOTHER HAND shoots through the stained glass window in the front door, 
twists open the lock.

Danny races across the lobby and up the stairs.

Robed figures fill the doorways.  Climbing through windows.  Moving inside 
the house.  Surrounding Loomis.
		
		LOOMIS
	   (continuing)
	Wynn!!!

The robed figures descend on Loomis.  Drops his .357.  Tommy lurches for it, 
to no avail.  Loomis's SCREAM fills the darkness like a fever dream.
		
		LOOMIS
	   (continuing)
	Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
		
		TOMMY
	No!!!

Tommy backpedals up the stairs.  Kara pulling him along as the cloaked 
figures glow toward them.  Daggers raised.

UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Kara reacts to the SOUND of Danny's VOICE.
		
		DANNY
	Mommy!  Please help me!

Kara rushes through darkness to find him.
		
		KARA
	Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
		
		TOMMY
	Kara, no!

Kara trips and falls.  A pair of silver-tipped black boots planted in 
bold stance.  Slowly she looks up the long duster, the cigarette in the 
gloved hand of the nefarious Stranger -- Dr. Wynn!  Danny stands by his 
side, staring dispassionately.
		
		KARA
	Danny, no ... please ...

Kara picks herself up, shaking her head in unmitigated fear, staggering 
back down the hallway.

She turns to see the black figures overtaking Tommy.  His SCREAMS 
swallowed by hollow darkness.

Alone, Kara careens through another doorway into

TOMMY'S APARTMENT

Kara slams the door, turns in desperate circles.

Stepping out from behind the door is Mrs. Blankenship -- the baby bundled 
in her arms!
		
		KARA
	Mrs. Blankenship -- Oh, God -- Hurry. We have to --

As Kara reaches for the baby, the old woman raises a dagger.  Her eyes 
burning.  Her wrist branded with the mark of Thorn!

Kara SCREAMS.  The old woman opens the door, allowing the figures to 
enter the room.  Daggers drawn.  CHANTING a dark invocation.

The coven forces Kara backwards.  Nowhere to run.  Nowhere to hide.

Suddenly Kara makes a decision -- and takes a running leap toward the 
window!

EXT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE (CONTINUOUS)

Defenestrating herself, Kara SCREAMS, tumbling through the air, bouncing 
off the porch overhang before plunging to the front lawn below.  A 
thousand grass fragments raining down on her.

KARA

lies on her back, eyes close, hands folded over her chest in silent 
repose.  She doesn't move.

THE HOUSE

is still.  Unearthly silence fills the cold October night.
			
			     SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

KARA'S P.O.V. - DISTORTED - INT. TUNNELS

A ring of faceless figures move in, completely surrounding her.

Suddenly the feeling of RAPID MOVEMENT.  Glowing torchlight flickers 
across dank walls.

KARA

is being pushed forward on a gurney.  Strapped down.  SCREAMING for God's 
mercy.

TOMMY

is wheeled through another tunnel.  His face a mass of bloody cuts and 
bruises.  His eyes glazed over, trying to find focus.  SLAMMING into 
darkness.

EXT. SANITARIUM - NIGHT

LIGHTNING illuminates the cold, forbidding asylum.  The white van pulls up 
to the security gate.  Headlights illuminate the sign:  "SMITH'S GROVE - 
WARREN COUNTY SANITARIUM."

The main gate cranks open.  The van pulls through.

THE VAN

pulls to a stop near the main building.  The door slides open and Danny 
steps out, surrounded by Smith's Grove staff wearing white jackets.  
Leading him toward the entrance.

LANDING FIELD

The helicopter touches down.  Wynn ducks out, moving in long, even strides 
toward the building.

INT. SANITARIUM CORRIDOR - NIGHT

FOLLOW Wynn through the series of security cages, using his key card to 
BUZZ through.  White coats bringing up the rear.

Through tall mahogany doors, they cross purposefully into the adjacent wing.

EXECUTIVE RECEPTION AREA

Dawn, Wynn's efficient secretary, rises with a congenial smile.
		
		DAWN
	Good evening, Dr. Wynn.  Your -- appointment is waiting 
	inside.

Wynn picks up his messages, then heads straight into the office.  Dawn 
resumes her typing.  Something eerie in her grin.

INT. WYNN'S OFFICE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Wynn and his staff file inside.  Removing his hat and duster, he walks over 
to where Loomis is seated -- shackled to a chair, a bloody slash across 
his forehead.

Seeing this, Wynn snaps angrily at two burly GUARDS.
		
		WYNN
	What is this all about?  Remove those!

The guards comply.  Loomis rubs his aching wrists, glowering.
		
		LOOMIS
	Where's the child?
		
		WYNN
	Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday 
	happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. 
	Somehow I knew you still had it in you.

Loomis sees his .357 resting atop Wynn's desk -- only inches away.  Wynn's 
hand covers it, slips it inside the top drawer.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know 
	how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your 
	upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I 
	felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth. 
	   (gestures to his staff)
	After all, you're the only one around here who's still in 
	the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell 
	you, but you've really given me no other choice.
		
		LOOMIS
	This is madness, Wynn.
		
		WYNN
	Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way 
	things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by 
	your own reality to see. 
	   (beat)
	But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in 
	many ways. 
	   (smiles)
	You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog.  
	Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his 
	work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last 
	time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible 
	time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
		
		LOOMIS
	It was you.
		
		WYNN
	   (lights a cigarette)
	Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
		
		LOOMIS
	Why did you take Jamie?
		
		WYNN
	She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her 
	veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I 
	incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has 
	served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
		
		LOOMIS
	Jamie's baby ...
		
		WYNN
	There you go trying to make sense again. 
	   (grimly entranced)
	It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations.  
	As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
		
		LOOMIS
	Samhain.
		
		WYNN
	And I'm its deliverer. 
	   (slams his key card on the desk)
	Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it.  
	Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.

Loomis shudders, rocked by these revelations.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	I know you have more questions, my friend, and there's so 
	much more for you to try to make sense of.

Loomis is hoisted out of his chair and led out of the office.  Wynn and 
his white coats flow out behind him.

INT. CELL - NIGHT

A tight, damp, claustrophobic space.  Tommy is strapped upright to a crude 
metal rack, not unlike the one Jamie was bound to the night before.

Feverishly he rubs his wrists against a jagged metal edge, cutting through 
skin, wearing away his bonds.  Breaking through.

INT. TUNNELS - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

A group of white coats, led by Wynn, usher Loomis off an old service 
elevator, leading him through the dark passageway.  Wynn turns around, 
surveying the tunnel.  As he walks on, we SEE something fall from his back 
pocket.

As they disappear down another tunnel, a wooden door slowly CREAKS open.  
Tommy appears, cautiously stepping out into the catacombs.  Edging along 
the dank, torch-lit walls.  WIND MOANS.  Rats scamper past his feet.

Wynn has dropped his security key card.  Tommy swipes it.

INT. CATWALK (SAME)

Loomis is led across a narrow precipice overlooking a filthy prison cell.  
The Shape lies inside.  Dormant.

Wynn stares down hypnotically at his most prized possession.  Michael Myers.
		
		WYNN
	Look at him.  So silent, yet so deadly. He moves when I 
	tell him to.  Act on my impulses.  Feels what I feel.

Wynn demonstrates.  Loomis looks on, spellbound.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	Michael -- Rise.

Below, the Shape slowly rises.  Wynn takes out his trusted switchblade.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	Michael -- Pain.

Wynn cuts his hand.  The Shape grabs his own hand in agony.  Wynn smiles, 
sucking the bleeding gash.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	Michael -- Kill.

Suddenly Wynn whirls around, throwing Dawn -- his faithful secretary -- 
inside the Shape's pit.  Wynn watches with hideous delight as her horrified 
SCREAMS trail away into blood-gurgling SILENCE.

Loomis closes his eyes in anguish.
		
		LOOMIS
	You've created a monster.
		
		WYNN
	Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.

Wynn carries on without remorse.  Loomis is brutally shoved forward.
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	We're not the only ones, you know. There are many 
	believers -- generous contributors to our church.  You'd be 
	amazed to know how far it reaches.

INT. CATACOMBS - STORAGE BUNKER

A metal door BUZZES open.  Tommy makes his way furtively inside, 
pocketing the key card.

A storage room filled with sawdust and wooden crates.  Tommy pries one of 
them open.  Eyes widening in startled disbelief.

A small arsenal of automatic rifles and ammunition inside.
		
		TOMMY
	Holy shit ...

Tommy lifts a rifle, awed by its devastating lines, then slams in a 
cartridge and bolts out the door.  Back into the tunnels.

INT. CEREMONIAL ROOM - NIGHT

A large, amber-hued chamber.  The CHANTING coven forms a circle around a 
primitive stone altar where Kara is tied down, wearing a white gown, her 
head adorned with a wreath of mistletoe.

A wooden symbol of Thorn, like an inverted crucifix, hangs in a place of 
reverence.

Behind the altar, the Shape stands in its cell.  Waiting.

Loomis is led inside.  Wynn glides through this macabre gathering, up to 
the altar.  Looming over the terrified Kara.

The CHANTING continues as Wynn dons a magnificent ceremonial robe.  At 
Wynn's gesture, there is SILENCE.  The worshippers offer an obedient 
response, removing their hoods, baring the mark of Thorn on their wrists.

We recognize many of the faces in the congregation.  Wynn's staff.  Dr. 
Bonham.  Mrs. Blankenship.  The cross-eyed attendant from the bus depot.  
People from all walks of life.

Faces glazed with sadistic rapture.
		
		WYNN
	   (prophetically)
	Behind, Disciples of Thorn!  The final sign!  The birth of 
	the heretic child, delivered unto us on the eve of our 
	great Feast of the Sun ... as I have foreseen it.

Jamie's baby is carried forth, CRYING as it is lain inside a baptismal urn 
beside Kara.  Ringed by candles and a circle of stones -- eleven in all -- 
etched with symbolic runes.

INT. TUNNELS

Letting the rifle guide him, Tommy makes his way through the tunnels.  
Toward the sound of MUFFLED CHANTING up ahead.

CEREMONIAL ROOM

The coven CHANTS its invocation.  Wynn draws a magic circle around the 
infant with blood from a silver chalice.  Then he inscribes a pentagram in 
the air with an ornate dagger.
		
		WYNN
	Spirits and powers of the flame, attend and witness this 
	ritual.  Bear our gifts to Thorn.  Open us to the path of 
	Darkness.  By these runes transform us. Open our eyes and 
	show us the Chosen One to whom we offer this sacrifice of 
	Innocent Blood.

Suddenly Danny is issued forth up to the altar.  His eyes dark, lifeless 
pools.  Kara struggles against her bonds.
		
		KARA
	Danny!!!

Loomis lurches forward.  Halted by massive, restraining hands.

CATWALK

Tommy moves cautiously along the narrow wooden lip, looking down upon the 
evil ritual.  Startled by the SOUND of rusted chains.  Pulleys CRANKING.  
The Shape's cell being opened.

CEREMONIAL ROOM

The Shape emerges from its cell and slowly walks forward.  Strangely calm.  
Hypnotized.  Looming above Kara.  She lets out a SCREAM of unbridled terror 
as he raises a gleaming dagger.

Wynn stands behind Danny.  Places the dagger in his hand and holds it aloft.
Above the baby.
		
		WYNN
	Strong and fierce Thorn, Thundered, by thy hammer we summon 
	thee and offer this sacrifice of innocent blood.  Let thy 
	Darkness descend on your son. Danny.  Lord of the Dead.

Danny drifts into the dark spell, holding the dagger above the SCREAMING 
infant.  Wynn speaks in the ominous WHISPERING VOICE:
		
		WYNN
	   (continuing)
	Kill for him, Danny ... Kill for him.

Kara cries, appealing to the boy inside of Michael.
		
		KARA
	Michael, please.  You can make him stop.  You remember, 
	don't you?

The Shape stares hard at her through the sockets of its mask.  Listening.  
Reminded of his mother.
		
		KARA
	   (continuing)
	Remember what he did to you that night. What his voice told 
	you to do.  You can stop it, Michael.  Stop the voice 
	forever.

Danny's eyes flash like fire.  The CHANTING is insidious.
		
		WYNN
	Kill him, Danny.  Kill him!
		
		KARA
	Danny, don't listen!  The voice isn't real!

Danny turns sharply, seeing his mother.  Suddenly terrified.
		
		WYNN
	Kill him, Danny!  You feel the rage inside!  You are Thorn!

Suddenly Danny drops the dagger.  Wynn flies at him, SCREAMING like an 
enraged beast.  The Shape raises its dagger and plunges it -- into Wynn!

Wynn's eyes go wide with shock.  The Shape lurches empathetically.  Wynn 
staggers, yanks the blade from his stomach.

RAPID-FIRE GUNSHOTS rip through the chamber as Tommy lets loose a barrage 
of bullets from above.  Taking out several coven members, the rest scattering,
retreating into the tunnels.

Loomis dives Danny a split second before he through Kara's bonds with the 
dagger.

Kara springs toward the baby as the room is ripped apart by GUNFIRE.  The 
altar decimated.  Candles falling.  Setting the room ablaze.

Wynn releases the supports which suspend the catwalk.  Wooden girders CRASH 
down from the ceiling.  Tommy pitches to the floor, dropping the rifle.

The Shape staggers, trying to get to its feet.  Slowly.  Painfully.  Flames 
lapping at its back.

Loomis crawls toward the rifle.  Grabs it.  Rises just as Wynn seizes Danny, 
a dagger at his throat.  Pulling him away.
		
		LOOMIS
	No!!!
		
		WYNN
	Stay away, Sam.
		
		LOOMIS
	Leave the boy.  Take me.

Loomis slowly places the rifle down in front of Wynn.  Surrendering himself.

Tommy drags himself toward Kara and the baby.  Paralyzed with horror as they try to 
anticipate Wynn's move.
		
		WYNN
	   (smiles trenchantly)
	Good-bye, Dr. Loomis.

Loomis turns.  Gasps in startled reflex.  The Shape rises up behind him, 
swiping the dagger across his chest!

Wynn retreats and flies through a doorway with Danny.
		
		DANNY
	Mommy!!!
		
		KARA
	Danny!!!

Tommy and Kara race across the flame-engulfed room, reaching the door just 
as it SLAMS shut.  Cutting them off.

The Shape, the trail of flames growing on its back, hurls Loomis over the 
crushed altar.

Tommy sees Loomis writhing on the floor, about to go for him when --

The Shape turns on them!  Tommy stands in front of Kara and the baby, 
backing away, propelling them out into the tunnels.

The Shape walks forward in fevered pursuit, all but consumed by fire.

TUNNELS

Tommy, Kara and Danny race deep into the heart of the tunnel maze.

LOOMIS

painfully crawls away.
		
		LOOMIS
	Die, Michael.  In the name of God, die!

END OF TUNNEL

Tommy, Kara and Danny reach the tunnel end.  Kara pounds frantically on the 
elevator panel.  A DEAFENING ROAR -- the SOUND of fire as the Shape sweeps 
toward them.

THE SHAPE

glides steadily through the tunnels.  A walking pillar of flame.  Undaunted.  
Unstoppable.  Hell-spawned.

END OF TUNNEL

Finally the doors open.  Kara and Tommy barrel inside.  Mashing buttons until 
the doors close -- a millisecond before the Shape reaches them.

INT. ELEVATOR

Kara cradles the baby.  Tommy waits anxiously as the old elevator MOANS and 
GRINDS toward ground level.  The doors open.

INT. SANITARIUM CORRIDOR

They barrel off the elevator and race down a long corridor.
		
		TOMMY
	This way!

Tommy leads her toward an exit sign.  Behind them, the elevator doors close. 
The indicator light shows it moving down.

They reach a dead end.  The row of coded security cages.
		
		KARA
	What now?!
		
		TOMMY
	   (realization)
	Wait a minute ...

He reaches into his pocket -- withdrawing Wynn's key card!

Suddenly the elevator doors open.  FIRE GUSTS.  The Shape emerges, totally 
engulfed in flame.  The emergency sprinklers are activated.  Dousing the 
flames as it walks after them.

Tommy panics, runs the key card.  The gate BUZZES open.  They run through.  
The Shape's hands lurch through the bars, missing Kara by inches.

They race toward the next gate.  The gate behind them opens, and the Shape 
walks through!

Tommy runs the card again.  The gate BUZZES.  They slam it -- one step 
ahead of the Shape.

The third and final gate.  Tommy tries the card.  Nothing!
		
		KARA
	Come on!
		
		TOMMY
	   (tries it again)
	It's not working!

The Shape moves through the last gate.  Inside the cage with them!
		
		TOMMY
	   (continuing)
	Someone's controlling it!

INT. WYNN'S OFFICE (SAME)

Standing behind his computer, observing them on the security monitors, Dr. 
Wynn jams the card's access code.  Then he grabs his satchel and strides 
quickly out of the office.  Pulling Danny with him.

On the screens, we can SEE the Shape approaching.  Kara's SCREAM can almost 
be heard on the silent monitor.

INT. SECURITY CAGE (SAME)

Kara SCREAMS as the Shape rakes Tommy against the cage.  Kara cowers in the 
corner, protecting the baby.

EXT. SANITARIUM - FIELD - NIGHT (SAME)

Wynn races with Danny across the field toward the waiting helicopter.  
Getting ready for take-off as they duck inside.

INT. SECURITY CAGE

The Shape slams Tommy's head against the bars; he slumps to the floor.  Then 
turns its murderous attention on Kara and the baby.

INT. WYNN'S OFFICE

A hand reaches into the top desk drawer, removes the .357 and FIRES an entire 
round into the security console.  Destroying it.

The man holding the gun is Loomis.

INT. SECURITY CAGE

The door BUZZES open.  Kara drags Tommy and the baby out.  Slamming the door 
shut on the Shape.  Trapping it inside.

The Shape lurches against the bars in wild paroxysms.

EXT. SANITARIUM - LANDING FIELD

Tommy comes to as he races with Kara and the baby across the windswept field.  
Suddenly they stop dead, watching in horror as the helicopter lifts off.

Kara stands paralyzed with shock, looking skyward.  The helicopter disappears 
into the gloom-filled night.

Tommy drags Kara in another direction.  A vehicle parked nearby.  The white 
van.

INT. VAN (SAME)

Kara lifts the baby inside.  Tommy flops down in the driver's seat.  Face 
bruised and bloody.  A key in the ignition.

Kara holds Jamie's baby.  Tears falling.
		
		KARA
	How will we ever find him?

Tommy's gaze terrifies her.  He starts the engine and tears off toward the 
sanitarium gate.

Kara looks down at the baby, then stares numbly forward.

In the back of the van, we can SEE the the Shape's white mask.  Glowing in 
the darkness.  Emerging.

Kara and Tommy drive on, unaware.  And that, for now, is how we leave them.
			
			     FADE OUT.

               We get closer and closer until we see that the shape is a 
               Halloween mask. It is a large, full-head platex rubber 
               mask, not a monster or ghoul, but the pale, neutral features 
               of a man weirdly distorted by the rubber. .

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT./INT. MYERS HOUSE -- NIGHT -- SUBJECTIVE POV 
               (PANAGLIDE)

               It is night. We move toward the rear of a house through 
               Someone's POV. CAMERA MOVES UP to a Jack-o'-lantern glowing 
               brightly on a windowsill. It is a windy night and the 
               curtains around the Jack-o'-lantern ruffle back and forth.

               Suddenly we hear voices from inside the house.

                                     SISTER (V.O.)
                         My parents won't be back till ten.

                                     BOYFRIEND (V.O.)
                         Are you sure?

               Then LAUGHTER.

               The POV moves from the Jack-o'-lantern down to another 
               window and peers inside. We see the sister's bedroom through 
               the blowing curtains.

               Into the bedroom comes the SISTER, 18, very pretty. She 
               GIGGLES as the BOYFRIEND jumps into the room. Also 18, he 
               wears a Halloween mask and costume.

                                     BOYFRIEND
                              (continuing)
                         We're all alone, aren't we?

                                     SISTER
                         Michael's around someplace....

               The boyfriend grabs the sister and kisses her.

                                     SISTER
                              (continuing)
                         Take off that thing.

               The boyfriend rips off his mask. He is a handsome young 
               man underneath. They kiss again, this time with more 
               passion. The boyfriend begins to unbutton the sister's 
               blouse. She responds to him.

               The POV swings away from the window and begins to restlessly 
               pace back and forth, agitated, disturbed. We HEAR THE SOUNDS 
               of the sister and boyfriend inside the bedroom growing 
               more and more passionate.

               Finally the POV moves back up to the window. Inside through 
               the moving curtains, we see the sister and the boyfriend 
               on the bed, naked, making love.

               The POV springs back from the window and stalks quickly 
               down the side of the house, past the Jack-o'-lantern, around 
               to a door. Quietly the door is opened and the POV moves 
               inside.

               The POV glides silently through the house into the kitchen, 
               up to a drawer. The drawer is opened. A large butcher knife 
               is withdrawn.

               Then the POV swings around and moves to the kitchen door. 
               We look down a hallway to the front door. The boyfriend 
               steps out of the bedroom door, buttoning his shirt. The 
               sister stands in the doorway, a sheet wrapped around her.

                                     BOYFRIEND
                         I gotta go.

                                     SISTER
                         Will you call me tomorrow?

                                     BOYFRIEND
                         Yeah, sure.

                                     SISTER
                         Promise?

                                     BOYFRIEND
                         Yeah.

               They kiss again and the boyfriend walks to the front door.  
               The sister watches as he leaves and shuts the door behind 
               him. Then she turns and steps back into the bedroom.

               The POV moves slowly down the hall to the bedroom door and 
               peers around inside. The sister sits at her night-table 
               brushing her hair. She is still completely nude.

               Slowly the POV moves into the room. Suddenly we move down 
               to the discarded Halloween mask on the floor. The POV bends 
               down and picks it up. Then suddenly the POV is covered by 
               the mask and we see through the eye-holes.

               The POV moves up behind the sister. Sensing a presence, 
               she spins around and stares at the POV, covering her breasts 
               quickly.

                                     SISTER
                         Michael...?

               Suddenly the POV lunges forward. The sister continues to 
               stare incredulously. There is a rapid blur as the POV drives 
               the butcher knife into the sister's chest and out again 
               almost before we've seen it.

               The sister looks down at the blood forming at her hands, 
               then

               back up at the POV with an astonished disbelief.

               Then in a wild paroxysm the butcher knife blurs continuously 
               in and out of frame, slashing the sister mercilessly. She 
               begins to SCREAM, trying to fend off the blows with her 
               hands, then suddenly falls out of frame to the floor.

               The POV moves back away from the sister's lifeless body, 
               spins around and careens out of the bedroom.

               At top speed the POV races through the darkened house, to 
               the front door, out the door, down the steps and rapidly 
               up the street. The CAMERA careens along in frenzied flight, 
               up the sidewalk, up a small side alley, down someone's 
               backyard, then to a sudden, abrupt halt in front of MOTHER 
               and FATHER just coming out of a neighbor's house.

               Mother and Father stare at the POV, at first in puzzlement, 
               then slow, growing horror.

                                     MOTHER
                         Michael?

               CLOSE SHOT -- MICHAEL -- CRANE

               The father's hand reaches up and rips off the Halloween 
               mask, revealing MICHAEL, 6, underneath, a bright-eyed boy 
               with a calm, quiet smile on his face. CAMERA PULLS BACK, 
               revealing the blood-stained butcher knife in his hand, 
               then further back, CRANING UP past his parents standing 
               there, up from the neighbor's house to a HIGH SHOT of the 
               neighborhood as the sounds of POLICE SIRENS rise in the 
               distance.

               EXT. HIGHWAY -- RAIN -- NIGHT

               Two headlights appear in the darkness, backlighting the 
               rain that pours down on a lonely strip of highway. A station 
               wagon HISSES along the wet road surface.

               INT. STATION WAGON -- NIGHT

               The back seat is separated from the front by a wire-mesh 
               screen, much like a police car. MARION, 30, drives. She is 
               dressed in a crisp, white nurse's uniform. Next to her in 
               the passenger seat is SAM LOOMIS, a clinical psychiatrist. 
               He is a tough-looking man in his forties who flips through 
               pages in a manila folder.

                                     LOOMIS
                         ...then he gets another physical 
                         by the state, and he makes his 
                         appearance before the judge. That 
                         should take four hours if we're 
                         lucky, then we're on our way.

                                     MARION
                         What did you use before?

                                     LOOMIS
                         Thorazine.

                                     MARION
                         He'll barely be able to sit up.

                                     LOOMIS
                         That's the idea.  Here we are.

               POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD -- SANITARIUM

               Through the rain we see a large sign:

                       SMITH'S GROVE -- WARREN COUNTY SANITARIUM

               Behind the sign is the sanitarium itself, a cold-looking 
               building surrounded by a fence.

                                     LOOMIS
                              (Continuing)
                         The driveway's a few hundred yards 
                         up on your right.

                                     MARION
                         Are there any special instructions?

                                     LOOMIS
                         Just try to understand what we're 
                         dealing with here. Don't 
                         underestimate it.

                                     MARION
                         I think we should refer to 'it' as 
                         'him.'

                                     LOOMIS
                         If you say so.

                                     MARION
                         Your compassion is overwhelming, . 
                         Doctor.

               Loomis glances at Marion as she lights a cigarette. She 
               shoves the matches into the pack and tosses it on the 
               dashboard. Loomis stares at the cigarette pack. The pack 
               of matches reads: "The Rabbit in Red Lounge -- Entertainment 
               Nightly." Loomis turns his eyes back to the rain-slicked 
               road.

                                     LOOMIS
                         Ever done anything like this before?

                                     MARION
                         Only minimum security.

                                     LOOMIS
                         I see.

                                     MARION
                              (defensively)
                         What does that mean?

                                     LOOMIS
                         It means... I see.

                                     MARION
                         You don't have to make this any 
                         harder than it already is.

                                     LOOMIS
                         I couldn't if I tried.

                                     MARION
                         The only thing that ever bothers 
                         me is their gibberish. When they 
                         start raving on and on...

                                     LOOMIS
                         You don't have anything to worry 
                         about. He hasn't spoken a word in 
                         15 years.

               Both of them suddenly stare out the windshield in front of 
               them.

               POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD -- FIELD

               Through the rain we see a field off to the side of the 
               road. Dimly lit by the car headlights are FIVE PATIENTS, 
               dressed in wind-blown white gowns, drenched by the rain, 
               wandering aimlessly around the field.

                         Since when do they let them wander 
                         around?

               They look up ahead.

               POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD -- PATIENT

               Standing by the side of the road is a MALE PATIENT, a wild-
               looking man in his sixties dressed in a white gown, who 
               stares at the station wagon.

               INT. STATION WAGON

               Marion slows the station wagon and pulls off to the side 
               of the road. Loomis jumps out.

               POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD -- LOOMIS AND PATIENT

               Through the windshield we see Loomis rush over to the 
               patient, stand and talk for a moment, then hurry back.

               INT. STATION WAGON

               Loomis climbs back in, dripping from the rain.

                                     LOOMIS
                         Pull up to the entrance!

                                     MARION
                         Shouldn't we pick him up?

                                     LOOMIS
                         Move it!

               Marion starts down the road.

                                     MARION
                         What did he say?

                                     LOOMIS
                         He asked me if I could help him 
                         find his purple lawn mower.

                                     MARION
                         I don't think this is any time to 
                         be funny...

                                     LOOMIS
                         He said something else. "It's all 
                         right now. He's gone. The evil's 
                         gone."

               POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD -- SANITARIUM DRIVE

               Ahead of them is the entrance to the sanitarium.

               INT. STATION WAGON

               Marion slows down to turn.

               Through the rear window we see a SHAPE spring up out of 
               the darkness, streak through the rain and leap up on the 
               rear of the station wagon.

               The station wagon bounces up and down. The roof sags in 
               and out with the weight of someone on top.

                                     MARION
                         Something fell on the roof.

               The roof continues to buckle in and out wildly.

                                     LOOMIS
                         Something jumped on the roof...

               Marion stops and rolls down her window to look outside.

               Loomis opens his door and steps out. Suddenly he is hit in 
               the face by a powerful fist from the roof. Loomis staggers 
               backwards and falls by the side of the road.

               Marion starts to react. Suddenly a hand reaches in through 
               the window and lunges at her.

               The fingers grab her hair. She SCREAMS. The fingers tighten 
               around her hair and the hand pulls Marion roughly to the 
               window.

               Twisted around in the seat, Marion's foot jams down all 
               the way on the gas pedal. The station wagon ROARS forward.

               Marion continues to SCREAM, clawing at the hand.

               POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD -- ROAD

               Through the rain the road spins crazily ahead, the wipers 
               erasing sheets of rain.

               Suddenly the other hand reaches down from the roof and 
               grabs the wiper, holding it tightly. Rain splashes on the 
               windshield obscuring the road.

               INT. STATION WAGON

               The hand rips at Marion's hair. SCREAMING. Clawing.

               POV THROUGH Windshield 

               The windshield is completely obliterated by rain.

               INT. STATION WAGON

               The station wagon skids and WHAMS into the shoulder on the 
               Side of the road. Marion is hurled across the seat against 
               the passenger door.

               Suddenly the hand springs down from above and SLAMS against 
               the passenger window, shattering it.

               SHRIEKING, Marion scurries across the front seat, opens 
               the driver's door and scrambles out.

               EXT. ROAD -- STATION WAGON

               Marion frantically crawls her way across the rain-drenched 
               road away from the station wagon. CAMERA TRACKS with her 
               as she slides down into the muddy shoulder. She looks back.

               POV -- STATION WAGON

               From the shoulder we see the station wagon in the rain, 
               and the shape jump in the driver's seat and SLAM the door.

               Then the station wagon takes off and disappears down the 
               road into the darkness.

               ANGLE ON SHOULDER

               Loomis runs up out of the rain and helps Marion to her 
               feet.  She CRIES hysterically. Loomis stares off down the 
               road at the disappearing taillights.

                                     LOOMIS
                         You can calm down. The evil's gone.

               EXT. LAURIE'S HOUSE -- DAY

               LAURIE, 17 and pretty in a quiet sort of way, steps out of 
               her two-story frame house, down the front walk to the 
               street. Her face has a soft, innocent quality, her eyes 
               bright and alive. Her FATHER steps out of the door behind 
               her and walks to the car in the driveway. His car has 
               "STRODE REAL ESTATE" emblazoned on the side door.

                                     FATHER
                         Don't forget to drop off the key 
                         at the Myers place...

                                     LAURIE
                         I won't.

                         They're coming by to see the house 
                         at 10:30. Be sure you leave it 
                         under the mat...

                                     LAURIE
                         I promise.

               TRACKING SHOT -- LAURIE

               CAMERA MOVES with Laurie as she walks down the residential 
               street. She carries a large bundle of schoolbooks in her 
               arms. Across a backyard TOMMY DOYLE, an eight-year-old boy 
               with tousled brown hair and bright blue eyes comes running 
               with his books.

                                     TOMMY
                         Hey, Laurie...

                         Hi, Tommy.

               He catches up with her and they walk along down the street.

                                     TOMMY
                         Are you coming over tonight?

                                     LAURIE
                         Same time, same place.

                                     TOMMY
                         Can we make Jack-o'-lanterns?

                                     LAURIE
                         Sure.

                                     TOMMY
                         Can we watch the monster movies?

                                     LAURIE
                         Sure.

                                     TOMMY
                         Will you read to me? Can we make 
                         popcorn?

                                     LAURIE
                         Sure. Sure.

               They walk up to the front of the old, two-story Myers house 
               set back from the street. It is now weather-beaten and 
               dilapidated. Laurie walks through the front gate and starts 
               up toward the porch.

                                     TOMMY
                         You're not supposed to go up there.

               Laurie holds up a key.

                                     LAURIE
                         Yes, I am.

                                     TOMMY
                         Uh-uh. That's a spook house.

                                     LAURIE
                         Just watch.

               Laurie strolls up to the front porch. She bends down, lifts 
               the welcome mat and places the key under it.

               INT. MYERS HOUSE -- THROUGH WINDOW

               Through a front window, we see Laurie bending over the 
               welcome mat. Suddenly a dark shape, the outline of a man, 
               leans forward, watching her. As she walks back to Tommy at 
               the street the shape moves to watch them, then fades back 
               into the interior of the house.

               TRACKING SHOT -- LAURIE AND TOMMY

               Laurie and Tommy continue walking down the street.

                                     TOMMY
                         Lonnie Elam said never to go up 
                         there. Lonnie Elam said that's a 
                         haunted house. He said real awful 
                         stuff happened there once.

                                     LAURIE
                         Lonnie Elam probably won't get out 
                         of sixth grade.

               Tommy breaks stride and runs across the street.

                                     TOMMY
                         I gotta go.  I'll see you tonight.

                                     LAURIE
                         See you.

               Laurie continues walking alone. She begins to sing quietly 
               to herself.

                                     LAURIE
                              (sings)
                         I wish I had you all alone...
                         Just the two of us...
                         I would hold you close to me...
                         So close to me...

               ANGLE DOWN STREET

               We see Laurie walking off down the street in the distance.  
               CLOSE TO CAMERA the dark shape moves into frame, watching 
               Laurie disappear around the corner.

               Sam Loomis strides quickly out of the front of the 
               sanitarium followed immediately by DR. WYNN, a gray-haired 
               man in his forties. CAMERA TRACKS with them across the 
               parking lot.

                                     WYNN
                         I'm not responsible, Sam.

                                     LOOMIS
                              (angrily)
                         Of course not.

                                     WYNN
                         I've given them his profile.

                                     LOOMIS
                         You must have told them we shocked 
                         him into a grinning idiot. Two 
                         roadblocks and an all-points 
                         bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year 
                         old!

               Loomis reaches a car and unlocks it.

                                     WYNN
                         He was your patient, Doctor. If 
                         the precautions weren't sufficient, 
                         you should have notified...

                                     LOOMIS
                         I notified everybody! Nobody 
                         listened.

                                     WYNN
                         There's nothing else I can do.

                                     LOOMIS
                         You can get back on the telephone 
                         and tell them exactly what walked 
                         out of here last night. And tell 
                         them where he's going.

                                     WYNN
                         Probably going.

                                     LOOMIS
                         I'm wasting time.

               Loomis gets in the car. Wynn leans down to the window.

                                     WYNN
                         Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and 
                         fifty miles from here. How could 
                         he get there, he can't drive?

                                     LOOMIS
                         He was doing all right last night.
                         Maybe somebody around here gave 
                         him lessons.

               Loomis starts up the car and pulls away from the sanitarium.

               Wynn watches him go, then hurries back into the building.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. CLASSROOM -- DAY

               Laurie sits at the back of a classroom of HIGH SCHOOL 
               STUDENTS. CAMERA MOVES IN on her as a TEACHER drones away 
               at the front of the room.

                                     TEACHER (V.O.)
                         ...and the book ends, but what 
                         Samuels is really talking about 
                         here is fate.

               CAMERA MOVES to a CLOSE-UP of Laurie. She barely listens 
               to the teacher as she doodles in her notebook in front of 
               her.

                                     TEACHER
                              (continuing)
                         You see, fate caught up with several 
                         lives here. No matter what course 
                         of action Rollins took, he was 
                         destined to his own fate, his own 
                         day of reckoning with himself.
                         The idea is that destiny is a very 
                         real, concrete thing that every . 
                         person has to deal with.

               Laurie lets her gaze move to a window. She stares dreamily 
               outside.

               LAURIE'S POV -- STREET

               From the window she can see the street, and a station wagon 
               parked along the sidewalk.

               Behind the station wagon stands the shape of a man. We 
               can't quite see his features from here, but it is clear 
               that he is looking in the school window.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She turns away from the window and begins to doodle again.

               ANGLE ON NOTEBOOK

               We see Laurie draw:

                                     LAURI STRODE 
                                     TEACHER (V.O.)
                              (continuing)
                         Edwin, how does Samuel's view of 
                         fate differ from that of Costaine?

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She glances up from the book and out the window again.

               LAURIE'S POV -- STREET

               The shape behind the station wagon is still there and 
               staring right at her.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She frowns, staring back at the shape.

                                     EDWIN (V.O.)
                         Uh... doesn't he feel that no matter 
                         how complicated something is, it's 
                         also really simple too?

                                     TEACHER (V.O.)
                         No.
                              (pause)
                         Laurie.

               This springs her around from the window.

                                     LAURIE
                         M'am?

                                     TEACHER (V.O.)
                         Answer the question.

                                     LAURIE
                         Costaine wrote that fate was somehow 
                         related only to religion, where 
                         Samuels felt that fate was like a 
                         natural element, like earth, air, 
                         fire and water.

                                     TEACHER (V.O.)
                         That's right, Samuels definitely 
                         personified fate...

               Laurie sneaks a glance back to the window.

               LAURIE'S POV -- STREET

               The shape and the station wagon are gone.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She turns back from the window and back to her notebook.

               ANGLE ON NOTEBOOK

               She has written:

                               "LAURIE STRODE IS LONELY"

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. GAS STATION -- HIGHWAY -- DAY

               We see a car parked in front of a small, closed-down gas 
               station/diner by the side of the highway. CAMERA SLOWLY 
               TRACKS over to a phone booth. Loomis is inside on the 
               telephone.

                                     LOOMIS
                              (into telephone)
                         No, not since Thursday.
                              (pause)
                         Yes, yes I'm all right. Stop 
                         worrying. After this I'll sleep 
                         for a week, two weeks...
                              (pause)
                         I said I'm all right. Believe me. 
                         I'll be home soon. Yes I do. Very 
                         much. I just... have to stop him...  
                         Of course it's possible, but I 
                         know him. And when he gets there, 
                         God help us.
                              (pause)
                         Right, right, I'll call you. Me 
                         too. Goodbye.

               Loomis hangs up the phone and steps out of the booth. He 
               looks up the highway.

               LOOMIS' POV -- HIGHWAY

               The highway disappears off into the distance. There is an 
               old weather-beaten sign that reads:

                                 HADDONFIELD 73 MILES

               Just above the horizon huge clusters of clouds, dark and 
               ominous, are blown along by the wind.

               EXT. GAS STATION

               Loomis turns and walks back to his car. He glances at the 
               old gas station as he walks.

               LOOMIS' POV -- GAS STATION -- MOVING SHOT

               The building is dark, empty, dilapidated. On the padlocked 
               door are huge marks like the clawing of an animal wanting 
               to get in.

               ANGLE ON LOOMIS

               Loomis stops, stares at the door and then slowly walks 
               over to it. He touches the marks with his hands, then looks 
               at the dirt driveway around the building.

               LOOMIS' POV -- DRIVEWAY

               There are definite tire tracks leading from the highway up 
               to the door, then back to the highway again.

               Then his gaze returns to a discarded object crushed in the 
               dirt of the driveway: a pack of cigarettes.

               ANGLE ON LOOMIS

               He picks up the cigarette pack.

               CLOSE SHOT -- CIGARETTE PACK

               Stuck in the cellophane of the crushed pack are matches:

               "The Rabbit in Red Lounge -- Entertainment Nightly."

               EXT. GAS STATION

               Loomis turns and quickly strides back to his car, gets in 
               and roars away from the lonely gas station.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. SCHOOLYARD -- DAY

               The playground is filled with CHILDREN just getting out of 
               school for the day. Some are dressed in Halloween costumes, 
               some carry pumpkins and orange and black streamers, some 
               carry Jack-o'-lanterns.

               Tommy Doyle comes out of the door carrying a very large 
               pumpkin. He is followed by 3 BOYS, RICHIE, KEITH and LONNIE, 
               who are LAUGHING and pushing him.

                                     TOMMY
                         Leave me alone!

                                     LONNIE
                         He's gonna get you!

               Lonnie runs up to Tommy and wiggles his fingers in Tommy's 
               face. The other boys form a circle around Tommy and taunt 
               him. In unison they sing:

                                     BOYS
                         He's gonna get you, he's gonna get 
                         you...

                                     LONNIE
                         The Boogeyman is coming!

                                     TOMMY
                         No he's not. Leave me alone.

                                     LONNIE
                         He doesn't believe us. Don't you 
                         know what happens on Halloween?

                                     TOMMY
                         Yeah, we get candy.

               The boys LAUGH. Richie runs up to Tommy and makes a face.

                                     RICHIE
                         Oooooo! The Boogeyman!

               The other boys join in the chant.

                                     BOYS
                              (in unison)
                         The Boogeyman, the Boogeyman, the 
                         Boogeyman...

               Tommy turns from them and starts to run away. Richie sticks 
               out his foot. Tommy trips and falls to the concrete, 
               SMASHING his pumpkin beneath him. The other boys run away 
               GIGGLING and SCREAMING with delight.

               PLAYGROUND ENTRANCE -- GATE

               As the boys race out of the playground, Richie barrels 
               through the gate and runs right into the dark shape.

               We don't see the shape's face, just his lower body. He is 
               dressed in pants and a shirt that look too big for him. He 
               grabs Richie and holds him back at arm's length.

               A large object falls out of his pocket. Richie quickly 
               stares down at it. The shape lifts his foot and SMACKS it 
               down over the object to hide it. Quickly Richie and the 
               other 2 boys run around the man and on down the block.

               The shape lifts his foot. Underneath it is a large butcher 
               knife. He quickly picks it up and shoves it into his pocket.

               Slowly the shape turns and walks away from the playground 
               gate, CAMERA TRACKING WITH HIM. Across from him in the 
               playground we see Tommy get to his feet, wiping the 
               demolished pumpkin off his shirt and pants.

               We TRACK WITH THE shape to a station wagon. On the side of 
               the door is a state emblem.

               INT. STATION WAGON

               The shape gets in the station wagon. We still don't see 
               his face. Separating the front and back seats is the wire-
               mesh screen. It is Loomis' vehicle. The shape starts the 
               engine. He pulls away from the curb.

               POV FROM WINDOW

               Slowly the station wagon moves down the street. We see 
               Tommy hurrying along the sidewalk, still rubbing off the 
               pumpkin splatter. Tommy turns off the sidewalk and cuts up 
               a side alley.

               The wagon picks up speed and continues on down the street.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY

               Laurie and LYNDA stroll down the front steps of the high 
               school and turn up the street. Laurie carries another large 
               stack of books. Lynda is a knockout in tight jeans and 
               tight T-shirt. She carries no books. CAMERA TRACKS WITH 
               THEM up the street.

                                     LYNDA
                         It's totally insane!  We have three 
                         new cheers to learn in the morning, 
                         the game in the afternoon, I get 
                         my hair done at five, and the dance 
                         is at eight. I'll be totally wiped 
                         out!

                                     LAURIE
                         I think you have too much to do 
                         tomorrow.

                                     LYNDA
                         Totally!

                                     LAURIE
                         As usual, I don't have anything to 
                         do.

                                     LYNDA
                         It's your own fault and I don't 
                         feel sorry for you.

               ANNIE comes out of the side doors of the high school and 
               calls after Laurie and Lynda.

                                     ANNIE
                         Hey, Lynda, Laurie!

               The girls stop and wait for Annie.

                                     ANNIE
                              (continuing)
                         Why didn't you wait for me?

                                     LYNDA
                         We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally 
                         never showed up.

                                     ANNIE
                         That's not true. Here I am.

                                     LAURIE
                         What's wrong, Annie? You're not 
                         smiling.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm never smiling again. Paul 
                         dragged me into the boy's locker 
                         room to tell me...

                         Exploring uncharted territory?

                         It's been totally charted.

                         We just talked.

                         Old jerko got caught throwing eggs 
                         and soaping windows. His parents 
                         grounded him for the weekend. He 
                         can't come over tonight.

                                     LAURIE
                         I thought you were baby-sitting 
                         tonight.

                                     LYNDA
                         The only reason she baby-sits is 
                         to have a place to...

               Laurie suddenly stops and turns back toward the school.

                                     LAURIE
                         Shit!

                              (indignant)
                         I have a place for that.

                                     LAURIE
                         I forgot my chemistry book.

                         Who cares? I always forget my 
                         chemistry book.

               Laurie glances down the street.

               LAURIE'S POV -- STATION WAGON

               The station wagon slowly moves up the street toward them. 
               The shape isn't visible behind the windshield.

                         cute.

                                     LAURIE
                         don't think so...I

               Laurie stares at the station wagon as it moves past. She 
               looks directly at the shape inside. There is a quick glimpse 
               of him, a strange pale face staring back.

               INT. STATION WAGON

               The shape is close to CAMERA, out of focus. Out the window 
               we see the three girls on the sidewalk.

               The shape stares at Laurie looking back at him, then tromps 
               on the accelerator. The wagon whizzes past them.

               POV -- STATION WAGON

               Up the street the wagon suddenly stops. It sits there, 
               waiting.

               POV -- STATION WAGON

               For a moment the station wagon just sits there. Then it 
               takes off down the street and disappears around a corner.

                         Annie, some day you're going to 
                         get all of us in deep trouble.

                         I hate a guy with a car and no 
                         sense of humor.

               The girls start walking again. Laurie is quiet, puzzled by 
               the appearance of the man in the car.

                                     LYNDA
                         Well, are we still on for tonight?

                              (coldly)
                         I wouldn't want to get you in deep 
                         trouble, Lynda.

                         Come on, Annie. Bob and I have 
                         been planning on it all week.

                                     ANNIE
                         All right. The Wallaces leave at 
                         seven.

                         I'm baby-sitting for the Doyles.  
                         It's only three houses away. We 
                         can keep each other company.

                                     ANNIE
                         Terrific. I've got three choices.

               Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw or talk to you.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET -- DAY

               The three girls stop in front of Lynda's house, a modest 
               suburban home on a quiet, tree-lined street.

                                     ANNIE
                         What time?

                         I don't know yet. I have to get 
                         out of taking my stupid brother 
                         trick or treating.

                         Fun-ny. See you.

               Lynda strolls up to her house. Annie and Laurie start down 
               the street. CAMERA MOVES IN to a CLOSE SHOT of Laurie's 
               face. She stares ahead along the sidewalk.

               LAURIE'S POV -- MOVING SHOT -- BUSHES

               Up the sidewalk is a series of bushes lining the street.  
               There, partially hidden in the shadows of a bush, is the 
               shape of a man, watching them. He is barely visible, almost 
               blending in with the dark foliage.

               The shape is gone. Just bushes.

                         I don't see anything.

                                     LAURIE
                         That man who drove by so fast, the 
                         one you yelled at.

                                     ANNIE
                         Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!

               Annie walks right over to the bushes and kicks them hard.

               Nothing happens.

                                     ANNIE
                              (continuing)
                         Laurie, my dear, he wants to talk 
                         to you.

               Laurie just stands on the sidewalk several feet from the 
               bushes.

                                     ANNIE
                              (continuing)
                         He wants to take you out tonight.

               Slowly Laurie walks over and stares at the bush.

                                     LAURIE
                         He was standing right here.

                                     ANNIE
                         Poor Laurie. You scared another 
                         one away.

                                     LAURIE
                         Cute.

               They start walking down the sidewalk again.

                                     ANNIE
                         It's tragic. You never go out.

               You must have a small fortune stashed from baby-sitting so 
               much.

                                     LAURIE
                         The guys think I'm too smart.

               Laurie glances back at the bushes behind them.

                                     ANNIE
                         I don't. I think you're whacko.

               You're seeing men behind bushes.

               The two girls stop in front of Annie's house, another small 
               suburban home.

                                     ANNIE
                              (continuing)
                         Well, home sweet home. I'll see 
                         you later.

                                     LAURIE
                         Okay. Bye.

               Annie walks up to her door.

               For a moment Laurie looks around cautiously before starting 
               down the sidewalk again, CAMERA TRACKING WITH HER. A strong 
               wind rises and blows her hair in front of her face. Again 
               she turns around and glances back down the street.

               LAURIE'S POV -- BUSHES

               There is still nothing there.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               Suddenly, Laurie walks right into a man standing on the 
               sidewalk in front of her. She SCREAMS and drops her books.

               It is LEE BRACKETT, Annie's father. He is a tall man in a 
               county sheriff's uniform. He quickly bends down and picks 
               up her books.

                                     BRACKETT
                         Excuse me, Laurie.

                                     LAURIE
                         Mister Brackett...

                                     BRACKETT
                         Didn't mean to startle you.

                                     LAURIE
                         It's okay...

                                     BRACKETT
                         Well, it's Halloween. I guess 
                         everybody's entitled to a good 
                         scare.

                                     LAURIE
                         Yes, sir. Nice seeing you.

               Brackett walks down the sidewalk to his house. Laurie 
               bundles her books and hurries up the street.

               EXT. LAURIE'S HOUSE -- DAY

               Laurie walks up on the front porch of her house. She pauses 
               a moment and glances down the street.

               LAURIE'S POV -- TRICK-OR-TREATERS

               Several CHILDREN in costumes are going door to door 
               collecting their treats.

                         Well, kiddo, I thought you outgrew 
                         superstition.

               INT. LAURIE'S HOUSE -- DAY

               Laurie strolls through the living room. Through the doorway 
               into the kitchen we see LAURIE'S MOTHER busy making candied 
               apples.

                                     LAURIE
                         Hi, Mom, I'm home.

                         Laurie, Annie just called. She 
                         said call her back.Laurie turns 
                         and hurries up the stairs.

                                     LAURIE
                         Thanks, mom.

               INT. LAURIE'S ROOM

               Laurie walks into her bedroom. She tosses her books on the 
               bed and starts to her telephone.The wind blows her curtains 
               through the open window. Laurie crosses to the window and 
               leans up to close it.

               LAURIE'S POV -- BACKYARD

               From her room in the second story, Laurie can see into the 
               backyard next door.

               There is a clothesline with sheets blowing in the wind. In 
               between the sheets we glimpse the shape standing there, 
               looking up at Laurie.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She freezes and stares down fearfully.

               LAURIE'S POV -- BACKYARD

               The sheets continue to twist and turn in the wind, but now 
               the shape is gone.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               Laurie SLAMS the window and locks it. She slowly walks to 
               the middle of her room and stands there for several moments, 
               unsure as to whether she has actually seen it.

               Suddenly, the phone RINGS, loud and shrill, startling 
               Laurie.

               She answers it.

                                     LAURIE
                         Hello.

               Silence.

                                     LAURIE
                              (continuing)
                         Hello?

               There is a SOUND from the receiver, like chewing...

                                     LAURIE
                              (continuing)
                         Who is this?

               The chewing continues. She slams the receiver down.

               Almost immediately, the phone RINGS again. Laurie looks at 
               it. It rings again. She picks it up.

                                     LAURIE
                         Hello?

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         Why did you hang up on me?

                                     LAURIE
                         Annie, was that you?

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         Of course.

                                     LAURIE
                         Why didn't you say anything? You 
                         scared me to death.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         I had my mouth full. Couldn't you 
                         hear me?

                                     LAURIE
                         I thought it was an obscene phone 
                         call.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         Now you hear obscene chewing.
                         You're losing it, Laurie.

                                     LAURIE
                         I've already lost it.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         I doubt that. Listen, my mother is 
                         letting me use her car. I'll pick 
                         you up. 6:30.

                                     LAURIE
                         Sure, see you later.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         Bye.

               Laurie hangs up.

                                     LAURIE
                              (to herself)
                         Calm down. This is ridiculous.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. GRAVEYARD -- DAY

               WIDE SHOT of an old graveyard on a windy hillside. CAMERA 
               BOOMS DOWN as a car pulls up on the small road in f.g. Sam 
               Loomis gets out, along with TAYLOR, the graveyard owner.  
               Taylor is a small, officious man in his late sixties. He 
               glances at a small notepad.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Let's see. Myers. Judith Myers. 
                         Row 18, plot 20. Over this way.

               The two men begin walking along through the graveyard, 
               winding around headstones and flowers.

                                     TAYLOR
                              (continuing)
                         Every town has something like this 
                         happen. I remember a guy over is 
                         Russellville. Charley Bowles. About 
                         fifteen years ago, he finished 
                         dinner, excused himself from the 
                         table, went out into the garage 
                         and got a hacksaw, then came back 
                         into the house, kissed his wife 
                         and two children goodbye, and then 
                         proceeded to...

                                     LOOMIS
                         Where are we?

                                     TAYLOR
                         Just right over there a ways. And 
                         I remember Judith Myers. Just 
                         couldn't believe it. A young boy 
                         like that...

               Taylor stops cold.

                                     LOOMIS
                         Lost?

                                     TAYLOR
                              (sadly)
                         Why do they do it?

               He points to a plot right in front of them. Loomis stares.

               The headstone is missing, uprooted from the ground.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Goddamn kids.  They'll do anything 
                         on Halloween.

                                     LOOMIS
                         Whose grave is it?

               Taylor checks his notebook, then counts the rows and plots.

                                     TAYLOR
                         18, 20... Judith Myers...

               Taylor gives Loomis a quizzical look. Loomis shakes his 
               head and looks out across the graveyard.

                                     LOOMIS
                         He came home...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. LAURIE'S HOUSE -- DUSK

               CAMERA BEGINS on the trees that line the residential street, 
               twisting and writhing in the dusk wind. SLOWLY CAMERA BOOMS 
               DOWN to Laurie waiting outside her house by the street. 
               She carries a tote bag with schoolbooks and knitting needles 
               stuck inside, and a large pumpkin. The sun is a pale glow 
               behind the trees.

               Laurie turns her gaze down the street

               LAURIE'S POV -- TRICK-OR-TREATERS

               More CHILDREN in costumes walk from house to house, some 
               with MOTHERS and SISTERS, trick or treating. The wind blows 
               their costumes, billowing them outward.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She watches the trick-or-treaters as a car swings around 
               the corner and pulls up in front of her. It is Annie.

                                     ANNIE
                         Hurry up.

               Laurie walks around to the passenger door and gets in.

               INT. ANNIE'S CAR -- DUSK

               Annie pulls away from the curb and hands Laurie a joint.

                                     ANNIE
                         We just have time.

               Laurie lights the joint and puffs vigorously.

                                     ANNIE
                              (continuing)
                         You still spooked?

                                     LAURIE
                         I wasn't spooked.

                                     ANNIE
                         Lies.

                                     LAURIE
                         I saw someone standing in Mr.
                         Riddle's backyard.

                                     ANNIE
                         Probably Mister Riddle.

                                     LAURIE
                         He was watching me.

                                     ANNIE
                         Mister Riddle was watching you?
                         Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-
                         seven.

                                     LAURIE
                         He can still watch.

                                     ANNIE
                         That's probably all he can do.

               Behind them through the rear-view mirror, we see Loomis' 
               station wagon pull out of an alley and follow along.

                                     ANNIE
                              (continuing)
                         What's the pumpkin for?

                                     LAURIE
                         I brought it for Tommy. I figured 
                         making a Jack-o'-lantern would 
                         keep him occupied.

                                     ANNIE
                         I always said you'd make a fabulous 
                         girl scout.

                                     LAURIE
                         Thanks.

                                     ANNIE
                         For that matter, I might as well 
                         be a girl scout tonight. I plan on 
                         making popcorn and watching Doctor 
                         Dementia.
                              (cont'd)
                         Six straight hours of horror movies. 
                         Little Lindsey Wallace won't know 
                         what hit her.

               EXT. HADDONFIELD SQUARE -- DUSK

               Annie's car drives through the main square of Haddonfield. 
               Following behind is the station wagon.

               INT. ANNIE'S CAR

               Annie points up ahead and quickly hides the joint.

                                     ANNIE
                         My dad!

               POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD

               Two police cars are parked in the street in front of Nichols 
               Hardware Store. An ALARM BELL inside the store CLANGS 
               SHRILLY.

               INT. ANNIE'S CAR

               They quickly roll down the windows and begin wildly clearing 
               out the marijuana smoke. Behind them the station wagon 
               disappears off down a side street.

               ANGLE ON POLICE CARS

               Annie's car stops at the police cars. Lee Brackett strolls 
               out to the car and leans down to the window.

                                     BRACKETT
                         Hi, Annie, Laurie...

                                     ANNIE
                         Hi, Dad. What happened?

                                     BRACKETT
                              (strains to hear 
                              over the alarm)
                         What?

                                     ANNIE
                         What happened?

                                     BRACKETT
                         Someone broke in the hardware store. 
                         Probably kids.

                                     ANNIE
                         You blame everything on kids.

                                     BRACKETT
                         The only things missing were some 
                         Halloween masks, rope, a set of 
                         knives. What does that sound like 
                         to you?

               Annie turns to Laurie.

                                     ANNIE
                         It's hard growing up with a cynical 
                         father.

               Behind Brackett, Sam Loomis walks up the street. We see 
               Loomis talk to a COP who points to Brackett.

                                     BRACKETT
                         You're going to be late at the 
                         Doyle's, Annie.

                                     ANNIE
                              (unable to hear 
                              over the alarm)
                         Huh?

               Just as Brackett is about to speak the alarm goes off.

                                     BRACKETT
                              (shouts)
                         You're going to be late!

                                     ANNIE
                              (to Laurie)
                         He shouts, too.

               Brackett smiles as Loomis walks up behind him.

                                     BRACKETT
                         Goodbye, girls.

                                     ANNIE & LAURIE
                         Bye.

               Annie's car pulls away.

                                     LOOMIS
                         Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.

                                     BRACKETT
                         Lee Brackett.

               As they talk CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES AROUND THEM to a view of 
               the street.

                                     LOOMIS
                         I'd like to talk with you, if I 
                         could.

                                     BRACKETT
                         May be a few minutes. I gotta stick 
                         around here...

                                     LOOMIS
                         It's important.

               Loomis' station wagon moves by behind them. Loomis doesn't 
               see it.

                                     BRACKETT
                         Ten minutes.

                                     LOOMIS
                         I'll be there.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. MOON -- NIGHT

               Through the blowing trees we see the full moon rising in 
               the night sky. There are SOUNDS of wind and CHIRPING 
               CRICKETS.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET -- NIGHT

               Annie's car moves down a quiet little residential street 
               and pulls up in front of a two-story house set back from 
               the street: the Doyle house.

               ANGLE FROM STATION WAGON

               We are in the front seat of the station wagon. Through the 
               windshield we see Laurie get out of Annie's car, say goodbye 
               and walk up to the Doyle's house.

               Then Annie's car makes a wide U-turn in the street and 
               starts down the other direction. The station wagon pulls 
               forward and follows her.

               Annie stops three houses down the street and pulls into a 
               garage. The station wagon stops several feet away.

               We see Annie come out of the garage and walk to another 
               two-story frame house: the Wallace's.

               TRACKING SHOT BEHIND SHAPE

               The shape gets out of the station wagon, close to CAMERA 
               so we can't see him. He glances down the street. Gusts of 
               wind blow the costumes of children going from house to 
               house.

               The shape moves. CAMERA TRACKS behind him as he walks toward 
               the Wallace house.

               The shape stops in front. Through the front room windows 
               we can see Annie talking to the WALLACES as they put on 
               their coats.

               The front door opens. CAMERA and shape quickly move behind 
               a tree to hide from sight.

               The Wallaces step out of their house and walk to the garage.  
               Annie and LINDSEY WALLACE, a pretty little nine-year-old, 
               stand in the doorway framed by the hall light. Out of the 
               garage comes the Wallace's car. It turns and disappears 
               down the street.

               Annie closes the door. The shape steps out from behind the 
               tree and stares at the house.

               ANGLE ON WINDOW

               The shape moves to see inside a window of the Wallace house.

               Inside, we see Annie turn on the TV. She goes to a mirror 
               on the wall and begins to brush her hair.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. MYERS HOUSE -- NIGHT

               A police car pulls up in front of the Myers house. Brackett 
               and Loomis get out and stand by the front gate.

                                     LOOMIS
                         Anybody live here?

                                     BRACKETT
                         Not since 1963, since it happened.
                         Every kid in Haddonfield thinks 
                         this place is haunted.

                                     LOOMIS
                         They may be right.

               ANGLE DOWN SIDE OF HOUSE

               Looking down the side of the house we see Loomis and 
               Brackett walk up to the front porch. A broken, rusted rain 
               gutter CLANGS back and forth against the house in the wind.

               INT. MYERS HOUSE -- NIGHT

               The front door slowly opens. Brackett and Loomis stand in 
               the doorway. They glance at each other. Brackett draws his 
               gun and the two men step inside.

               It is totally dark in the house. Brackett's flashlight 
               comes on, illuminating the two men. As they move through 
               the house CAMERA TRACKS with them.

               Suddenly Brackett stops. He trains his flashlight on a small 
               object in the corner of the room.

                                     LOOMIS
                         What is it?

               For a moment Brackett doesn't speak. Then he steps closer 
               to the object.

                                     BRACKETT
                         A dog...

               Both men look down off screen at the animal. Brackett bends 
               down to it.

                                     BRACKETT
                              (continuing)
                         Still warm.

               He stands back up and looks at Loomis.

                                     LOOMIS
                         He got hungry.

               Brackett gets a disgusted expression and steps away.

                                     BRACKETT
                         Come on... A skunk could have killed 
                         it...

                                     LOOMIS
                         Could have...

               Brackett looks back at the dead animal.

                                     BRACKETT
                         A man wouldn't do that...

                                     LOOMIS
                         He isn't a man.

               INT. MYERS BEDROOM

               Loomis and Brackett cautiously step into the bedroom, the 
               same room where the murder took place fifteen years ago.  
               The glow from a distant streetlight casts the shadows of 
               blowing trees on the walls.

                                     LOOMIS
                         It happened in here.

               Loomis walks over to the spot where the sister was sitting.

                                     LOOMIS
                              (continuing)
                         She was sitting here when he came 
                         through the door.

               Loomis turns and glances at the window. He slowly walks 
               toward it.

                                     LOOMIS
                              (continuing)
                         He must have watched them through 
                         this window...

               LOOMIS' POV -- WINDOW

               CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS IN toward the window.

               ANGLE ON LOOMIS

               Loomis stops by the window.

                                     LOOMIS
                              (continuing)
                         Standing just outside, he could . 
                         peer over the sill...

               Blown loose by the wind, the rain gutter suddenly swings 
               down and SMASHES through the window with a THUNDERING CRASH 
               of broken glass.

               Loomis jumps back, reaches into his coat pocket and draws 
               a .357 magnum revolver.

               Brackett stares at him. Loomis sees Brackett's reaction 
               and slowly reholsters the revolver.

                                     LOOMIS
                              (continuing, looks 
                              at Brackett)
                         I suppose I do seem a bit sinister 
                         for a doctor.

                                     BRACKETT
                         Looks like to me you're just plain 
                         scared.

                                     LOOMIS
                         I am.
                              (he glances around 
                              the bedroom)
                         I met him fifteen years ago. I was 
                         told there was nothing left, no 
                         conscience, no reason, no 
                         understanding, in even the most 
                         rudimentary sense, of life or death 
                         or right or wrong. I met this six-
                         year-old boy with a blank, cold 
                         emotionless face and the blackest 
                         of eyes, the devil's eyes. I spent 
                         eight years trying to reach him 
                         and another seven trying to keep 
                         him locked away when I realized 
                         what was living behind that boy's 
                         eyes was purely, simply evil.

               Brackett just looks at him a moment.

                                     BRACKETT
                         What do we do?

                                     LOOMIS
                         He was here, earlier tonight, and 
                         he may be coming back. I'm going 
                         to wait for him.

                                     BRACKETT
                         I keep thinking I should call the 
                         radio and TV stations...

                                     LOOMIS
                         If you do they'll be seeing him 
                         everywhere, on every street corner, 
                         in every house. Just tell your men 
                         to shut their mouths and open their 
                         eyes.

                                     BRACKETT
                         I'll check back in an hour.

               Brackett turns and walks out of the bedroom. For a moment 
               Loomis stares at the rain gutter in the broken window.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. DOYLE HOUSE -- NIGHT

               CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS through the Doyle house. It is a large 
               home with a staircase that leads to the bedrooms upstairs. 
               Through a doorway we see a very modern kitchen. There is a 
               dining room and living room with a big bay window that 
               looks out into the street.

               Laurie sits with Tommy Doyle on the couch reading him a 
               story. Tommy has his Halloween costume on and a big bag of 
               candy on the floor.

                                     LAURIE
                              (reads)
                         ..."How now, cried Arthur. 'Then 
                         no one may pass this way without a 
                         fight?'  'That is so,' answered 
                         the knight in a bold and haughty 
                         manner..."

                                     TOMMY
                         I don't like that story.

                                     LAURIE
                         But King Arthur was always your 
                         favorite.

               Tommy pulls out a stack of comic books from underneath the 
               couch.

                                     TOMMY
                         Not any more.

                                     LAURIE
                         Why are they under there?

                                     TOMMY
                         Mom doesn't like me to have them.

               Laurie glances through the stack of comic books.

                                     LAURIE
                         'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I 
                         can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...

                                     TOMMY
                         Laurie, what's the Boogeyman?

               The phone RINGS in the other room. Laurie goes to answer 
               it.

               She picks up the receiver in the den.

                                     LAURIE
                         Hello.

               INT. DOYLE KITCHEN

               Annie stands making popcorn, the phone at her ear.

                                     ANNIE
                         Having fun? Never mind, I'm sure 
                         you are. I have big, big news for 
                         you...

               Lester, a large ferocious-looking German shepherd, trots 
               happily into the kitchen, spies Annie and walks over to 
               her.

               He nudges her legs with his head.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oops! Hold on a minute...

               She turns and reaches for Lester uncertainly.

                         Hi Lester...

               Lester GROWLS at her menacingly.

                                     ANNIE
                         Lindsey, Lindsey!
                              (into phone)
                         I'm about to be ripped apart by 
                         the family dog.

               Lindsey trots into the room.

                                     ANNIE
                         Get him out of here!

                                     LINDSEY
                         Here, Lester.

               Immediately Lester walks over to the back door. Lindsey 
               opens the door and the dog trots out. Then Lindsey closes 
               the back door and walks back into the living room.

                                     ANNIE
                              (into phone)
                         I hate that dog. I'm the only person 
                         in the world he doesn't like.

                                     LAURIE (V.O.)
                              (into phone)
                         What's this big, big news?

                                     ANNIE
                         What would you say if I told you 
                         that you were going to the 
                         Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?

               INTERCUT WITH LAURIE IN THE DEN

                                     LAURIE
                         I'd say you must have the wrong 
                         number.

                                     ANNIE
                         Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer 
                         and he got real excited when I 
                         told him how attracted you were to 
                         him.

                                     LAURIE
                         Annie you didn't. Tell me you 
                         didn't.

                                     ANNIE
                         You guys will make a fabulous 
                         couple.

               INT. DOYLE LIVING ROOM

               Tommy walks to the front window and looks out.

               TOMMY'S POV -- STREET

               A couple TRICK-OR-TREATERS walk by.

               Behind them, across the street, stands the shape, looking 
               into the house.

               EXT. STREET -- DOYLE HOUSE

               CAMERA is behind the shape, looking into the Doyle house. 
               We can see Laurie talking on the phone. The shape's head 
               moves slightly and WE PAN to see Tommy at the front room 
               window looking out. Tommy moves away from the window. PAN 
               BACK to see him enter the den and pull on Laurie's blouse.

                              (into phone)
                         I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't 
                         face him...

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         You'll have to. He's calling you 
                         tomorrow to find out what time to 
                         pick you up.

                                     LAURIE
                              (panicked)
                         Annie!

                                     TOMMY
                         Laurie, the Boogeyman is outside.
                         Look!

               Tommy runs to the window in the den and points. Laurie 
               walks over with the phone and looks.

               LAURIE'S POV -- STREET

               The street is empty.

                              (into phone)
                         Hold on.
                              (to Tommy)
                         There's nobody there, Tommy. Go 
                         watch some TV.

               Tommy runs out of the den.

               INT. DOYLE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

               Tommy dashes up to the front window and looks out.

               POV -- STREET

               We SEE the man as he passes under a streetlight on his way 
               toward the Wallace house.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. WALLACE HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Annie stands by the kitchen stove making popcorn..

                                     ANNIE
                              (into telephone)
                         Look, it's simple. You like him, 
                         he likes you. All you need is a 
                         little push.

               POV FROM OUTSIDE KITCHEN WINDOW

               The shape stands close to CAMERA watching Annie make 
               popcorn.

               She puts the butter in the pan.

                                     ANNIE
                              (continuing)
                         It won't hurt you to go out with 
                         him, for God's sake.

               Annie starts to pour the butter over the popcorn but instead 
               pours it on herself.

                                     ANNIE
                              (continuing)
                         Shit! No, no, I gotta call you 
                         back. I just made a mess of myself. 
                         Nothing unusual.

               Annie hangs up. She quickly takes off her blouse and blue 
               jeans. She stands in the kitchen with only her panties on.

               She pulls a box of cornstarch out of the closet and 
               sprinkles it out on the stains of butter.

               ANGLE ON SIDE OF HOUSE

               The shape moves closer to the kitchen window and knocks 
               over a potted plant. It CRASHES noisily against the side 
               of the house..

               INT. WALLACE HOUSE

               Annie is startled by the crash. She looks outside the 
               window.

               POV OUT KITCHEN WINDOW

               A hanging plant swings in the wind. It BUMPS against the 
               side of the house.

               ANGLE OF ANNIE

               She turns from the window and walks out of the kitchen.

               EXT. WALLACE HOUSE

               The hanging plant continues to WHAP against the house.  A 
               hand suddenly stops its motion. The shape leans up close 
               to the kitchen window, looking inside.

               ANGLE ON DOG

               From the darkness of the backyard Lester springs forward 
               into CAMERA, SNARLING and BARKING viciously.1

               ANGLE ON SHAPE -- DOG

               The shape darts away from the kitchen window, the dog 
               SNAPPING right after him.

               INT.  WALLACE HOUSE

               Annie listens to the GROWLING of the dog. She turns to 
               Lindsey in the living room.

                                     ANNIE
                         Lindsey, Lester's barking again 
                         and getting on my nerves again...

                                     LINDSEY (O.S.)
                         No he's not.

               Suddenly the GROWLING sounds abruptly stop.

                                     ANNIE
                         Never mind. He found a hot date.

               Annie turns and walks into the living room.

               EXT. WALLACE HOUSE

               We SEE the shape's legs a few feet from the house. Next to 
               him are Lester's legs, kicking and struggling a few feet 
               above the ground.

               Off screen, the shape is strangling the dog in mid-air.

               Finally the dog's legs stop moving and dangle lifelessly.  
               The shape moves away from the house.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               Laurie and Tommy are sitting on the couch watching the 
               Horrorthon on TV.

                         What about the Jack-o'-lantern?

                         What about the rest of my comic 
                         books?

                              (quietly)
                         What about the Boogeyman?

                                     LAURIE
                         There's no such thing.

                                     TOMMY
                         Richie said he was coming after me 
                         tonight.

                                     LAURIE
                         Do you believe everything that 
                         Richie tells you?

                                     TOMMY
                         No...

                         Tommy, Halloween night is when you 
                         play tricks on people and scare 
                         them. It's all make believe.

               Richie was trying to scare you.

                                     TOMMY
                         I saw the Boogeyman. I saw him 
                         outside.

                                     LAURIE
                         There was no one out there.

                                     TOMMY
                         There was.

                                     LAURIE
                         What did he look like?

                                     TOMMY
                         The Boogeyman!

                                     LAURIE
                         We're not getting anywhere. All 
                         right, look, Tommy. The Boogeyman 
                         can only come out on Halloween 
                         night, right?

                                     TOMMY
                         Right.

                                     LAURIE
                         And I'm here tonight and I won't 
                         let him get you.

                                     TOMMY
                         Promise?

                                     LAURIE
                         I promise.

                                     TOMMY
                         Can we make the Jack-o'-lantern 
                         now?

               Laurie holds out her hand. Tommy takes it and together 
               they walk into the kitchen.

               EXT. PASSAGEWAY TO LAUNDRY -- WALLACE HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Annie walks through the passageway to the laundry room. 
               She is wearing a nylon robe and carrying her clothes to be 
               washed.  The wind blows the robe open.

               ANOTHER ANGLE -- PASSAGEWAY

               The shape stands behind a tree watching Annie walk along 
               the passageway.

               INT. LAUNDRY ROOM

               Annie walks into the dark laundry room.

               Almost immediately the wind blows the door shut!

               Annie stands motionless for a moment, then begins looking 
               for the light switch.

                                     ANNIE
                         Terrific!

               ANGLE ON DOOR

               The door creaks open. Behind the door we see the outline 
               of the shape standing there.

               ANGLE ON ANNIE

               Annie turns toward the slightly opened door.

                                     ANNIE
                         Hello?

               Silence.

                                     ANNIE
                         (continuing)
                         Who's there?

               Silence.  The wind blows the door open a little wider. In 
               the light from the main house, Annie sees the light switch. 
               Quickly she flicks on the switch and the laundry room lights 
               up. She glances outside the door.

               There is no one there.

                                     ANNIE
                         Paul, is this one of your cheap 
                         tricks?
                              (Pause, disappointed)
                         I guess not.

               She steps back inside and crosses to the washing machine. 
               She opens the top and dumps her clothes inside.

                                     ANNIE
                         No tricks for Annie tonight.

               Suddenly a big gust of wind comes through the opened window 
               above her. The door slams shut!

               Annie hurries to the door and tries to open it. It won't 
               open.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ANNIE

               She tries to pull the door open. Behind her, in the open 
               window above the washing machine, we see the shape looking 
               in.

                                     ANNIE
                         Lindsey! Lindsey, come out here!

               INT. WALLACE HOUSE

               LINDSEY WALLACE, 8 years old with a pretty face, watches 
               the Horror Marathon at top volume on TV. She doesn't hear 
               Annie's call.

               INT. LAUNDRY ROOM

                                     ANNIE
                         Lindsey, I'm in the laundry room!

               The door is stuck!

               Annie turns and glances at the window above the washing 
               machine. The shape is gone.

               She quickly crosses to the washing machine, climbs up on 
               top of it and starts out the window. Half way through she 
               gets stuck. She tries to squirm her way back in but it's 
               hopeless.

                                     ANNIE
                         Lindsey! Lindsey, goddamn it, help!

               From the house Annie hears the phone ring.

                                     ANNIE
                              (continuing)
                         Lindsey, answer the phone! It's 
                         Paul! Lindsey! LINDSEY!

               INT. WALLACE HOUSE

               Lindsey still sits in front of the TV. She lets the phone 
               ring away. Finally she gets up and walks to the phone, her 
               eyes pivoted on the TV. She picks up the receiver.

                                     LOOMIS
                         HELLO.

                                     PAUL (V.O.)
                         Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie 
                         there?

                                     LINDSEY
                         Yes, she is.

                                     PAUL (V.O.)
                         Will you get her for me.

                                     LINDSEY
                         She's washing her clothes.

                                     PAUL (V.O.)
                         Well, go tell her its me, okay?

                                     LINDSEY
                         Okay.

               Lindsey hangs up the phone and walks through the kitchen 
               to the back door. She calls from the door.

                                     LINDSEY
                         Annie, Paul's on the phone!

               115 ANGLE ON ANNIE HANGING OUTSIDE THE WINDOW 115

                                     ANNIE
                         Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked 
                         in the laundry room!

               EXT. LAUNDRY ROOM

               Lindsey crosses to the laundry room door. It is bolted 
               from the outside. She lifts the bolt and looks inside the 
               room.

               INT. LAUNDRY ROOM

                                     LINDSEY
                         You locked yourself in.

                                     ANNIE
                         I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.

               Lindsey pulls on Annie's legs and she slides from the window 
               onto the dryer.

                                     ANNIE
                         Lindsey, promise you won't tell 
                         anyone!

               INT. WALLACE HOUSE

               As Annie and Lindsey walk back inside the house, the phone 
               rings. Lindsey races across the room and picks it up.

                                     LINDSEY
                         She was stuck in the window, she'll 
                         be right here.

               Lindsey sets down the receiver and walks out of the kitchen.

               Annie gives Lindsey a dirty look and picks it up.

                                     ANNIE
                         Hello, Paul.
                              (pause)
                         All right, cut it out. It can happen 
                         to anyone.
                              (pause)
                         Yeah, but I've seen you stuck in 
                         other positions!

               Suddenly behind Annie the shape walks through the hallway 
               between the living room and the kitchen. She doesn't see 
               it.

                                     ANNIE
                              (continuing)
                         That's fantastic! When did they 
                         leave?
                              (pause)
                         Utterly fabulous!  So why don't 
                         you just walk over?
                              (pause)
                         My clothes are in the wash. I can't 
                         come now.
                              (pause)
                         Shut up, jerk. I've got a robe on.  
                         That's all you think about.
                              (pause)
                         That's not true. I think about 
                         lots of things. Why don't we not 
                         stand here talking about and get 
                         down to doing them? All right, see 
                         you in a few minutes.

               Annie hangs up the phone. She walks into the living room. 
               Lindsey is back watching the TV Horrorthon.

                                     LINDSEY
                              (excitedly)
                         I'm scared.

                                     ANNIE
                         Then why are you sitting here with 
                         the lights off?

                                     LINDSEY
                         I don't know.

                                     ANNIE
                         Well, come on, get your coat. We're 
                         going to pick up Paul.

                                     LINDSEY
                         I don't want to.

                                     ANNIE
                         Look, Lindsey, I thought we 
                         understood each other.

                                     LINDSEY
                         I want to stay here and watch this.

               Annie calculates a moment.

                                     ANNIE
                         Okay, if I can fix it so you can 
                         watch TV with Tommy Doyle would 
                         you like that?

               Lindsey's eyes light up.

                                     LINDSEY
                         Yes.

                                     ANNIE
                         Come with me.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

               Annie and Lindsey come out of the Wallace house. Lindsey 
               carries a bowl of popcorn. Annie has a coat over the 
               negligee.

               They walk down the street to the Doyle's. The wind blows 
               strong and whips the negligee around Annie's lets.  

               ANOTHER ANGLE -- STREET

               As the girls make their way down the street. The shape 
               steps into the glow of a streetlight and watches them. He 
               pulls a large knife from his pocket. The blade glistens in 
               the light.

               INT. DOYLE HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Laurie and Tommy are covered with pumpkin meat when the 
               doorbell rings. Tommy runs to answer it. He opens the door.

               Annie and Lindsey stand there.

                                     TOMMY
                         Hi, come on in. We're making a 
                         Jack-o'-lantern.

                                     LINDSEY
                         I want to watch TV.

               Lindsey see the TV on and runs into the living room. She 
               takes off her coat; sits in front of the TV and eats her 
               popcorn.

               Laurie comes from the kitchen. She glances at Annie's coat.

                                     LAURIE
                         Fancy.

                                     ANNIE
                         This has not been my night. My 
                         clothes are in the wash, I spilled 
                         butter down the front of me, I got 
                         stuck in a window...

                                     LAURIE
                         I'm glad you're here because I 
                         have something I want you to do. I 
                         want you to call up Ben Tramer and 
                         tell him you were just fooling 
                         around.

                                     ANNIE
                         I can't.

                                     LAURIE
                         Yes, you can.

                                     ANNIE
                         He went out drinking beer with 
                         Mike Godfrey and he won't be back 
                         until late. You'll have to call 
                         him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my 
                         way to pick up Paul.

               Laurie glances at Lindsey.

                                     LAURIE
                         Wait a minute here...

                                     ANNIE
                         If you watch her, I'll consider 
                         talking to Ben Tramer in the 
                         morning.

                                     LAURIE
                         Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was 
                         grounded.

                                     ANNIE
                         He was. Old jerko found a way to 
                         sneak out. Listen, I'll call you 
                         in an hour or so.

               Before Laurie can say anything else, Annie rushes out the 
               door. Laurie closes the door and looks in at Tommy and 
               Lindsey engrossed in the Horrorthon.

                                     LAURIE
                         The old girl scout comes through 
                         again.

               EXT. WALLACE HOUSE -- GARAGE -- NIGHT

               Annie hurries across the backyard and steps into the garage.

               She walks to her car.

                                     ANNIE
                              (sings to herself)
                         Oh, Paul, I give you all...

               She tries the door. It is locked.

                                     ANNIE
                              (continuing)
                         No keys, but please... my Paul.

               Quickly she turns and walks out of the garage.

               INT. WALLACE HOUSE

               Annie wanders through the empty house looking for her purse.  
               She finds it in the front room, takes out her brush and 
               lipstick and stands in front of the mirror primping.

                                     ANNIE
                              (sings)
                         My Paul, I can no longer stall...

               She glances up at her image in the mirror.

                                     ANNIE
                              (continuing)
                         Lucky thing. Spilled butter on her 
                         clothes, but nobody will know...
                              (sings)
                         except for Paul...

               Suddenly the phone RINGS. Quickly Annie grabs it.

                                     ANNIE
                         Hello. Oh hi, Dad.
                              (pause)
                         No, just watching TV with Lindsey.
                              (pause)
                         Be careful about what?
                              (pause)
                         Well, if you won't tell me how can 
                         I be careful?
                              (pause)
                         Sure, sure I will. Bye, dad.

               She hangs up, grabs her purse and rushes out the door.

               INT. GARAGE

               Annie walks into the garage, over to her car and opens the 
               door. It is now unlocked, but Annie doesn't notice.

               INT. CAR

               Annie slides in and inserts the key in the ignition. The 
               car starts. Annie glances at the car door lock. Suddenly 
               she remembers it was locked. She stares at it, puzzled.

               An instant later, a man sits up in the back seat.

               He wears a Halloween mask made of rubber with the grotesque 
               features of a man. He reaches forward and grabs her.

               Annie SCREAMS. She lurches for the door. The man puts one 
               hand over her mouth and brings the huge butcher knife up 
               to her throat.

               INT. GARAGE -- ANGLE ON CAR

               From outside the car we see the struggle inside. Annie's 
               Anguished face presses against the steamed window. Her 
               SCREAMS are muffled by the closed car.

               Suddenly, the struggle stops.

               Annie's face slides down the car window leaving a track in 
               the wet surface. Then slowly the track in the glass steams 
               over again.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. DOYLE HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Music from Invasion of the Body Snatchers fills the room.  
               Lindsey and Tommy are riveted to the screen.

               Tommy glances at Lindsey and slowly sneaks away from the 
               couch. He jumps to a window and ducks behind a curtain.

                                     TOMMY
                              (from behind curtain)
                         Lindsey. Lindsey.

               Lindsey turns around and looks for Tommy.

                                     LINDSEY
                         Where are you?

               No answer. Lindsey gets up from the couch to search for 
               Tommy.

               BEHIND CURTAIN

               Tommy hides, preparing to jump out and scare Lindsey. For 
               a moment, he glances out the window.

               TOMMY'S POV -- WALLACE BACKYARD

               The figure of a man carries what seems to be a body across 
               the Wallace's backyard.

               INT. DOYLE HOUSE

               Tommy SCREAMS and jumps out from the curtain, scaring the 
               hell out of Lindsey, who also SCREAMS and begins crying.

                                     TOMMY
                         There he is, there he is! The 
                         Boogeyman!

               Laurie rushes in from the kitchen finding the children in 
               tears.

                                     LAURIE
                         What's wrong?

               Tommy points out the window.

                                     TOMMY
                         I saw him again! He's over at 
                         Lindsey's house. The Boogeyman!

               At this, Lindsey begins to CRY even louder. Laurie bends 
               down to comfort her.

                                     LAURIE
                         Tommy, stop it! You're scaring 
                         Lindsey.

                                     TOMMY
                         I saw him...

                                     LAURIE
                         I said, stop it! There is no 
                         Boogeyman. There's nothing out 
                         there. If you don't stop all this, 
                         I'm turning off the TV and you go 
                         to bed.

               Tommy turns away from Laurie and Lindsey and walks over to 
               the couch in front of the TV set. Almost instantly, Lindsey 
               stops crying and follows him.

                                     TOMMY
                         Nobody believes me.

                                     LINDSEY
                         I believe you, Tommy.

               Lindsey sits up next to Tommy and hugs him.

               Laurie shakes her head and walks back into the kitchen.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. MYERS HOUSE -- NIGHT

               The old Myers house looks ominous and foreboding silhouetted 
               against the dark, whishing trees. CAMERA TRACKS behind the 
               hedge to where Loomis sits waiting.

               Suddenly, there are noises from the street. Loomis parts 
               the hedge in front of him and stares.

               LOOMIS' POV -- STREET

               Three boys, Keith, Richie, and Lonnie (from the playground) 
               creep up to the edge of the sidewalk in front of the old 
               house. They stare fearfully at the dark, tomb-like 
               structure.

                                     LONNIE
                         I'm not afraid.

                                     RICHIE
                         Bullshit.

                                     RONNIE
                         I'm not!   
                         Then go in.

               For a moment Lonnie hesitates, then slowly moves through 
               the front gate up toward the porch.

               ANGLE ON LOOMIS

               He watches the young boy walk toward the house, unsure 
               whether he should interfere or just watch.

               LOOMIS' POV -- OLD HOUSE -- STREET

               Lonnie makes it to the front porch and tentatively steps 
               up to the door. He glances back to his friends in the 
               street.

               Loomis' POV moves to the street.

                                     RICHIE
                         Chicken!

                                     KEITH
                         Go on, Lonnie!   

               Then Loomis' POV moves back to Lonnie at the front door. 
               The boy turns to open the door. He's scared out of his 
               mind

               ANGLE ON LOOMIS

               Loomis quietly stands up behind the hedge.

                                     LOOMIS
                         Lonnie...

               LOOMIS' POV -- OLD HOUSE

               Lonnie spins around and stares in horror at the talking 
               hedge.

               ANGLE ON LOOMIS

                                     LOOMIS
                         Get your ass away from there!

               LOOMIS' POV -- OLD HOUSE -- STREET

               Moving like the wind, Lonnie barrels off the porch and 
               races back to his friends. The three boys hurtle off down 
               the dark street in utter terror.

               ANGLE ON LOOMIS

               He watches them race away, smiling to himself.

               Suddenly, two hands enter frame and grab Loomis' shoulders.  
               Loomis jumps and spins around.

               Standing there is Brackett.

                                     LOOMIS
                         Jesus!

                                     BRACKETT
                         You all right?

                                     LOOMIS
                         Sure...

                                     BRACKETT
                         Nothing's going on. Just kids 
                         playing pranks, trick or treating, 
                         parking, getting high... I have 
                         the feeling you're way off on 
                         this...

                                     LOOMIS
                         You have the wrong feeling.

                                     BRACKETT
                         You're not coming up with much to 
                         prove me wrong.

                                     LOOMIS
                         Exactly what do you need?

                                     BRACKETT
                         Well, its going to take more than 
                         fancy talk to keep me up all night 
                         creeping around these bushes.

                                     LOOMIS
                         I watched him for fifteen years, 
                         sitting in a room staring at a 
                         wall, not seeing the wall, seeing 
                         past it, seeing this night. He's 
                         waited for it, inhumanly patient.  
                         Hour after hour, day after day, 
                         waiting for some silent, invisible 
                         alarm to trigger him. Death has 
                         arrived in your little town, 
                         sheriff. You can ignore it, or you 
                         can help me stop it.

                                     BRACKETT
                         More fancy talk... You want to 
                         know what Haddonfield is?  Families. 
                         Children, all lined up in rows, up 
                         and down these streets. You're 
                         telling me they're lined up for a 
                         slaughterhouse.

                                     LOOMIS
                         They could be.

                                     BRACKETT
                         I'll stay out with you tonight, 
                         Doctor, just on that chance that 
                         you're right. And if you are right, 
                         damn you for letting him out.

               Brackett turns and walks back to the street. Loomis watches 
               him for several moments.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. WALLACE HOUSE -- NIGHT

               The house is quiet, dark. The lights are all out. Annie's 
               car is parked in the garage.

               A car pulls up in front of the house and parks. Its lights 
               flick off. The sounds of LAUGHTER come from inside.

               INT. CAR -- NIGHT

               BOB SIMMS, a good-looking 17-year-old, POPS open a can of 
               beer. Next to him Lynda guzzles hers. They embrace.

                                     LYNDA
                         Now... First we'll talk a little, 
                         then Annie will distract Lindsey 
                         and we sneak quietly up the stairs 
                         to the first bedroom on the left.
                         Got it?

                                     BOB
                         Okay. First I rip your clothes 
                         off.

               Bob grabs Lynda and she starts giggling. The can of beer 
               falls over onto the front seat.

                                     LYNDA
                         You idiot!

                                     BOB
                         ...Then you rip my clothes off.
                         Then we rip Lindsey's clothes off.
                         I think I've got it.

                                     LYNDA
                         Totally...

               EXT. WALLACE HOUSE

               Bob opens the door and together they fall out onto the 
               ground. Bob picks Lynda up and carries her up to the front 
               door.

                                     LYNDA
                         Bob... Put me down. Put me down.
                         This is totally silly.

               Lynda squirms in Bob's arms. As he sets her down her foot 
               accidentally hits the front door and it swings open. Lynda 
               and Bob both stop.

                                     LYNDA
                         Annie, Annie, we're here!

               Bob and Lynda enter the house.

               INT. WALLACE HOUSE -- NIGHT

               The living room is empty. The lights are off. Lynda and 
               Bob enter the house and begin turning on the lights.

                                     BOB
                         I wonder where they went.

                                     LYNDA
                         Annie probably took Lindsey out or 
                         something. Let's look for a note.

               Bob walks over to Lynda.

                                     BOB
                         Let's don't.

               They embrace. Bob pulls Lynda over to the couch and turns 
               out the light. They kiss. A shadow comes over them. They 
               continue kissing, unaware of the shape of a man on the 
               stairway watching.

               INT. DOYLE HOUSE -- NIGHT

               The house is totally black inside. The only sound is the 
               music score from "The Thing."

               Suddenly, the sound of laughter is heard from the kitchen. 
               Then an orange light floats through the room. As it gets 
               closer, we see that Laurie is carrying a Jack-o'-lantern, 
               with a candle illuminating from the center of the pumpkin. 
               Behind Laurie is Tommy and Lindsey making scary noises.  
               The procession continues through the house.

                                     TOMMY
                         Oooooo... He's gonna get you.

                                     LINDSEY
                         No, he's not.

                                     LAURIE
                         Nobody's going to get anybody. Now 
                         stop scaring each other.

               The procession continues to the front window. Laurie places 
               the Jack-o'-lantern on the windowsill. She looks down the 
               street toward the Wallace's.

               LAURIE'S POV OF THE WALLACE HOUSE

               Laurie sees Bob's car parked in front of the house.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               Laurie smiles to herself.

                                     LAURIE
                         Everybody has a good time tonight. 
                         Okay, kids, what do you want to do 
                         now.

                                     LINDSEY
                         Let's make more popcorn.

                                     LAURIE
                         You've had enough. Why don't we 
                         just sit down and watch the rest 
                         of the movie.

               Laurie sits down on the couch and sighs. Lindsey and Tommy 
               cuddle up with her, one on either side.

               The phone rings.

               Laurie gets up to answer it.

                                     LAURIE
                         Hello.

               INT. HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Lynda sits on the couch in the dark. Her hair and clothes 
               are messed up. Bob lies on the couch, his head on her lap.

                                     LYNDA
                         Hi, Laurie, what's up?

                                     LAURIE (V.O.)
                         Nothing. I was just sitting down 
                         for the first time tonight.

                                     LYNDA
                         Is Annie around?

                                     LAURIE
                         No. I thought she'd be home by 
                         now. She went to pick up Paul.

                                     LYNDA
                         Well, she's totally not here.

                                     LAURIE (V.O.)
                         They probably stopped off somewhere. 
                         Have her call me when she gets 
                         back. I've got Lindsey here and I 
                         want to know what time to put her 
                         to bed.

                                     LYNDA
                         Okay. Later.

                                     LAURIE (V.O.)
                         Have a good time.

               Lynda hangs up the phone and grins.

                                     LYNDA
                         We sure will.

               Lynda grabs Bob's hand and stands up.

                                     LYNDA
                              (continuing)
                         Lindsey is gone for the night.

               Bob grins.

                                     BOB
                         Now that's wonderful.

               Lynda pulls Bob up from the couch and they walk quickly up 
               the stairs.

               INT. DOYLE HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Laurie stands by the telephone. She walks to the window 
               and glances out.

               LAURIE'S POV -- WALLACE HOUSE

               It is dark.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               Laurie shrugs, turns away from the window and walks back 
               to Tommy and Lindsey sitting on the couch.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. WALLACE BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               Sounds of lovemaking come from the bed. The only light is 
               a candle illuminating the sheets as they move slowly up 
               and down and from side to side. Empty beer cans leave a 
               trail from the door to the bed.

               The moans from Lynda begin increasing. They get louder. 
               Building to a crescendo. The phone rings. The lovemaking 
               suddenly stops.

                                     LYNDA
                         Shit! Not again.

               Lynda rises up on one arm. The sheet falls away from her, 
               showing a very beautiful young body. Her hair is a mess 
               and she is frustrated. The phone continues to ring.

                                     BOB
                         I can't help it. It just keeps 
                         ringing.

                                     LYNDA
                         And I can't keep you interested?

                                     BOB
                         Should we answer it?

               Bob opens a fresh can of beer. He chugs it down.

                                     LYNDA
                         That's great. Now you'll be too 
                         drunk to...

                                     BOB
                         Just answer the damn phone.

                                     LYNDA
                         I can't. What if it's the Wallaces!?  
                         We'd get Annie in trouble.

               The phone stops ringing.

                                     BOB
                         Take it off the hook.

               Lynda reaches over and kisses Bob behind the ears. She 
               slowly moves around his ear with her tongue. Bob grabs 
               Lynda and pushes her down on the bed.

               CAMERA MOVES BACK from the bed as their lovemaking 
               continues, back through the bedroom doorway. Standing there 
               in the darkness is the shape watching them.

               Finally, Bob and Lynda climax. Bob rolls off Lynda. She 
               lights a cigarette and hands it to Bob, then lights one 
               for herself.

                                     LYNDA
                         Fantastic. Totally.

                                     BOB
                         Yeah.

                                     LYNDA
                         Want a beer?

                                     BOB
                         Yeah.

                                     LYNDA
                         Is that all you have to say?

                                     BOB
                         Yeah.

                                     LYNDA
                         Go get me a beer.

                                     BOB
                         I thought you were gonna get one 
                         for me.

                                     LYNDA
                         Yeah?

               Bob gets out of bed and pulls his jeans on. He looks for 
               his glasses. He finds them and puts them on.

                                     BOB
                         I'll be right back. Don't get
                         Dressed.

               Bob leans over and kisses Lynda. He leaves.

               Lynda leans back onto the pillows. She smiles to herself.

               INT. WALLACE KITCHEN

               Bob comes through the swinging doors. He opens the 
               refrigerator and takes out two beers. He looks around the 
               kitchen. He opens some cupboards and takes out a bag of 
               potato chips. In another cupboard, he finds a can of 
               peanuts.

               Bob gathers the food and beer into his arms. He shuts out 
               the light with his elbow. He turns to leave the doors. 
               WHAM! He steps into a chair, knocking him backwards. The 
               beer falls on the floor along with the chips and peanuts. 
               Bob leans down to pick them up.

                                     BOB
                         Goddammit!

               ANOTHER ANGLE 153

               Bob has his head down, intent on cleaning up the mess.There 
               is a SLAM from across the kitchen. Bob looks up. 

               BOB'S POV -- DOOR

               The back door of the kitchen slowly swings open, as if it 
               has been slammed shut and the bolt didn't catch. It squeaks 
               on its hinges as it swings back and forth.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Slowly, Bob gets to his feet and walks over to the door.

                                     BOB
                         Annie, Paul...

               He steps to the door and looks outside. 

               BOB'S POV -- BACKYARD

               The yard is empty. Just the wind blowing the trees.

               ANGLE ON BOB

               He turns from the door.

               There is a SQUEAK from one of the two closet doors by the 
               kitchen counter.Bob freezes, staring at the two doors.

                                     BOB
                         Lynda, you asshole!

               He walks to one of the doors and opens it. Nothing inside.

                                     BOB
                              (continuing)
                         All right, Lynda, come on out.

               He steps to the other door and opens it.

               Right behind the door stands the shape wearing the rubber 
               mask.

               He steps out and grabs Bob around the neck in an 
               instantaneous lunge.

               Bob tries to jump away, but the shape has a firm hold on 
               his neck. Bob COUGHS and GAGS from the pressure.

               Then the shape lifts Bob up off the floor.

               ANGLE ON BOB'S FEET

               Bob's feet leave the floor.

               ANGLE ON BOB'S FACE

               He makes a guttural sound deep in his throat as the shape's 
               hand closes tightly around his windpipe.

               ANGLE ON SHAPE

               Behind the mask are two burning eyes. The shape moves 
               forward.

               ANGLE ON WALL

               Still holding him up with one hand the shape SLAMS Bob 
               against the wall, holding him up several feet off the floor.  
               Bob struggles to get free.

               The shape lifts his other hand. It holds the butcher knife.

               The shape drives the knife deeply into Bob's chest with a 
               SLAMMING THUD, the other end of the knife stuck through 
               the wall.

               Then the shape steps away. Bob hangs there, impaled on the 
               wall, eyes still open in horror, dead.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. WALLACE BEDROOM

               Lynda lounges on the bed smoking another cigarette. She 
               hears Bob enter the room but doesn't look up.

                                     LYNDA
                         Where's my beer?

               No answer. Lynda turns around and looks.

               ANOTHER ANGLE -- LYNDA'S POV

               The shape stands in the doorway. He is covered with a sheet 
               like a ghost. He wears Bob's glasses.

                                     LYNDA
                              (continuing)
                         Cute, Bob. Real cute.

               The ghost doesn't answer.

               ANOTHER ANGLE -- LYNDA AND GHOST

               Lynda looks at the ghost. She slides the sheets down from 
               her body.

                                     LYNDA
                              (continuing)
                         Come here, you fool.The ghost 
                         doesn't answer. He continues to 
                         stare at Lynda. Can't I get your 
                         ghost, Bob?

               Lynda laughs at her own joke, then stops when she sees the 
               ghost is motionless.

                                     LYNDA
                              (continuing)
                         All right, all right. So where's 
                         the beer.

               Nothing. The ghost just stands there.

                                     LYNDA
                              (continuing)
                         Well, answer me! Okay, don't answer 
                         me. Boy, are you weird!

               Lynda gets out of bed. She is nude and looks beautiful and 
               sensuous in the candle light. She walks over to the phone.

                                     LYNDA
                              (continuing)
                         Well, I'm gonna call Laurie.  I 
                         wanna know where Annie and Paul 
                         are. This isn't going anywhere.

               Lynda sits down on a chair by the telephone. In the b.g. 
               the ghost stands in the doorway. She starts to dial the 
               phone. The ghost starts walking toward her.

               INT. DOYLE HOUSE -- NIGHT

               The house is very quiet. The kids are asleep. Laurie is 
               sitting on the couch knitting. The phone RINGS.

                                     LAURIE
                         Finally.

               Laurie crosses to answer the phone.

               INT. WALLACE BEDROOM

               Lynda holds the phone to her ear. The ghost walks up slowly 
               behind her. He raises his hands to grab her.

               INT. DOYLE HOUSE

               Laurie answers the telephone.

                                     LAURIE
                         Hello.

               INT. WALLACE BEDROOM

               Lynda hears Laurie's hello as the ghost grabs the phone. 
               He clamps one hand over Lynda's mouth. She squirms and 
               writhes. He takes the telephone cord and wraps it around 
               her neck.

               INT. DOYLE HOUSE

                                     LAURIE
                         Hello?

               Laurie hears SQUEALS, and rustling sounds across the phone.

                                     LAURIE
                              (continuing)
                         All right, Annie! I've heard your 
                         famous chewing, now I get your 
                         famous squeals?

               Laurie continues to hear weird SOUNDS.

                                     LAURIE
                              (continuing)
                         Annie?

               INT. WALLACE BEDROOM

               Lynda tries to fight off the ghost. He wraps the cord around 
               the neck. He pulls tight. Lynda reaches up and pulls on 
               the sheet. It slides off of the man, to reveal the grotesque 
               Halloween mask.

               Lynda gasps and tries to scream. The man pulls the cord 
               tighter. Her face turns blue. She opens her mouth, trying 
               to get air, then slowly slumps forward and remains 
               motionless. Lynda is dead.

               The shape picks up the receiver and puts it to his ear.

               INT. DOYLE HOUSE -- ANGLE ON LAURIE

                                     LAURIE
                         Annie, Annie! Are you all right?

               Silence over the phone.

                                     LAURIE
                              (continuing)
                         Are you fooling around again?

               Silence.

                                     LAURIE
                              (continuing)
                         I'll kill you if this is a joke!

               More silence.

                                     LAURIE
                              (continuing)
                         Annie...

               Suddenly the phone goes dead.

               Laurie stares at the receiver, then hangs up. She crosses 
               to the window and looks out toward the Wallace house.

               LAURIE'S. POV -- WALLACE HOUSE

               The street is quiet, dark and windy. Bob's car is parked 
               in front of the Wallace house.

               Suddenly a light goes on in the bedroom.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She stares at the house, puzzled.

               LAURIE'S. POV -- WALLACE HOUSE

               Then the light goes off.

               INT. DOYLE HOUSE

               Laurie moves from the window back to the telephone and 
               dials Annie's number. We HEAR the phone ringing on the 
               other end.

               INT. WALLACE HOUSE -- BEDROOM

               CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS through the darkened bedroom of the 
               Wallace house. There is no sign of a struggle. The room is 
               empty. The phone RINGS away.

               INT. DOYLE HOUSE

               Laurie finally hangs up the phone. She stands for a moment 
               considering it, then turns and walks upstairs.

               INT. DOYLE BEDROOM

               Laurie opens the door to the bedroom. Tommy and Lindsey 
               are sound asleep on the bed. She looks at them a moment, 
               then closes the door behind her.

               INT. DOYLE HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM

               Laurie comes back downstairs. She takes a key out of her 
               purse and again steps to the window.

               LAURIE'S POV -- WALLACE HOUSE

               Dark and silent.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She steps to the front door.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. MYERS HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Loomis sits in silence behind the hedge watching the Myers 
               house. Frustrated, he gets up and walks to the street.

               For a moment he glances back at the Myers house, then starts 
               down the quiet residential street.

               LOOMIS' POV -- STREET -- STATION WAGON

               It is empty except for a station wagon parked several blocks 
               away.

               ANGLE ON LOOMIS

               He turns away from the street. Then a thought strikes him. 
               He looks again.

               LOOMIS' POV -- STREET -- STATION WAGON

               The lone car is Loomis' station wagon.

               ANGLE ON LOOMIS

               He's not certain of it. Slowly Loomis starts walking down 
               the street toward the station wagon.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

               Laurie locks the Doyle house and walks away out into the 
               street. The wind whips her clothes and hair.

               LAURIE'S POV -- WALLACE HOUSE -- MOVING SHOT 

               MOVING SHOT TOWARD THE WALLACE HOUSE, DARK AND OMINOUS

               MOVING SHOT -- LAURIE

               She moves down the street, shivering in the chill wind. 

               She puts the key to the Doyle house in her pocket.

               LAURIE'S POV -- WALLACE HOUSE -- MOVING SHOT 

               Car turns the corner and drives past the Wallace house, 
               casting a strange shadowy pattern across the front of the 
               house.

               MOVING SHOT -- LAURIE

               She picks up her speed now up the sidewalk.

               LAURIE'S POV -- WALLACE HOUSE -- MOVING SHOT

               The house looms closer and closer.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               TRACKING SHOT with Loomis as he walks up the street.

               LOOMIS' POV -- STATION WAGON

               The station wagon moves closer.

               MOVING SHOT -- LOOMIS

               He recognizes it and races forward.

               LOOMIS' POV -- STATION WAGON

               CAMERA TRACKS IN to the station wagon, right up to the state 
               emblem emblazoned on the side.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. WALLACE HOUSE -- NIGHT

               CAMERA MOVES UP to the front of the Wallace house. 

               Laurie walks up to the front porch. She stands there a 
               moment, listening, as if to hear some sound of life from 
               the inside.

               She KNOCKS on the door and RINGS the doorbell. She waits.

               Silence.

               She steps off the porch and walks around to the side of 
               the house, CAMERA TRACKING WITH HER. She moves to the garage 
               and peeks inside. There is Annie's car.

               Laurie thinks a moment, then looks to the street.

               LAURIE'S POV -- BOB'S CAR

               Bob's car sits there on the street.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She turns and walks through the breezeway between the house 
               and the garage around to the back door.

               The kitchen door is ajar, swinging back and forth in the 
               wind.

               Laurie pulls open the door and steps into the house.

               INT. WALLACE KITCHEN

               The kitchen is dark. Laurie stands there a moment staring 
               into the blackness.

                                     LAURIE
                         Annie?

               No answer.

                                     LAURIE
                              (continuing)
                         Bob, Lynda, Annie?

               No one answers. Laurie searches for the wall light. She 
               flips it and nothing happens. She looks again into the 
               darkness.

                                     LAURIE
                              (continuing)
                         Hello?

               Nothing. Laurie moves forward into the house, CAMERA 
               TRACKING WITH HER.

               Laurie walks into the living room. She stops to let her 
               eyes get accustomed to the almost total darkness. She 
               reaches for a nearby lamp and trips over the cord. The 
               lamp CLUNKS to the floor.

                                     LAURIE
                              (continuing)
                         Shit.

               Suddenly there is a CRASHING SOUND from upstairs.

               Laurie spins around and stares up the dark staircase.

               Another SQUEAK from above.

               Laurie smiles.

                                     LAURIE
                              (continuing)
                         All right, meatheads. The joke is 
                         over.

               Silence.

                                     LAURIE
                              (continuing)
                         Come on, Annie, enough.

               Another SOUND from upstairs, a DRAGGING across the floor.

               Laurie moves to the head of the staircase. 

               The dragging sound stops abruptly. Silence.

                                     LAURIE
                              (continuing)
                         This has most definitely stopped 
                         being funny. Now cut it out!

               A SCRAPING SOUND, then silence.

                                     LAURIE
                              (continuing)
                         You'll be sorry.

               Slowly Laurie starts up the staircase.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

               Loomis stands by his car glancing up and down the empty 
               street. Finally he makes up his mind and starts moving 
               down the street, almost running, looking back and forth at 
               the rows of houses on either side for something out of 
               place.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. WALLACE HOUSE -- NIGHT

               SLOWLY TRACKING up the staircase.

               MOVING SHOT -- LAURIE

               As she slowly moves up the stairs. She reaches the top and 
               stops.

               LAURIE'S POV -- SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

               It is totally dark. At the end of the hall is the bedroom 
               door.  From around the edges of the door is the faintest 
               orange glow.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She moves for the door, CAMERA TRACKING WITH HER.

               LAURIE'S POV -- DOOR 

               She reaches the door. Her hand reaches out and touches it.

               The door swings open.

               A Jack-o'-lantern casts an eerie glow around the room. 
               There is someone lying on the bed but from this position 
               Laurie can't see.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She moves forward toward the bed.

               LAURIE'S POV

               CAMERA MOVES FORWARD. There on the bed is Annie! Her face 
               is a chalky white and there is a huge red gash across her 
               throat.

               At the head of the bed is Judith Myer's tombstone.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She stares at the bed and then SCREAMS at the top of her 
               lungs.

               Suddenly something drops down at her from above.

               Laurie jumps back to the door.

               LAURIE'S POV -- BOB 

               Strung up to the light fixture on the ceiling, dangling 
               there in the middle of the room, is Bob, eyes open and 
               staring.

               INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

               Laurie backs out of the bedroom. Her mouth is open in 
               speechless horror.

               Suddenly a door next to her slowly opens. There is Lynda 
               standing there, propped up by a chair, staring at her with 
               glazed, dead eyes.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE -- CORNER (LIGHTING EFFECT)

               Laurie shrinks back into a dark corner. She can only stare 
               in horror at the sight of her friend.

               Suddenly we are aware of something there in the dark 
               corner.

               It is almost as if our eyes have suddenly begun to adjust 
               to the darkness and we see the outline of a man standing 
               right behind her.

               The outline becomes more and more clear. It is the shape, 
               wearing the mask, the butcher knife in his hand, gleaming, 
               right behind Laurie.

               Laurie suddenly moves away from the corner.

               The shape lunges out at her.

               CLOSE SHOT -- LAURIE'S BACK -- HAND

               The hand grasps a piece of Laurie's blouse and RIPS it.

               CLOSE SHOT -- LAURIE

               She SCREAMS and spins around.

               ANGLE ON SHAPE

               He stands there holding up the piece of material, then 
               raises the butcher knife and moves for her.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               CAMERA MOVES WITH HER as she backs away, SCREAMING at the 
               top of her lungs.

               ANGLE ON SHAPE

               He lunges at her suddenly with the knife.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE -- TOP OF STAIRCASE

               The knife slices across her arm, ripping her flesh.

               Laurie suddenly jumps backward, raising her arm 
               instinctively.

               ANGLE ON RAILING.

               Laurie bumps back into the railing.

               ANGLE ON SHAPE

               He lunges again with the knife.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She leaps backward to avoid the blade and slips over the 
               edge of the railing.

               LAURIE'S POV

               CAMERA PLUNGES DOWN from the second floor and SLAMS into 
               the floor.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She hits the floor and rolls over, holding her leg 
               painfully. Then she looks up at the staircase. 

               POV STAIRCASE

               The shape moves to the top of the staircase and starts 
               down toward her.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She pulls herself up off the floor and hobbles into the 
               living room. 

               ANGLE ON STAIRCASE

               The shape races down the stairs. 

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She moves for the kitchen. She trips on the fallen lamps 
               and falls to the floor. 

               ANGLE ON SHAPE

               The shape steps into the living room, knife raised.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE -- KITCHEN

               She crawls to the kitchen, rolls inside and SLAMS the 
               kitchen door behind her. In a flash she leaps up and CLICKS 
               the lock.

               There is a POUNDING on the door from the other side.

               Laurie slowly climbs to her feet and limps toward the back 
               door.

               Suddenly the kitchen door EXPLODES, the middle of it 
               breaking apart. The shape reaches through, groping for the 
               lock.

               Laurie reaches the back door.

               ANGLE ON DOOR

               Her hand tries the door. It is key-locked.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               Desperately she tries the door, glancing behind her.

               ANGLE ON SHAPE

               The shape's hand reaches for the lock.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She steps back from the door into the kitchen.  

               LAURIE'S POV -- KITCHEN WINDOW

               She sees the kitchen window over the sink.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She hobbles to the sink, climbs up on it and grabs the 
               window. With a heave she opens it up halfway.

               ANGLE ON SHAPE

               The shape's hand grabs the lock and CLICKS it open.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE -- KITCHEN WINDOW

               She can only get it three-fourths open. Headfirst she crawls 
               through the window.

               ANGLE ON SHAPE

               The shape pushes the door open and leaps into the kitchen.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She drags herself roughly out the window.

               CLOSE SHOT -- WINDOW

               The shape grabs at Laurie's legs as they disappear through 
               the sill.

               EXT. WALLACE HOUSE

               Laurie picks herself up from the ground and runs as fast 
               as she can, limping across the backyard, CAMERA MOVING 
               WITH HER. She passes the driveway and scurries into the 
               neighbor's backyard, up to the back door of the house. She 
               POUNDS furiously on the door.

                                     LAURIE
                         Help me!  Help me!

               She looks behind her.

               LAURIE'S POV -- WALLACE HOUSE

               No sign of the shape. The house is dark and silent.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               The back porch light comes on. Laurie continues to POUND 
               on the door.

               LAURIE'S POV -- DOOR

               Through the glass in the back door we see an OLD WOMAN 
               dressed in a nightgown approach.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

                                     LAURIE
                         Please, help me! Call the police!  
                         Please!

               LAURIE'S POV -- DOOR

               The old woman stares at her suspiciously for a moment, 
               then turns from the door and walks away.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               The porch light goes out.

                                     LAURIE
                         No! No!  Please, open the door!

               She turns around and looks back.

               LAURIE'S POV -- WALLACE HOUSE

               Nothing. No sign of the shape.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She hobbles off the back porch and runs across the yard to 
               the street.  CAMERA MOVES WITH HER as she limps along.

               EXT. DOYLE HOUSE

               Laurie rushes up to the front door. She reaches in her 
               pocket for the key and drops it on the porch.

               Quickly she bends down and scrambles for it. She looks 
               back toward the street.

               LAURIE'S POV -- STREET

               The street is empty. The wind WHISHES the trees. Leaves 
               sprinkle down.

               EXT. DOYLE HOUSE

               Laurie gropes around for the key. It lies over a crack in 
               the wooden porch. She reaches for it but her finger nudge 
               the key between the crack, down out of sight.

               Laurie SCREAMS with frustration and glances back at the 
               street.

               LAURIE'S POV -- STREET

               The shape walks slowly down the middle of the street, right 
               toward her!

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               Laurie begins to BANG on the front door.

                                     LAURIE
                         Tommy!  Tommy, open the door!

               She grabs a planter on the porch, steps back and hurls it 
               at an upstairs window.

               ANGLE ON UPSTAIRS WINDOW

               The planter SMASHES against the window. A light goes on. 
               Tommy appears sleepily at the window.

                                     TOMMY
                         Who is it?

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

                                     LAURIE
                         Tommy, let me in!

               She looks back at the street.

               LAURIE'S POV -- STREET

               The street is empty. The shape is gone.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She stands there breathlessly, her eyes burning in the 
               darkness.

               Finally the door opens. Tommy stands there in his pajamas.

               Laurie leaps inside and SLAMS the door.

               INT. DOYLE HOUSE 259

               Laurie bolts the door from the inside.

                                     LAURIE
                         Tommy, I want you to go back 
                         upstairs...

                                     TOMMY
                         What is it, Laurie?

                                     LAURIE
                         Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into 
                         the bedroom and lock the door!

                                     TOMMY
                         I'm scared...

                                     LAURIE
                         DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!

                                     TOMMY
                         It's the Boogeyman, isn't it?

                                     LAURIE
                         HURRY!  

               Tommy turns and runs upstairs CRYING.

               Laurie moves from the door to the telephone. She picks it 
               up, dials a number and waits.

               Then suddenly she reacts..  The phone is dead. No dial 
               tone.

               She puts down the phone and stands very still. There is a 
               slight breeze blowing her hair.Slowly Laurie moves around 
               the couch.

               LAURIE'S POV -- KITCHEN

               From the living room we see into the kitchen. The back 
               door is open.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               Laurie doesn't move.  She begins crying softly, her eyes 
               wide with fear.

                                     LAURIE
                         Please stop... Please...

               Silence. No movement anywhere in the house.Slowly Laurie 
               sinks down to her knees by the couch.

               CLOSE SHOT --KNITTING NEEDLES

               Her hand brushes against the knitting needles protruding 
               from her tote bag.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE -- COUCH

               She reacts to the feel of the knitting needles and pulls 
               one out. It is long and deadly sharp. She stares at it.

               Suddenly the shape leaps up from behind the couch! He 
               springs at her, plunging the butcher knife.

               ANGLE ON COUCH

               The blade of the butcher knife THUMPS into the couch.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE -- SHAPE

               Instinctively Laurie raises the knitting needle and drives 
               it home, right into the shape's neck!

               The shape springs backward, clawing at the needle, rolling 
               his head back and forth. Then suddenly he freezes, hands 
               outstretched, motionless, and falls in a heap on the floor.

               Laurie sits there.

               The shape doesn't move.

               Laurie begins to cry again, harder and harder.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

               CAMERA MOVES WITH LOOMIS as he moves along the street. 
               Suddenly two headlights hit him and a police car swerves 
               to a stop next to him. Brackett gets out.

                                     BRACKETT
                         Where were you? I went back to the 
                         Myers house...

                                     LOOMIS
                         I found the car! He's here!

                                     BRACKETT
                         Where!

                                     LOOMIS
                         Three blocks down. Get in the car 
                         and go up that other street then 
                         back down here. I'm going up the . 
                         block.

               Brackett turns and hurries back to the car.

               Loomis starts up the street again as Brackett pulls off in 
               the other direction.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. DOYLE HOUSE -- NIGHT

               WIDE SHOT of the living room. Laurie is on one side of 
               frame, the motionless shape lying behind the couch on the 
               other.

               Slowly Laurie stands up, stares at the shape and then moves 
               to the staircase.

               Slowly, painfully, Laurie climbs up the stairs.

               INT. BEDROOM

               Tommy and Lindsey are huddled in a corner WHIMPERING softly. 
               The door opens and Laurie steps in. The two children run 
               to her CRYING. She holds them in her arms tightly and nudges 
               the door shut with her foot.

                                     LAURIE
                         It's all right now. Shhh, it's all 
                         right...

               She takes the children back to the bed and sits down with 
               them.

                                     LAURIE
                              (continuing)
                         Now I want you to change your 
                         clothes, Tommy. We're going to 
                         take a walk outside.

                                     TOMMY
                         Was it the Boogeyman?

                                     LINDSEY
                         I'm scared!

                                     LAURIE
                         There's nothing to be scared of 
                         now. Get changed.

                                     TOMMY
                         Are you sure?

                                     LAURIE
                         Yes.

                                     TOMMY
                         How?

                                     LAURIE
                         I killed him...

                                     TOMMY
                         But you can't kill the Boogeyman.

               Suddenly the bedroom door swings open. Standing there is 
               the shape, the butcher knife raised.

               Both children SCREAM. Laurie shoves them into the bathroom 
               and pulls the door shut, leaving herself outside in the 
               bedroom.

                                     LAURIE
                         Lock the door! Lock the door!

               The shape moves for her, slowly now, but relentless, the 
               knife glistening.

               There is a CLICK as the bathroom door is locked. Laurie 
               leaps away from the door and circles around the bed.

               The shape keeps coming.

               Laurie dashes to a clothes closet and ducks inside.

               INT. CLOTHES CLOSET

               Laurie pulls the sliding doors closed and crawls back into 
               the small, dark interior of the closet.

               Suddenly the doors begin to buckle as the shape pounds on 
               them.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She reaches up and grabs a wire hanger from the top of the 
               closet. She rips off the shirt and begins unhooking it.

               ANGLE ON CLOSET DOOR

               The door buckles inward as the shape SMASHES against it.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She twists the top of the hanger, unwinding the wire.

               ANGLE ON CLOSET DOOR 

               The door BREAKS IN. The shape steps inside, pushing aside 
               the clothes.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She unhooks the hanger and bends it out straight.

               ANGLE ON SHAPE

               The shape leans in, peering down at Laurie in the corner, 
               raising the knife.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               Holding the hanger with both hands she thrusts it forward 
               with all her might.

               ANGLE ON SHAPE

               The wire hanger flashes into the shape's right eye.He leaps 
               back in pain, dropping the butcher knife, grabbing his eye 
               with both hands.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She grasps the butcher knife with both hands and jabs it 
               upward.

               ANGLE ON SHAPE

               The butcher knife plunges into the shape's mid-section, 
               right down to the hilt. The shape stumbles backward out of 
               the closet.

               ANGLE ON LAURIE

               She just sits there in the corner of the closet. There is 
               a THUMP from the bedroom, then silence.

               Slowly Laurie crawls around and peeks out of the closet 
               doors.

               LAURIE'S POV -- SHAPE

               The shape lies on the floor by the bed, the butcher knife 
               protruding from his stomach.

               INT. BEDROOM

               Laurie emerges from the closet and carefully crosses the 
               bedroom, avoiding the shape's body. She goes to the bathroom 
               door and knocks softly.

                                     LAURIE
                         Tommy, it's me. Open the door.

               There is a silence, then the door opens. On the other side 
               are Tommy and Lindsey, looking utterly terrified. Laurie 
               bends down and shields them from the sight of the shape.

                                     LAURIE
                              (continuing)
                         Now, I want you to walk to the 
                         door, down the stairs and right 
                         out the front door.

                                     LINDSEY
                         You're coming with us...

                                     LAURIE
                         Listen to me. I want you to walk 
                         down the street to the MacKensie's 
                         and knock on their door. You tell 
                         them to call the police and send 
                         them over here. Do you understand?

                                     TOMMY
                         Laurie, you come with us...

                                     LAURIE
                         No! Do as I say.

               She stands up and guides the children carefully across the 
               bedroom to the door and ushers them outside.

               She watches for a moment as they walk down the stairs, 
               then slumps down against the door frame in an exhausted 
               heap.

               EXT. DOYLE HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Tommy and Lindsey run out of the house and down the walk 
               to the sidewalk. They rush up the street. As they leave 
               frame we see Loomis on the other side of the street.

               ANGLE ON LOOMIS

               He watches the children with a puzzled frown.

               LOOMIS' POV -- TOMMY AND LINDSEY

               Shrieking with fear, Tommy and Lindsey run up the sidewalk.

               ANGLE ON LOOMIS

               He stares at them for a moment, then moves for the Doyle 
               house.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               INT. DOYLE HOUSE -- ANGLE THROUGH BEDROOM DOOR -- NIGHT

               We SEE through the bedroom door. In f.g. sits Laurie, 
               slumped against the door frame, staring out at nothing, 
               tears streaming down her face. In b.g. lies the shape.

               Slowly Laurie begins to pull herself together once again.

               She gets up to her knees and begins to pull herself up to 
               her feet.

               Her back is to the shape. As she starts to stand the shape 
               sits up, the head turning to Laurie.

               CLOSE SHOT -- LAURIE

               Laurie rises into frame, holding herself erect by grasping 
               the doorframe.

               Behind her the shape rises up into frame, quickly, silently.

               Laurie just hangs there on the doorframe. An exhausted, 
               ironic smile comes over her face.

                                     LAURIE
                         Well, kiddo. Some Halloween...

               Slowly the shape moves for her, his hands outstretched.

               Just as he is about to grab her, Laurie manages to step 
               out the door.

               ANGLE IN HALL

               Unaware he is behind her, Laurie limps toward the stairs.

               Suddenly the shape jumps out of the bedroom and grabs her, 
               hands around her neck.

               Laurie SCREAMS. She twists and squirms and claws at him, 
               her finger ripping at his mask. She pulls it off over his 
               face, wriggles out of his grip and turns around.

               CLOSE SHOT -- MICHAEL

               The shape, Michael, stares at her with his one eye. He has 
               a dank, white face with blond hair. There is something 
               completely unhuman about his features, the open mouth, the 
               dark staring eye.

               ANGLE IN HALL

               Michael lunges at her again.

               Suddenly there is a THUNDERING EXPLOSION and Michael is 
               blown off his feet. Laurie falls back against the wall.

               ANGLE ON LOOMIS

               Standing at the top of the stairs is Loomis, gun in his 
               hand. He moves forward down the hall.

               ANGLE IN HALL

               Michael slowly gets to his feet, still refusing to die.

               Loomis stops and takes aim. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!

               Michael is hit three times, each bullet throwing him 
               backward further down the hall until he hits the window at 
               the end and SMASHES through it.

               EXT. DOYLE HOUSE -- UP ANGLE

               Michael falls from the second story right down into CAMERA 
               with a CRASH!  

               ANGLE IN HALL

               Loomis rushes to Laurie and bends down beside her. For a 
               moment she just cries in his arms, sobbing hysterically.

               Then she looks up at him with a glazed, wild expression.  

                                     LAURIE
                         It was the Boogeyman...

               Loomis looks down at her, then up at the shattered window 
               at the end of the hall.

                                     LOOMIS
                         As a matter of fact it was.

               He walks slowly down to the window and peers out.

               LOOMIS' POV -- BACKYARD

               He looks down at the spot where Michael should be, but 
               there is nothing there, just a trampled patch in the grass.

               ANGLE ON LOOMIS

               He stares down with a growing fear, then looks out from 
               the house.

               LOOMIS' POV

               The backyard, the neighboring yards, the street, all are 
               empty, quiet, dark. There is only the SOUND of the wind 
               swelling in the trees.

               Michael is gone.

               FADE TO BLACK.

               ROLL END TITLES.

                                        THE END

                      A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET












1A.   INT.  (MONTAGE).                                                   1A.

      NIGHTMARE MUSIC THEME begins as we FADE UP on a SERIES OF SHOTS,
      all CLOSE and teasing.

              -- A man's FEET, in shabby work shoes, stalking
                 through a junk bin in a dark, fire-lit, ash-
                 dusted place.  A huge BOILER ROOM is what it
                 is, although we only glimpse it piecemeal.
                 Then we SEE a MAN'S HAND, dirty and nail-bitten,
                 reach INTO FRAME and pick up a piece of METAL.

              -- ANOTHER ANGLE as the HAND grabs a grimey
                 WORKGLOVE and slashes at it with a straight
                 razor, until its fingertips are off.

              -- CLOSE ON SAME HANDS dumping four fishing knives
                 out of a filthy bag.  Their blades are thin,
                 curved, gleaming sharp.

              -- MORE ANGLES, EVEN CLOSER.  We can HEAR the MAN's
                 wheezing BREATHING, but we still haven't seen
                 his face.  We never will.  We just SEE more metal
                 being assembled with crude tools, into some sort
                 of linkage -- a splayed, spidery sort of apparatus,
                 against a background light of FIRE, and a deep
                 rushing of STEAM and HEAVY, DARK ENERGY.

              -- And then we see this linkage attached to the glove.

              -- Then the BLADES attached to all of it.

              -- Then the MAN'S HAND slips into this glove-like
                 apparatus, filling it out and transforming
                 it into an awesome, deadly claw-hand with
                 four razor/talons gleaming at its blackened
                 fingertips.  Suddenly the HAND arches and STRIKES
                 FORWARD, SLASHING THROUGH a DARK CANVAS, tearing
                 it to shreds.


1.    EXT.  LOS ANGELES.  NIGHT.  (2nd Unit)                             1.

      A PULSATION OF LIGHT AND SHADOW.  MUSIC DROPS AWAY to a hushed
      RUSHING OF WIND and DISTANT SIRENS.  CAMERA RACKS INTO FOCUS on a
      HIGH PANORAMA of the San Fernando Valley, its night sky lit from
      within by a strange GREENISH LIGHT.  TITLES BEGIN.

      CAMERA TILTS DOWN and ZOOMS SWIFTLY into the valley's web of
      light.

                                                CUT TO:

     
2.    INT.  CONCRETE PASSAGEWAY.                                         2.

      TITLES CONTINUE as TINA GRAY, a strong girl of fifteen in a thin
      night shift, moves towards us down a dark concrete corridor.  Her
      steps quicken as TITLES appear in the portion of frame she leaves
      free.

      A subliminal COLLAGE of SOUND threads in and out of the MUSIC.
      Distant insane LAUGHTER.  Slamming iron DOORS.  A bleating animal
      CRY.  A LAMB, white and blank-faced, skitters across her path and
      on into the dark.  No reason why it's there.

      Then another SOUND, much nearer -- the slithering SCRAPE of
      something like fingernails across slate.  It sets our teeth on
      edge, twists the MUSIC, and sends TINA running.


3.    INT.  BOILER ROOM.                                                 3.

      Suddenly TINA's a tiny figure running among huge boilers steam
      pipes and catwalks -- a shadowed forest of iron and stone.  She
      stops, listening intently as the SOUND of tiny hooves suddenly
      turns into the rattle of DISTANT RAIN.

      Then she hears RIPPING FABRIC.

      Someone is shouldering behind a ragged screen of dirty canvas,
      approaching TINA.

      CLOSER ON THE CANVAS.  The long curved fingerblades suddenly
      punch through, flashing in the firelight, and begin ripping
      through the thick fabric, as easily as scalpels through flesh.
      They make a hideous, extended RIPPING SOUND.

      TINA rushes away, hands over her ears.

      ANOTHER ANGLE -- as the blinded girl stumbles backwards.  Then
      the canvas flaps free.  The blades are gone.  The TITLES END, and
      everything goes silent.

      CAMERA CIRCLES until TINA's looking right into our eyes.  The
      light from a nearby boiler pours through her thin night dress,
      leaving her naked and vulnerable.  Then a deep, ragged VOICE
      whispers at her as CAMERA CLOSES IN ON HER FACE.

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                      One two, Freddie's coming for
                      you...

      TINA opens her mouth to scream but only a dry, yellow dust pours
      out.  And at that precise moment a huge shadowy MAN with a grimey
      red and yellow sweater and a weird hat pulled over his scarred
      face lunges at her.  And it's his fingers that are tipped with
      the long blades of steel, glinting in the boney light and giving
      the hulk the look of an otherworldly predator.

      TINA dodges away, her legs suddenly elephantine and slow.  The
      MAN seizes the trailing hem of her nightgown and hauls her back.

      The MUSIC shrieks as TINA manages to tear free -- the MAN lurches
      after her with a hoarse SHOUT as we --

                                              SMASH CUT TO:


4.    INT.  TINA'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                      4.

      TINA convulses in bed with a SCREAM, looking around wildly.
      Someone is KNOCKING on her door.

                                      WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                      You okay, Tina?

      TINA'S MOTHER sticks her head in with a worried look.  TINA sits
      up and blows out a breath, groggy.

                                      TINA
                      Just a dream, Ma...
                              (more to herself)
                      Damn dream, is all...

      The woman, once attractive, ventures a step into the room.  A MAN
      hovers BACKGROUND.  TINA'S mother waves him away without looking,
      shoving a strand of bleached hair from her eyes.  She appraises
      her daughter.

                                      TINA'S MOTHER
                      Some dream, judging from that.

      She nods at TINA's nightshift.

      TINA looks down at her nightgown, only now aware of the chill
      penetrating it from the room.  There are four long slashes up its
      middle, cleanly cut as if by scalpels.

                                      MAN (OS)
                              (distant, annoyed)
                      You coming back to the sack or
                      what?

                                      TINA'S MOTHER
                      Hold your horses.
                              (lower, to Tina as she
                               stands to leave)
                      You gotta cut your nails or stop
                      that kind of dreaming, Tina.  One
                      or the other.

      The woman shuts the door behind her.  TINA looks back to her
      nightgown.

                                      TINA
                              (low)
                      Oh, shit.

      She suddenly snatches up the cross that hangs over her head, her
      face white as her sheet.

                                              FADE TO BLACK

                                              BURN ON

5.                            THE FIRST DAY                              5.

                                      CHILDREN (OS)
                              (singing)
                      One two, Freddie's coming for you...
                      Three four better lock your door
                      Five six grab your crucifix...


6.    EXT.  HIGH SCHOOL.  DAY.                                           6.

      FADE UP ON SHOT OF this large highschool and its crowds of
      STUDENTS.  FOREGROUND, TINA climbs out of a cherry-red 1959
      Cadillac convertible with two other students, best friend NANCY
      WILSON, and Nancy's boyfriend and owner of the car, GLEN LANTZ.

      FOREGROUND several GRADESCHOOLERS are playing jump-rope, and the
      old ditty they sing continues unbroken from TINA's bedroom.

                                      ROPE JUMPERS
                      Seven eight, gonna stay up late!
                      Nine ten -- never sleep again!

7.    MOVING ANGLE FAVORING NANCY.  She's a pretty girl in a letter      7.
      sweater, with an easy, athletic stride and the look of a natural
      leader.  GLEN, holding her hand, wears one of the school's
      football jerseys; a good-natured, bright kid.  Tina's in
      mid-conversation.

                                      TINA
                              (referring to kids' song)
                      That's what it reminded me of --
                      that old jump rope song.
                              (shudders)
                      Worst nightmare I ever had.
                      You wouldn't believe it.

      Nancy nods.

                                      NANCY
                      Matter of fact I had a bad dream
                      last night myself...

      TINA turns to NANCY, but before either can say more, ROD LANE, a
      lean, Richard Gere sort in black leather and New Wave studs joins
      up with them and interupts.

                                      ROD
                              (to Tina)
                      Had a hardon this morning when
                      I woke up, Tina.  Had your name
                      written all over it.

      Tina cracks her gum with a look of withering indifference.

                                      TINA
                      There's four letters in my name,
                      Rod.  How could there be room
                      on your joint for four letters?

      The guy's stopped in his tracks.

                                      ROD
                      Hey, up yours with a twirling lawn
                      mower!

      He cuts off across the lawn.

                                      TINA
                      Rod says the sweetest things.

                                      NANCY
                      He's nuts about you.

                                      TINA
                      Yeah, nuts.

      TINA makes a face and rakes her fingernails across a tree as she
      passes.

                                      TINA (CONTD)
                              (yawns)
                      Anyway, I'm too tired to worry
                      about the creep.  Couldn't get
                      back to sleep at all.
                              (beat)
                      So what you dream?

                                      NANCY
                      Forget it, the point is, every-
                      body has nightmares once in a while.
                      No biggy.

                                      GLEN
                      Next time you have one, just
                      tell yourself that's just all
                      it is, right while you're having
                      it, y'know?  That's the trick.
                      Once you do that, you wake right
                      up.  At least it works for me.

      TINA looks at GLEN sharply.  He kisses NANCY and darts off for
      class.

                                      TINA
                      Hey!  You have a nightmare too?

      But GLEN's gone.

                                      TINA (CONTD)
                      Maybe we're gonna have the Big
                      Earthquake.  They say things get
                      weird just before that...

      BELLS ARE RINGING, and STUDENTS crowding; TINA and NANCY are
      drawn into the crush.

                                              FADE TO BLACK


8.    EXT.  A VALLEY STREET.  NIGHT.                                     8.

      ANGLE ON A MODEST HOME; no car, just a couple of BIKES in the
      drive.  Every light in the house and yard is turned on.  We HEAR
      the rock group MADNESS played at a 'No adults home' volume.


9.    INT.  TINA'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  9.

      ON GLEN, dialing.  Nancy and TINA are watching, giggling.

                                      TINA
                      I can't believe his mother let him
                      come over here.

                                      NANCY
                      Right.  Well, she didn't, exactly...

      GLEN shoves a cassette into TINA's Ghetto Blaster.

                                      GLEN
                              (to TINA)
                      See, I got this cousin who lives
                      near the airport, that it's okay
                      for me to stay with, right?  So I
                      found this sound effects tape at
                      Licorice Pizza, and...

      The phone is answered.  GLEN jerks the tone arm off the record
      with a SCRUUPT!!

                                      GLEN (CONTD)
                      Hello, Mom?
                              (pushes the 'play' button)
                      Yeah, out here at Barry's.

      A JET PLANE begins to make itself heard on the tape.  GLEN moves
      the machine closer to the phone.  It's a big plane -- sounds like
      a 747 coming in for a landing.

                                      GLEN (CONT)
                      Huh?  Yeah, noisy as usual.  Glad
                      we don't live here -- huh?  Yeah,
                      Aunt Eunice says hello.

      The Jet is SCREAMING IN now, full flaps and howling like a
      monstrous banshee.  NANCY and TINA dissolve into muffled
      giggles.

                                      GLEN (CONT)
                              (shouting over the din)
                      Right, right -- I'll call you in the
                      morning!  Right!  Huh?  Yeah, sure,
                      I, huh?...

      Suddenly the tape goes silent.  GLEN blanches.  Next moment
      another ENGINE is heard, but this one is a FORD LOTUS screaming
      by at 180 mph.

                                      GLEN (CONT)
                              (reacting to his mother's
                               reaction)
                      Uh... some kid's drag racing
                      outside, I think...

      The sound effect changes abruptly to a SPEEDING SEDAN -- and the
      ages-old SCREECH of BRAKES, last-second SCREAM and horrible
      COLLISION.  NANCY gamely tries to find the right button to turn
      it off, but misses.  There's a loud SCREEK of fast-forward mayhem
      -- Glen improvises desperately.

                                      GLEN (CONT)
                      Listen, Mom, I got to go -- I
                      think there's been an accident out
                      front -- I --

      NANCY jumps back from the cassette player -- WORLD WAR II bursts
      out at top volume -- MACHINE GUNS, HAND GRENADES, DIVING BEARCATS
      and SHOUTS of charging Huns.  GLEN makes a last-ditch dive and
      flings the cassette out of the machine.

      Blessed silence at last.

                                      GLEN (CONT)
                      Right.  I'll call the police.  No,
                      just some neighbors having a fight,
                      I guess.  I'm fine, I'm fine!
                      Call you in the morning!

      He hangs up and sags back.

                                      NANCY
                      Worked like a charm.

                                      GLEN
                      Jesus.

      TINA shoves another cassette in, and MICHAEL JACKSON'S 'THRILLER'
      blasts from the STEREO.  The kids relax, the CAMERA GLIDES PAST
      THEM TO THE WINDOW.

      The WIND is moving the bare TREE BRANCH outside.  CAMERA PANS
      BACK to the comfortably threadbare room, uneasy.  We see NANCY
      poking at a flame in the hearth as TINA comes FOREGROUND to draw
      the drapes.

                                      NANCY
                      Nice to have a fire.

                                      TINA
                      Really.  Turn 'er up a little.

      NANCY turns a nearby valve handle, and the gas fire climbs
      brightly over its artificial log.  TINA joins her, heartened.

                                      NANCY
                      Maybe we should call Rod, have him
                      come over too.  He might get jealous.

                                      TINA
                      Rod and I are done.  He's too much
                      of a maniac.

                                      GLEN
                      He should join the Marines, they
                      could make something out of him.
                      Like a hand grenade.

      TINA laughs despite herself.  NANCY brightens.

                                      NANCY
                      See?  You've forgotten the bad
                      dream.  Didn't I tell you?

      TINA shakes her head, wishing she had forgotten.

                                      TINA
                      All day long I been seeing that
                      guy's weird face, and hearing
                      those fingernails...

      NANCY looks up with a flinch.

                                      NANCY
                      Fingernails?
                              (blinks, laughing)
                      That's amazing, you saying that.
                      It made me remember the dream I
                      had last night.

      TINA looks up.

                                      TINA
                      What you dream?

                                      NANCY
                      I dreamed about this guy in a
                      dirty red and yellow sweater;
                      I dream in color, y'know; he
                      walked into the room I was in,
                      right, right through the wall,
                      like it was smoke or something,
                      and just stared at me.  Sort of
                      ...obscenely.  Then he walked
                      out through the wall on the
                      other side.  Like he'd just
                      come to check me out...

      The story has left the room deathly quiet.  Especially TINA seems
      effected.

                                     TINA
                              (quietly)
                      So what about the fingernails?

      NANCY remembers, imitating the frightful coincidence.

                                      NANCY
                      He scraped his fingernails
                      along things -- actually, they
                      were more like fingerknives or
                      something, like he'd made them
                      himself?  Anyway, they made
                      this horrible nose --
                              (imitates)
                      sssssccrrrtttt....

      TINA pales.

                                      TINA
                      Nancy.  You dreamed about the
                      same creep I did, Nancy...

      The girls stare at each other.

                                      GLEN
                      That's impossible.

      They look at him.  He looks away, as if suddenly listening.

                                      TINA
                      What?

                                      GLEN
                      Nothing.

                                      TINA
                      There's somebody out there,
                      isn't there...

                                      NANCY
                      I didn't hear anything...

      Then there's an unmistakeable SOUND.  A distinct SCRAPING against
      the house, just outside the window.  Something multiple, thin and
      sharp.  Something like metal fingernails.  NANCY's mouth opens a
      fraction of an inch.


10.   EXT.  FRONT OF HOUSE.  NIGHT.                                      10.

      CLOSE ON FRONT DOOR as a BOLT UNLOCKS, a KEY TURNS, a CHAIN is
      REMOVED.  At last the door swings open and GLEN swaggers out.

                                      GLEN
                      I'm gonna punch out your ugly
                      lights, whoever you are.

      No answer but a slight RUSTLE in the bushes.  GLEN does a 180 and
      walks right back inside.  The girls prod him right back out,
      giddy with giggling fear.

                                      GLEN
                      It's just a stupid cat.

                                      NANCY
                      Then bring us back its tail
                      and whiskers.

      The girls push him farther.  GLEN edges towards the shadows.
      Then the SCRITCHING again.  GLEN stops; TINA edges back into the
      house.

                                      TINA
                      Anyway, I don't have a cat...

      ANGLE INTO THE SHADOWS.  Turned from the girls, GLEN sobers,
      listening.  IN HIS POV we see the street.  Silent houses.
      Motionless trees on empty lawns.

                                      GLEN
                      Kitty-kitty?  Chow chow chow?

      Not a living, or dead, soul.  GLEN turns back to the girls with a
      shrug.  Instantly, a large FIGURE pounces and throws him to the
      ground with a shout.

      The girls SCREAM in panic and run for the house.

11.   REVERSE -- ROD leaps up and shouts like a sportscaster --          11.

                                      ROD
                      And it's number thirty-six, Rod
                      Lane, bringing Lantz down just
                      three yards from the goal with a
                      brilliant tackle!  And the fans
                      go wild!

      ROD dances into the light, flashing a wild gypsy's grin at TINA.
      The girl's relieved and frightened at the same time.

                                      TINA
                      What the hell you doing here?

                                      ROD
                      Came to make up, no big deal.
                      Your ma home?

                                      TINA
                      Of course.  What's that?

      ROD takes the spindly hand rake he's found and scraps the house's
      wall.  It makes a terrible SCRIIITCHING SOUND.  He grins and
      tosses it aside.

                                      ROD
                      Intense, huh?
                              (sizes up the three)
                      So what's happening, an orgy or
                      something?

                                      GLEN
                      Maybe a funeral, you dickhead.

      ROD wheels, a knife suddenly in his hand, as if ready to take
      Glen's throat out.  NANCY breaks between --

                                      NANCY
                      -- Just a sleep-over date, Rod.
                      Just Tina and me.  Glen was just
                      leaving.

      ROD eyes GLEN, laughs and flips the knife closed and away,
      putting his arm around TINA's shoulder and laughing as if it's
      all a great joke.

                                      ROD
                      You see his face?
                              (lower)
                      Your ma ain't home, is she?
                              (to Nancy & Glen)
                      Me and Tina got stuff to discuss.

      He pulls TINA inside without further ceremony.

                                      NANCY
                      Rod...

      But ROD's already got himself and TINA halfway through the living
      room, heading into the darker part of the house.

                                      ROD
                      We got her mother's bed.
                      You two got the rest.

      ANGLE BACK ON GLEN AND NANCY.

                                      NANCY
                      We should get her out of here...

      TINA darts to the front door, her blouse half out.

                                      TINA
                      Hey -- you guys're hanging around --
                      right?
                              (fake laughing/whine)
                      Don't leave me alone with this
                      lunatic -- Pleeeeze, NANCY!

      She disappears.  GLEN looks at NANCY.  Too innocent.

                                      GLEN
                      So we'll guard her together.
                      Through the night.
                              (moving closer)
                      In each others' arms like
                      we always said.

                                      NANCY
                      Glen.  Not now.  I mean,
                      we're here for Tina now,
                      not for ourselves.

      She kisses him lightly, then pushes him back.

                                      GLEN
                              (frustrated)
                      Why's she so bothered by a
                      stupid nightmare, anyway?

                                     NANCY
                      Because he was scary, that's
                      why.

                                     GLEN
                      Who was scary?

      NANCY turns and looks at him.

                                     NANCY
                      Don't you think it's weird, her
                      and me dreaming about the same
                      guy?
                              (GLEN looks away;
                               NANCY stares closer)
                      You didn't have a bad dream
                      last night, did you?

      GLEN gives her a funny look.

                                      GLEN
                      Me?  I don't dream.

      He takes her inside.  Over the SOUNDS of locks falling shut we

                                              FADE TO BLACK


13.   INT.  TINA'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  13.

      FADE UP ON an old 50's CLOCK, one of those set into the black
      plaster body of a stalking panther.  It's just past 2 AM.

      PAN the cold hearth and darkened living room to REVEAL GLEN on
      the couch, cacooned in sheets.  He's listening miserably to the
      SOUNDS OF LOVEMAKING coming from the next room.  TINA peaks, ROD
      howls.  Then silence.

                                      GLEN
                      Morality sucks.

                                                      CUT TO:


14.   INT.  TINA'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                             14.

      This is a slightly larger room than TINA's.  Adult.  Female.
      Spare in its appointments.  The streetlight throws the narrow bed
      into broken shadow and light.  TINA AND ROD lie in each other's
      arms in the middle of the big bed.  Satiated.

                                      TINA
                      I knew there was sometihng
                      about you I liked...

      ROD yawns into the pillows, happy.

                                      ROD
                      You feel better now, right?

                                      TINA
                      Jungle man fix Jane.

                                      ROD
                      No more fights?

                                      TINA
                      No more fights.

                                      ROD
                              (sleepily)
                      Good.  No more nightmares for
                      either of us then.

      He pulls the covers over his head.  He's almost out already.

                                      TINA
                              (beat)
                      When did you have a nightmare?

                                      ROD
                              (under the blankets)
                      Guys can have nightmares too,
                      y'know.  You ain't got a corner
                      on the fucking market or something.

      He rolls over, practically snoring, and pulls another cover over
      his head.  A dirty red and yellow cover.

                                      TINA
                              (sleepily)
                      Where'd you get this snotty old
                      thing?

      SNORES from ROD.  TINA yawns, turns off the light and snuggles
      against ROD, pulling the cover gingerly over herself, too.


15.   INT.  TINA'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT                                       15.

      CAMERA MOVES across the room of the original nightmare to find
      NANCY alone in TINA's bed, staring at the slanting ceiling above
      the bed.  Thinking.  We can just hear her HEART beating.  She
      sighs and turns on her side.

      Immediately the wall above her head turns a faint reddish hue,
      with a broad yellow smear across its center.  All unseen by
      NANCY, the wall begins to pulse in exact time with her heart's
      beat.

      CLOSE ON NANCY'S FACE.  She closes her eyes.

      ANGLE BACK UP ON THE CEILING JUST ABOVE HER HEAD.  SOMETHING
      presses against the surface from the inside.  The plaster buldges
      out as if suddenly elastic, taking the shape of the thing
      pressing from inside -- taking the shape of a man's face.  The
      face opens its mouth.  The knives rake through the surface.

      ANGLE ON NANCY -- as plaster dust snows down on her.

      She jerks awake, sitting bolt upright.  The face retracts
      suddenly -- the wall is normal.

      ANGLE DOWN ON NANCY as she looks up to the ceiling, touching her
      hair and feeling the plaster dust.

      REVERSE IN HER POV TO THE CEILING.  There are three parallel cuts
      in the plaster there.  About eight inches long.  As if cut by
      sharp knives.  Nothing else.

      Back on NANCY.  She draws the covers around her and shivers.
      Eyes wide open.


16.   EXT.  TINA'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.                                        16.

      Not a car or person in sight.  A stricken breeze dies in the
      trees.

17.   ZOOM IN on the window of the room where TINA sleeps.  By the time  17.
      we're FULL IN CLOSE on it, the air is again still as death.  A
      moment later a PEBBLE bounces off the pane.  The NIGHTMARE THEME
      appears in the lower registers and holds its breath.

      Another PEBBLE strikes, with a sharper RAP.


18.   INT.  TINA'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                             18.

      CLOSE ON TINA'S FACE as her eyes open.

19.   REVERSE IN HER POV.  Another PEBBLE clatters off the glass.        19.

20.   TINA raises slowly.                                                20.

                                      TINA
                      ROD...

      SNORES FROM ROD.  TINA sits up.

      PAST HER TO THE WINDOW.  The WIND MOVES AGAIN; the trees brush
      the window with their shadows.  Then another pebble.  RAP!  TINA
      slips to the window.


21.   EXT.  TINA'S BACKYARD.  NIGHT.                                     21.

      She looks out on an old yard with a patch of bananna trees
      rattling in the Santa Ana winds.  It seems deserted, though the
      welling dark won't let her be sure.  Then another pebble -- PAP!

      -- hitting with a sharp RACK FOCUS.

22.   A LOW ANGLE TO WINDOW as TINA jumps back, startled.  She hadn't    22.
      seen that one coming.  But she's drawn back to the glass out of
      curiousity, straining to see in the dark.  It's as if the stones
      are materializing out of thin air.


23.   INT.  TINA'S MOTHER'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                23.

      WHAP!  This time a heavier stone, and a thin crack bristles
      across the glass.

                                      TINA
                              (low)
                      Who the fuck you think you are,
                      whoever you are?


24.   EXT.  TINA'S BACK YARD.  NIGHT.                                    24.

      WIDE ANGLE ON THE REAR OF THE HOUSE.  A LIGHT COMES ON.  TINA
      appears in the doorway.

                                      TINA
                              (listening)
                      Somebody there?

      She can see through the backward to a yawning gate and the back
      alley.  No one there.  But a word is spoken, as if by wind.

                                      VOICE
                              (garbled)
                      Tina.

      TINA straightens, unable to swallow.  There's a ragged, obscene
      GIGGLE.  Deep in the throat.  Phlegmy.

                                      TINA
                      Who the hell is that?

      TINA charges across the yard and through the gate, the MUSIC
      chasing after.


25.   EXT.  A SERVICE ALLEY.  NIGHT.                                     25.

      She brakes in the middle of the alley and whirls around.
      Listening.  Shivering in the same thin slashed nightgown.

      A sharp crank of METAL, and fifty feet down the alley the lid of
      an ash can rolls from the dark like a huge tin coin and spirals
      noisily down.

26.   LOW REVERSE ACROSS LID TO TINA.  Despite herself she comes over    26.
      and touches it.  She comes up with long worms on her fingers.

      Next moment the exact same shambling MAN from her nightmare
      staggers into view fifty feet behind her.  TINA falls back into
      the shadows, shaking the worms off her fingers in repulsion.  The
      MAN turns and starts directly for her, something shining on his
      right hand as he spreads his arms wide.  He starts scraping the
      steel FINGERNAILS along a cinderblock wall.  Orange sparks spurt
      out -- his arms elongate until they reach from one side of the
      alley to the other -- and TINA is cut off from her home!

      CLOSE ON HER as the SCRAPING of the blades gets louder and
      closer.  She begins to shake uncontrollably.

                                      TINA
                      Oh, shit, please God...

                                      KILLER
                              (softly, approaching)
                      This is God...

      He holds up his steel-tipped hand like a surgical-steel spider.
      TINA runs for her life.

27.   WIDER ANGLE IN THE ALLEY -- a terrifying, all-out footrace         27.
      between the girl and her pursuer.  The MAN is fast; the distance
      between them closes with each heartbeat.  TINA overturns ashcans
      -- claws her way through a rotten back fence, hammers against a
      window.  Ashen FACES appear, recoil, pull curtains closed and
      disappear in fright.


28.   EXT.  TINA'S STREET.  NIGHT.                                       28.

      TINA runs out onto front lawns, SCREAMING for help.  No help
      comes.  In fact, the only response is for all the porch lights on
      the block to be turned off.  The MAN roars out from behind a tree
      -- a tree too narrow to have hidden him -- nearly upon the girl!
      TINA runs in panic -- at last making her own home, only to be
      trapped against its locked front door.

      She hammers against its thick wood.

                                      TINA
                      Nancy!  Open the door -- Nancy!

      The MAN slows.  He has TINA now and knows it.

                                      MAN
                      She's still awake.  Nancy can't
                      hear you.

      TINA turns and looks full at the approaching MAN.  Smudged by
      deep shadow, he's big and hideous.  He wears the same dirty
      yellow sweater from the first nightmare -- from the wall-hanging
      and blanket too -- and has the same sagging hat and leering grin
      over his misshapen face.  And on his fingers are the steel
      talons.

29.   CLOSE ON HIM as he takes the blade on the end of his right index   29.
      finger and lopes off one of the fingers of his left hand.  Then
      another.  We SEE the PIECES OF FINGERS fall past TINA'S face in
      SLOW MOTION.

      ANGLE ON THE GROUND of the FINGERS squirming on the ground, one
      flopping onto TINA's naked foot.

      TINA leaps back, sickened, and begins stamping on then as if they
      were huge bugs.

      The MAN snaps up his arm and the FINGERS fly back into place on
      his hand.  He leers at TINA -- then suddenly lunges at her,
      sweeping with his cutting hand!

      TINA's no weak sister -- blocks his arm, deflecting the spines,
      and grabs the MAN's ugly face with her other hand.  But the face
      only slides off to the bone.  The MAN presses in, and TINA
      contorts in horror as the knives slash across her shoulder --
      cutting her deeply.

29A.  TINA staggers backward, GROANING, her foot now inexplicably        29A.
      caught in bedclothes!  She falls over her bed's conformter, twists
      away from the man and, like a child, pulls the cover over her!
      The skull-faced MAN crushes down, and there's a fierce grappling
      -- punctuated by his GRUNTS and the girl's DEAFENING SCREAMS --
      and they both become totally wrapped in the comforter -- until
      they're beneath it, fighting for life and death.


30.   INT.  TINA'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                      30.

      ROD lurches up into CLOSE UP in the lightless bedroom,
      half-awakened by the tremendous struggle somewhere, somehow
      inside the dark bed.  ROD grabs groggily, lifting the blanket.

30A.  IN HIS POV we glimpse the dark underside of the blanket -- see     30A.
      TWO SHADOWY FIGURES flailing and clawing under the bedspread --
      TINA and the MAN -- or a shape that could be a man -- raging
      against each other.

      ROD drops the blanket and leaps from the bed, scared full awake
      and terrified.  Then the horrible TINA's GASPS change to the
      CRIES of a terribly wounded victim.  ROD instantly jerks back the
      bedspread.

      IN HIS POV we SEE TINA struggling and flailing along on the
      sheets, the MAN nowhere in sight.

                                      ROD
                      T-tina!?

      Suddenly TINA -- eyes turned inward to her tormentor -- give an
      awful jolt -- her arms and legs are spraddled as if by
      overwhelming force and pinned to the bed.  Next instant, her
      nightgown flies apart and four long gashes chase across her
      torso.  From no visible instruments!  A huge irrigation of blood
      floods the bed.

      Terrified, ROD dives for the light -- but at the same moment
      something invisible grabs TINA, wielding her body in the air and
      bringing it around in a swift blow that knocks ROD crashing into
      the light -- smashing it to bits.

31.   CLOSER ON HIM as he struggles around.  In the blue FLASHES OF      31.
      ELECTRICITY ROD sees TINA sliding up the bedroom wall in a dark
      smear, dragged feet first!

      ANGLE ON ROD -- paralized by terror!

      ANGLE ON TINA'S DYING EYES -- moving with her up the wall and
      bumping around the corner onto the ceiling.  She's just looking
      at who's dragging her, eyes glazing.

      REVERSE IN HER POV -- to the shadowy, horrendously ugly MAN,
      dragging her with fierce glee across the ceiling, literally
      swabbing the ceiling with her bloody body.  SEEN in FORCED
      PERSPECTIVE, the SHOT carries her across a great distance without
      seeming to get anywhere -- as if the ceiling is an endless
      plane.

      ANGLE DOWN ON ROD -- on his hands and knees -- the lamp next to
      him blurting blue SPARKS and STROBING the nightmare room.  ROD'S
      screaming up at TINA'S invisible tormentor.

                                      ROD
                      What the hell's going ON here!
                      Tina!

      ANGLE ON TINA -- upside down, clawing at the hanging swag lamp
      above her mother's dressing table -- desperate for some anchor.
      But she's dragged away from it.  The lamp swings back, it's wires
      gushing more SPARKS.

      CLOSER along the ceiling as TINA rakes a long furrow in the
      ceiling with her fingernails.  But her eyes are glazing,
      glazing.  And then they fall closed.

      WIDE, UP ON THE CEILING, as her body suddenly flops loose,
      hanging for an awful moment by the feet over the bed.

      REVERSE ON ROD -- staring like a terrified child.

                                      ROD
                      Tina --

      REVERSE IN HIS POV -- as the body falls like a sack of rocks onto
      the devastated bed, in SLOW MOTION, striking with a huge splash
      of blood.  A sick, awful GIGGLE floats around the room, then
      ECHOES off into infinity.  ROD staggers up, staring around as if
      hoping to see this phantom.

                                      ROD
                      You motherfucker!  I'll kill you
                      for that!


32.   INT.  TINA'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                      32.

      NANCY is sitting straight up in bed, terrified.  The CRIES of ROD
      are ringing through the whole house.  She forces herself to move
      -- bolting from the bed despite her terror and sense of dread.


33.   INT.  HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                                             33.

      NANCY flies into the dark hall -- crashing directly into SOMEONE
      who lurches out of the dark before her.  She SCREAMS and jumps
      back --

                                      GLEN
                      What the hell's going on!?

                                      NANCY
                      Oh -- jeez -- Glen!  Rod's
                      gone ape!

                                      ROD (OS)
                              (sobbing)
                      I'll kill you!

      NANCY grabs the door; it's locked; she pounds on it.  BAM! BAM!
      BAM!

      Things fall into sudden, awful silence on the other side.  GLEN's
      voice cracks with fear.

                                      GLEN
                      Rod?
                              (silence)
                      Rod, you better not hurt Tina...

      ROD erupts into terrible HOARSE LAUGHTER AND SOBBING.  Then they
      hear BREAKING GLASS.

      GLEN barrels into the door like the football player he is.  The
      frame splinters and they're in.


34.   INT.  TINA'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                             34.

      Just inside the door NANCY slips and goes down hard.  GLEN finds
      her in the dark more by touch than sight.

                                      GLEN
                      You okay?

                                      NANCY
                      Yeah.  Something slippering all
                      over here...
                              (feeling)
                      Tina?

      No answer.  The room is quiet as a tomb.  Except for a stead
      DRIPPING, from all over.  Then GLEN finds a LIGHT SWITCH.

      On the CLICK the devastation is revealed.  There's BLOOD
      everywhere: up the walls, over the clawed ceiling, soaking the
      killing floor of the bed, and pooling in the dark red puddle
      where NANCY has slipped and fallen.

                                      GLEN
                      Oh, shit...

      NANCY wobbles up and sees TINA in the center of the ravaged bed.
      Unmistakeably and utterly dead.  NANCY presses against the wall,
      then contorts and chokes.

                                      GLEN (CONTD)
                              (numb)
                      I...I'm gonna call the cops --

      He bursts from the room.

35.   TIGHT ON NANCY.  She turns away from the body in repulsion,        35.
      sticking her head through the shattered window ROD LANE used for
      his escape, sucking in the cold night air and moaning.

                                              FADE TO BLACK


36.   EXT/INT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                  36.

      FADE UP ON RED LIGHTS and SIREN as an unmarked POLICE CAR speeds
      to the curb.

      LT DON THOMPSON, a decent-looking man in his mid-40's, exits and
      punches a cigarette from his pack.  His shaken aide, a uniformed
      patrolman named PARKER, greets him.  (CAMERA FOLLOWS them from
      the car straight into the station and eventually to THOMPSON'S
      OFFICE.)

                                      PARKER
                      Lieutenant Thompson.  Sorry to
                      wake you, but --

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      I'd've canned your ass if you
                      hadn't.  What you got?

      PARKER stumbles to open the door for THOMPSON as the man bulls
      into the station at a furious pace.

                                      PARKER
                      Her name was Tina Gray.  It
                      was her home.  Father abandoned
                      ten years ago, mother's in
                      Vegas with a boyfriend.  We're
                      trying to reach her now.

      LT THOMPSON grimaces as if he knows the story.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      What's the Coroner got to say?

                                      PARKER
                      Something like a razor was
                      the weapon, but nothing
                      found on the scene.

      THOMPSON is already to the desk officer SERGEANT GARCIA.  The big
      MAN shoves him a sheaf of papers --

                                      SERGEANT GARCIA
                              (wary)
                      Leautenant.  You know who --

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Where is she?

                                      SERGEANT GARCIA
                      I put her in your office...

      PARKER scurries after.

                                      PARKER
                      Looks like her boyfriend did
                      it.  Rod Lane.  Musician type,
                      arrests for brawling, dope --

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Terrific.  What the hell was
                      she doing there?

                                      PARKER
                      She lived there.

                                      LT THOMPSON
OMIT 37.              I don't mean her --                           OMIT 37.

38.   INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  38.

      THOMPSON enters his office and confronts NANCY and her mother,
      MARGE SIMSON.

                                      LT THOMPSON (CONTD)
                      I mean you.
                              (accusingly, to Marge)
                      What the hell was she doing there?

      MARGE SIMSON is in her middle thirties; a good-looking woman
      despite the hour and circumstances.

                                      MARGE
                      Hello to you, too, Donald.

      THOMPSON stops, the steam suddenly out of him.  The girl is a
      wreck and he winces to see it.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Marge.

      THOMPSON glances at PARKER and the other UNIFORMED COPS who are
      in the room.  As a man they head for the door.  There's no
      question who the boss is here.  THOMPSON turns to NANCY.  She
      fumbles a smile.

                                      LT THOMPSON (CONTD)
                      How you doing, pal?

                                      NANCY
                      Okay.  Hi, dad.

      NANCY's dress is dark with dried blood, her skin clammy and the
      color of paste.  MARGE shoots her ex-husband a worried glance.
      THOMPSON pulls a chair close to NANCY.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      I don't want to get into this now,
                      god knows you need time.
                              (hotter)
                      But I'd sure would like to know
                      what the hell you were doing
                      shacked up with three other kids
                      in the middle of the night --
                      especially a delinquent lunatic
                      like Lane.

      NANCY weaves.

                                      NANCY
                      Rod's not a lunatic.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      You got a sane explanation for
                      what he did?

      The girl is shredding a Kleenex, staring off.

                                      MARGE
                      Apparantly he was crazy jealous.
                      Nancy said they'd had a fight,
                      Rod and Tina.

                                      NANCY
                              (quietly)
                      It wasn't that serious...

                                      MARGE
                      Maybe you don't think murder's
                      serious --

      NANCY sits bolt upright in her chair, her eyes flashing.

                                      NANCY
                      She was my best friend!  Don't
                      you dare say I don't take her
                      death seriously!
                              (lower, near tears)
                      I just meant their fights
                      weren't that serious.

      The girl holds the woman's eyes a moment, then looks away.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                              (to herself)
                      She dreamed this would happen...

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      What?

                                      NANCY
                      She had a nightmare about somebody
                      trying to kill her, last night.
                      That's why we were there; she was
                      afraid to sleep alone.

      A tear splashes off the arm of her chair.

                                      MARGE
                      She's been through enough for one
                      night.  You have her statement.

      The mother and daughter rise; THOMPSON raps on the door and
      PARKER opens it.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                              (to MARGE)
                      I suggest you keep a little better
                      track on her -- she's still a kid,
                      y'know.

      MARGE wheels on him.

                                      MARGE
                      You think I knew there were boys
                      there!?  You try raising a
                      teenager alone.

      Then she and the girl are gone.  THOMPSON glares at PARKER.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                               (low to PARKER)
                      See they get home okay.

      PARKER shoves his hands in his pockets.  ON HIS FACE we

                                              FADE TO BLACK


39.   INT.  NANCY'S KITCHEN.  MORNING.                                   39.

                                              BURN ON

                              THE SECOND DAY

      FADE UP ON MARGE SIMSON opening a new bottle of gin, pouring
      herself a careful shot, drinking it, then chasing it with
      coffee.  Nearby a TV drones the morning news.  We can't yet see
      the SCREEN.

                                      TV NEWSCASTER (OS/FILTER)
                      In the headlines this morning --
                      a local teenage girl was brutally
                      murdered during an all-night party.

      MARGE TURNS, startled, seeing NANCY coming downstairs.

      The girl looks a little better than she did in the Police
      Station, but her eyes are still red-rimmed, and a vacant stress
      masks her face.  She looks to the TV.  Stops.

                                      TV NEWSCASTER (CONTD)
                      Police say the victim, fifteen-year
                      -old Christina Grey, had quarrelled
                      earlier with her boyfriend, Rod
                      Lane, a punk rocker with a history
                      of delinquency.  Lane is now the
                      subject of a city-wide manhunt.
                      According to --

39A.  The TV PICTURE has begun featuring a HANDHELD NEWSREEL SHOT of a
      dark rubber BODY BAG being carried to a CORONER'S VAN.  Just
      before the thing is lifted inside, TINA'S bloodied, white ARM
      slips from its zippered side and lolls into the dark night air.
      A man rudely shoves it back inside and pulls the zipper up the
      rest of the way.

39B.  WIDER -- as NANCY pales visible.  MARGE darts to the TV and slaps
      it off, then turning to NANCY.  She looks at the girl a moment,
      then goes to her and hugs her.

                                      MARGE
                              (kind)
                      Where you think you're going?

                                      NANCY
                      School.

                                      MARGE
                      I could hear you tossing and
                      turning all night, kiddo.  You've
                      no business going to school.

      NANCY pulls away, determined.

                                      NANCY
                      I gotta go to school, Mom.
                      Please.  Otherwise I'll just
                      sit up there and go crazy
                      or something.

      MARGE studies her face a moment.

                                      MARGE
                      Did you sleep?

                                      NANCY
                      I'll sleep in study hall, promise.
                      I'd rather keep busy, you know?

      She absently drains the woman's coffee cup -- then pecks her
      cheek.

                                      MARGE
                      Right home after.

                                      NANCY (cont'd)
                      Right home after.  See you.

      MARGE watches the girl disappear outside, then lights a cigarette
      from the one already burning in her fingers.


40.   EXT.  STREET.  DAY.                                                40.

      MUSIC slips back in, subtle but tense as we TRACK with NANCY as
      she walks alone down a sidewalk edged with thick flowering
      Oleander.  She cocks her head, puzzled, as if sensing something.
      MUSIC mounts.  NANCY looks across the street.

40A.  REVERSE IN HER POV.  A MAN is over there in dark clothes, reading  40A.
      a newspaper, but really watching her.

40B.  NANCY shrugs and continues on, then stops and looks back again.    40B.

40C.  IN HER POV we SEE the MAN is gone.                                 40C.

40D.  Next moment -- with a MUSIC STING -- a BLOODIED HAND jumps out     40D.
      from the opposite direction, clamps over NANCY'S mouth and drags
      her into the bushes.


41.   EXT.  BUSHES.  DAY.                                                41.

      NANCY struggles, twisting against the powerful assailant.

      A WIDER ANGLE REVEALS ROD LANE -- barefoot, clad only in jeans
      and leather jacket, still caked with dark blood.  The rest of his
      skin is pale as a ghost's.

                                      ROD
                      I'm not gonna hurt you.

      He releases her warily.  NANCY makes no move to run or scream,
      even though several STUDENTS pass on the nearby sidewalk.  This
      reassures ROD just a little.

                                      ROD
                      Your old man thinks I did it,
                      don't he?

                                      NANCY
                      He doesn't know you.
                              (eyeing the blood)
                      Couldn't you change?

                                      ROD
                      The cops were all over my house.
                              (shivers)
                      They'll kill me for sure.

                                      NANCY
                      Nobody's gonna kill you.

      He runs his hands down his face, trying to believe that.  The two
      study each other.

                                      ROD
                      I never touched her.

                                      NANCY
                      You were screaming like crazy.

      NANCY says this without accusation, just cool observation.

                                      ROD
                      Someone else was there.

                                      NANCY
                      The door was locked from your
                      side.

      ROD grabs her hard.  His muscular body tenses.

                                      ROD
                      Don't look at me like I'm some
                      kind of fucking fruitcake or
                      something, I'm warning you.

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                      Morning, Mr. Lane.

42.   The boy jerks around.  NANCY's father, his .38 leveled right at    42.
      ROD's belly, eases out of the bushes.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Now just step away from her, son.
                      Like your ass depended on it.
                      I'm warning you.

      ROD backs away, looking once at NANCY with a look of terrible
      sadness.  Then he dives out of the bushes and runs like hell.

      THOMPSON snaps his revolver to fire -- but instinctively NANCY
      jumps between --

                                      NANCY
                      No!

      THOMPSON jerks his gun into the air, furious.

                                      THOMPSON
                      Jesus -- are you crazy!?

      He plunges past the girl.


42A.  EXT.  STREET.  DAY.                                                42A.

      ROD races like a frightened animal across the lawns -- but is
      soon cut off by the PLANECLOTHESMAN NANCY saw watching her before
      -- and then TWO UNIFORMED POLICEMAN, who close from another
      angle.  The chase is short and pitifully off-balance, and ROD is
      soon wrestled to the ground.  Next moment one of the cops is
      holding ROD'S knife into the air for THOMPSON to see.  THOMPSON
      looks at NANCY, as if to say 'I told you.' Background, ROD'S
      SHOUTS can be heard as he's shoved into a SQUAD CAR.

                                      ROD (O.S.)
                      I didn't do it -- !
                              (fading)
                      I didn't kill her, Nancy!

      The car's door slams and ROD is gone.  NANCY turns to her father,
      livid.

                                      NANCY
                      You used me, daddy!

                                      LT THOMPSON
                              (exasperated)
                      What the hell you doing going to
                      school today, anyway -- your
                      mother told me you didn't even
                      sleep last night!

      NANCY spins angrily and walks away.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Nancy!  Hey!

      But she just keeps going.

                                              FADE TO BLACK


43.   INT.  CLASSROOM.  DAY.                                             43.

      FADE UP ON an ENGLISH TEACHER and CLASS, NANCY among the kids,
      trying to concentrate.

                                      TEACHER
                      According to Shakespeare, there
                      was something operating in Nature,
                      perhaps inside human nature itself,
                      that was rotten -- a canker, as
                      he put it.

      The TEACHER'S eyes glance across the room.  ANGLE ON NANCY;
      yawning but listening.

                                      TEACHER (CONTD)
                      Of course Hamlet's response to
                      this, and to his mother's lies,
                      was to continually probe and
                      dig -- just like the gravediggers --
                      always trying to get beneath the
                      surface.  The same was true in a
                      different way in Julius Caesar.
                      Jon, go ahead...

      She nods to a SURFER who's been waiting uncomfortably in front of
      the class.  He squints at his book and begins, the recitation a
      struggle between baked and salted brain and the poetry of the
      Bard.

                                      SURFER
                              (reading aloud)
                      Uh, In the most high and palmy
                      state of Rome...

                                      WISEGUY STUDENT (O.S.)
                      California's the most high and
                      palmy state, man.

      The SURFER halts with a grin; KIDS snicker.

                                      ENGLISH TEACHER
                      Can it.

      She glares them back into silence.  The SURFER starts over, as we
      CUT TO NANCY.

      She's nodding off now, barely able to keep her eyes open in the
      warm, close boredom of the classroom.

                                      SURFER (O.S.)
                      In the most high and palmy state
                      of Rome, a little ere the mightiest
                      Julius fell...
                              (NANCY's head pitches
                               forward; she jerks it
                               back up, barely awake)
                      The graves stood tenantless, and
                      the sheeted dead did squeak and
                      gibber in the Roman street...

44.   NANCY's head has sunk again, eyelids drawn as if by enormous       44.
      weight.  By the time her cheek's against the desk, the SURFER'S
      VOICE is ECHOED and DISTANT.  But another voice, TINA'S, is very
      near, very much present.  A sad, thin plaint.

                                      TINA (O.S.)
                      Nancy.

      NANCY gives a start.  Her eyes lock onto something.

45.   REVERSE.  TILTED SIDEWAYS, IN HER HEAD'S POV, we look straight     45.
      out through the open doorway of the classroom into the hall.
      There, standing in a black pool of fluid, is a full-sized rubber
      body bag.  Dark red and yellow.  Weaving slightly, the merest
      suggesting of movement within it.

46.   BACK ON NANCY, sitting upright, wiping the sleep from her eyes,    46.
      shaking her head like a punchy prozefighter.  She looks back out
      the door.

47.   REVERSE IN 'NORMAL' POV -- the hallway is empty.  But there's a    47.
      dark smear on its floor tiles.

48.   NANCY looks nervously towards the rest of the class.  No one else  48.
      has noticed a thing outside the door.  All are dumbly spellbound
      by the SURFER, who now recites like a deep-voiced robot, his face
      wreathed by white hair.

                                      SURFER
                      O God, I could be bounded in a
                      nutshell and count myself a king
                      of infinite space, were it not
                      that I have bad dreams...

49.   ANGLE BACK ON NANCY.  She slips from her seat, eye warily on the   49.
      teacher and class.  But no one turns as she disappears through
      the doorway.


50.   INT.  SCHOOL HALLWAY.  DAY.                                        50.

      NANCY turns and looks both directions.  No sign of anybody.

                                      TINA (O.S.)
                              (distant)
                      Nancy.

      NANCY wheels and sees the bag, prone on the tiles at the far end
      of the hall, at the end of a long snail's trail of slime.  A pale
      hand thrusts out of it.  A moment later, as if pulled by
      invisible gravity, the bag slides out of sight into an
      intersecting corridor.

                                      NANCY
                      Tina!

      NANCY starts running for it.

51.   ANGLE AT THE CORNER as NANCY races blindly around the turn and     51.
      smashes straight into a BODY lunging at her from the opposite
      direction!  Both go down.

52.   ANGLE AT THE FLOOR.  A dazed freshman HALLGUARD cranks herself up  52.
      on one elbow.  She wears a plastic plaque on her red and yellow
      sweater that reads 'Hall Guard'.  Her nose is bleeding from the
      impact.

                                      HALLGUARD
                      Y-you're not supposed to run.
                      W-where's your pass -- you got a
                      pass?

      NANCY leaps up --

                                      NANCY
                      Screw your stupid pass!

53.   She turns -- sees the body bag halfway down this darker, narrower  53.
      hall, upright again.  But just as she sees it, it tips and
      pitches headlong through a doorway -- like some godawful rotten
      tree finally timbering down.  She can hear the sickening
      CRUNCHING of it falling down a long flight of stairs.

      NANCY runs for it again.  The HALLGUARD staggers up FOREGROUND,
      bleeding profusely from her eyes and ears.

                                      HALLGUARD
                      Hey, no running in the halls!

      The HALLGUARD raises her hand and we see it's tipped with long
      metal spikes.

      REVERSE ANGLE AT THE DOOR as NANCY runs up.  NANCY turns to check
      out the HALLGUARD.  She's vanished.  NANCY turns and looks down
      through the open door.  The MUSIC sweeps through a strange,
      brooding movement of strings, mounting towards the NIGHTMARE
      THEME.


54.   INT.  A STAIRWELL.                                                 54.

      NANCY edges into the stairwell and looks down.  Looks like
      there's a fire somewhere down there, from the way the orange
      light dances.  But there's only a low WHITE NOISE.

                                      NANCY
                      Tina?

      No answer.  NANCY starts down the stairs.


55.   INT.  BOILER ROOM.  DAY.                                           55.

      NANCY comes off the stairs into a dank boiler room.  The smear
      trail is there.  It runs behind a cracking, red-hot boiler the
      size of a diesel locomotive.  Everything about the place feels
      dreadfully wrong, and the MUSIC is deep into the NIGHTMARE THEME
      when it pauses.

      TIGHT ON NANCY.  Slow terror moves into her face.  There's a low,
      sinister GIGGLE.

56.   REVERSE IN HER POV -- we see a tangle of pipes, shadows, and the   56.
      tainted fire of the huge boiler.  Then from behind this, deeply
      shadowed but still identifiable, steps TINA's KILLER.  The same
      filthy red and yellow sweater and slouch hat, the same melted
      face twisting into a smile, the same GARBLED LAUGH as he slides
      the long blades from beneath his shirt and fans them on the ends
      of his bony fingers.

                                      NANCY
                      Who are you?

                                      MAN
                      Gonna get you.

57.   The leering MAN brings the bloodied scalpel-fingernails across     57.
      his own chest, splitting a nipple.  Yellow fluid pours out.
      MAGGOTS and WORMS.

      NANCY forgets the question -- jerks around and flees in blind
      panic into the first opening she sees -- a dark pipe tunnel.


58.   INT.  PIPE TUNNEL.                                                 58.

      ANGLE IN THE NARROW PASSAGEWAY.  In the BACKGROUND the killer
      shambles towards her; FOREGROUND NANCY breaks into a run.

      The killer sprints -- NANCY tears ahead into darkness.

      She flees deeper and deeper into the labyrinth of steaming,
      SIZZLING pipes, squeezing through smaller and smaller openings.
      The killer is just yards behind her, and soon she's trapped, just
      as TINA was before her.

      She presses her back to the wet bricks.  There's no hope of
      fighting him off, for NANCY is not as strong as TINA.  But she is
      smart as hell, and thinking even in this nightmare.  So by the
      time the creep has raised his knives to strike, NANCY has
      realized something.  She wheels and shoves her arm against one of
      the scalding steam pipes.  In the sme split second we HEAR her
      flesh scald, we

                                                      CUT TO:


59.   INT.  ENGLISH CLASS.  DAY.                                         59.

      NANCY lurches up SCREAMING, arm raised to ward off the invisible
      blow, books clattering to the floor -- other GIRLS nearby SCREAM
      in surprise as she stumbles over them.  Then she stops, confused
      and groggy from the nightmare.

      WIDER ANGLE.  EVERYBODY is staring at NANCY as if she's gone
      mad.  The ENGLISH TEACHER rushes over, herself frightened by the
      terror in the girl's eyes.

                                      TEACHER
                      Okay -- Okay, Thompson!  Every-
                      thing's all right now -- Nancy!.

60.   NANCY jerks around with panicked eyes, expecting the killer to     60.
      leap from any direction.  But there's only the sea of staring
      eyes.

      NANCY begins methodically picking up her books.

                                      TEACHER
                      I'll call your mother.

                                      NANCY
                      No!  No, really, I'm fine.  I'll go
                      straight home.  I'm okay.

      She marches for the door.

                                      TEACHER
                      You'll need a hall pass!

      But the girl's gone.


61.   EXT.  THE SCHOOL.  DAY.                                            61.

      NANCY walks out of the building, shaken.  Then she pauses at one
      of the big pine trees out front, stops and rests her head against
      its bark, teeth set.  NANCY starts to shake, and next second
      she's sobbing like a broken-hearted, frightened child.        OMIT 61A.
OMIT 61A.
62.   But she shakes herself silent.  Wipes the tears away with a slash  62.
      of sleeve.  She rubs her arm absently, lost in thought, then
      reacts in surprise and pain.  She lifts her arm and stares at the
      spot she's touched.

      INSERT ON HER ARM and the BURN there; about the size and shape of
      a half-dollar.

      WIDER ON NANCY.  Utterly, chillingly confused.

62A.  TINA, against the tree inches from NANCY, (SC 7) -- turns to her and
      says --

                                      TINA
                      Couldn't get back to sleep
                      at all.
                              (beat)
                      What you dream?


63.   EXT.  A BUSY STREET.  DAY.                                         63.

      NANCY is walking quickly, head erect, jaw set.  Then she enters
      her father's Police Station.


64.   INT.  VAN NUYS POLICE STATION.  DAY.                               64.

      NANCY crosses directly to the GARCIA.

                                      NANCY
                      My dad here?

      GARCIA looks up from his paperwork.

                                      SERGEANT GARCIA
                      Lieutenant.

      LT THOMPSON emerges from another room, uneasy to see NANCY.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Decide to take a day off after
                      all?

                                      NANCY
                      Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.

      THOMPSON doesn't miss a beat.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Only family allowed, Nancy.  You
                      know the drill.

                                      NANCY
                      Just want to talk to him a second.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      He's dangerous.

                                      NANCY
                      You don't know he did it.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      No, I know, thanks to your
                      own testimony, that he was
                      locked in a room with a girl
                      who went in alive and came
                      out in a rubber bag.

      NANCY flinches; her father shows the first signs of color in his
      neck.

                                      NANCY
                      I just want to talk to him.
                              (beat, lower)
                      Please, Dad.

      THOMPSON shifts almost imperceptibly towards GARCIA, then turns
      back to NANCY.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Make it fast.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


65.   INT.  CELL AREA.  DAY.                                             65.

      A GUARD exits pushing a cart of food trays.  NANCY waits warily
      until he's gone, then looks back to ROD LANE.  ROD looks more
      like a captured coyote than a human; haggard, ribbed, expecting
      poisoned bait.  His hair is wet, his clothes are borrowed jeans
      and work shirt.

                                      NANCY
                              (low)
                      And then what happened?

                                      ROD
                      I told you.
                              (reluctantly)
                      It was dark, but I'm sure there
                      was someone else IN there, under
                      the covers with her.

      NANCY reacts.

                                      NANCY
                      How could somebody get under
                      the covers with you guys
                      without you knowing it?

                                      ROD
                      How the fuck do I know?
                              (beat)
                      I don't expect you to believe
                      me.

      NANCY studies his encrypted eyes.  Surprisingly, she looks like
      she just might believe him.  She leans closer with a new
      thought.

                                      NANCY
                      What he look like?  You get
                      a look at him?

      He looks away.

                                      ROD
                      No.

                                      NANCY
                      Well then how can you say
                      somebody else was there?

                                      ROD
                      Because somebody cut her.  While
                      I watched.

      Now the place is so quiet you can hear heartbeats.

                                      NANCY
                      Somebody cut her while you watched
                      and you don't know what he looked
                      like?

      ROD smiles an insane smile, stuck with a reality no one will
      buy.

                                      ROD
                      You couldn't see the fucker.
                      You could just see the cuts
                      happening, all at once.

      NANCY gives a twitch.

                                      NANCY
                      What you mean 'all at once'?

                                      ROD
                              (low)
                      I mean, it was as if there were
                      four razors cutting her at the
                      same time.  But invisible razors.
                      She just... opened up...

      By now he's picking at a clot of dark blood on his jacket, as if
      it was a scab on his own body.  Then he catches NANCY watching
      and turns away to the back of the cell.  He smashes his fist into
      the wall -- bone-crushing blows that scare the wits out of
      NANCY.

                                      NANCY
                      Rod!

      He stops, and his fist is dripping blood as he says in a small,
      sad voice.

                                      ROD
                      I probably could've saved her
                      if I'd moved sooner...  But I
                      thought it was just another
                      nightmare, like the one I had
                      the night before.
                              (beat)
                      There... was this guy who had
                      knives for fingers...

      CLOSE ON NANCY, unable to swallow the gorge rising in her
      throat.  ROD turns to her, and to his surprise she's ashen.

                                      ROD (CONTD)
                      Do you think I did it?

                                      NANCY
                      No.

                                                FADE TO BLACK


66.   EXT.  ELM STREET / NANCY'S HOME.  NIGHT.                           66.

      FADE UP ON ESTABLISHING SHOT as a spooky WIND sets a DOG BARKING
      down the block.  A CAR goes by, then this pleasant residential
      street falls into silence.  CAMERA has MOVED IN on NANCY's
      well-tended two-story home.


67.   INT.  NANCY'S KITCHEN.  NIGHT.                                     67.

      The house is in shadow.  Alone, MARGE scrapes the last of the
      evening's dishes and slips them into the dishwasher.  Neither she
      nor her daughter has touched the food.  But MARGE is well into a
      bottle of gin; her appetite for that is growing, right along with
      her dread.  She turns and looks up the stairs, calling.

                                      MARGE
                      Nancy, don't fall asleep in
                      there.

                                      NANCY (OS)
                      I won't.

                                      MARGE
                      Get into bed.


68.   INT.  UPSTAIRS BATHROOM.  NIGHT.                                   68.

                                      NANCY
                      I will.

      NANCY'S in the tub, so drowsy she can hardly rinse without
      falling asleep.  The water in the tub is opaque with suds.
      Luxurious.

      CLOSER ANGLE, AT WATER LEVEL ON NANCY.  Her eyes droop.  She
      slides closer to the surface of the water, letting its heat sooth
      her nerves.  Her eyes stare straight up, glazed; her breathing
      deepens.

      REVERSE, across to her legs, crooked, one knee on each side of
      the tub.  There's a ripple in the water between.  Then something
      tiny and shiny breaks the surface between them.  It pops up with
      a slithering MUSIC CUE and catches a sliver of light.  Then it
      begins to rise.

      Higher and higher it rises, soon accompanied by another, then two
      more shining, gleaming blades, and then the full glove and dark
      hairy hand and then the wrist and arm, straight up light an evil
      sapling between the girl's knees, the knives bloosoming into a
      bright flower of razor sharp steel in the air, moving over the
      girl's belly.  The hand rears back, the claws arch to strike.

                                      MARGE (OS/APPROACHING)
                      Nancy?

      MARGE raps on the door.  The instant she does NANCY jerks up,
      opening her eyes groggily.  The dark wet arm, hand and knifes are
      gone.

                                      NANCY
                      What?

                                      MARGE (OS)
                              (through the door)
                      You're not falling asleep,
                      are you?  You could drown,
                      you know.

                                      NANCY
                      Mother, for petesakes.

                                      MARGE (OS)
                      It happens all the time.
                              (brighter)
                      I've got some warm milk all
                      ready for you.  Why don't you
                      jump into bed?
                              (fading)
                      I'm gonna turn on your electric
                      blanket, too.  C'mon, now.
                              (then she's gone into
                               another room)

                                      NANCY
                              (low)
                      Warm milk.  Gross.

      She slides down to water level again, and sings softly,
      thoughtfully to herself.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      One, two, Freddie's coming for
                      you, three four, better lock
                      your door, five six, grab your
                      crucifix, seven eight gonna
                      stay up late, nine ten, never
                      sleep again...

      The next instant she's jerked with incredible violence straight
      down beneath the surface of the tub -- as if the bottom had
      suddenly dropped out and she was in a bottomless well!


68A.  EXT.  UNDERWATER SHOT.  NIGHT.                                     68A.

      LOOKING UP PAST HER ANKLES we SEE NANCY pulled sharply down into
      really deep water, the dim light of the surface and bathroom
      beyond receding with each yank.  And yet she somehow flails and
      gasps and struggles back towards the surface, managing by pure
      panic to break the surface with her hands!


68B.  INT.  HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHROOM.                                    68B.

      MARGE rushes to the door and listens, alarmed at the wild
      SPLASHING audible through the locked door.

                                      MARGE
                      Nancy!  NANCY!


68C.  EXT.  UNDERWATER SHOT.  NIGHT.                                     68C.

      MARGE'S VOICE reaches to the girl, who thrusts up through main
      force and breaks the surface with her head and shoulders.


68D.  INT.  BATHTUB.                                                     68D.

      Gasping and choking, NANCY breaks the surface of her bathwater,
      like a drowning sailer getting one last chance.  Her mother's
      VOICE booms over her, ECHOED and frantic -- and the loud BANGING
      on the door finally opens her eyes.  She turns and calls gasping
      to her mother --

                                      NANCY
                      Mommy!

      REVERSE ON THE DOOR -- as MARGE, using the old hangar through the
      doorhandle truck, makes it into the room.  She rushes across to
      the tub.  NANCY is staggering up in the bathwater, again with
      solid porcelain beneath her feet.

                                      MARGE
                      I told you!  Hundreds of people
                      a year drown like that!

      The mother throws a towel around the gasping girl, helps her from
      the tub and begins drying her like a child.  NANCY looks like
      she's likes paralized with some sort of weird dread.

                                      MARGE
                      You okay?

                                      NANCY
                      Great

                                      MARGE
                              (not believing it for
                               a minute)
                      To bed with you, c'mon.

      MARGE rushes out to get the room ready.  NANCY turns and looks at
      herself in the cabinet mirror, then opens the medicine chest and
      begins a quick, furtive search.

      CLOSER as she takes out the box of No Doz and slips it into her
      robe.

71.   INT.  HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                                             71.

      NANCY emerges from the bathroom yawning.  MARGE follows as the
      girl plods obediently to her room.

                                      MARGE
                      No television, forget the
                      homework, no phone calls.

                                      NANCY
                      No, Mother.  Yes, Mother.
                      No, Mother.


72.   INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        72.

                                      MARGE
                      And no school tomorrow, either.
                      you take a little vacation, relax
                      and rest for a change.

                                      NANCY
                      Yes, Mother.  G'night.

      MARGE offers a smile, and a little yellow pill.

                                      MARGE
                      Take this, it'll help you sleep.

                                      NANCY
                      Right.

      NANCY pops it in her mouth and swallows obediently.  MARGE leans
      to her with a kiss.

                                      MARGE
                      Sleep tight, don't let the
                      bedbugs bite.

      MARGE goes out, relieved.  NANCY closes the door, leans against
      it and spits the pill into her hand.  She tosses it straight out
      her window and takes a NoDoz.

                                              FADE TO BLACK

74.   FADE UP ON INSERT OF TELEVISION SCREEN.                            74.

      A MONSTER MOVIE in BLACK AND WHITE.  NO SOUND from the set.

75.   PULL BACK to REVEAL NANCY propped up in bed, furtively watching.  Or  75.
      is she just thinking?  A bedside CLOCK reads 12:45 pm.

      The girl YAWNS.  She shakes herself violently and sits up
      straighter, forcing herself to concentrate on the movie.

75A.  ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN.  A DIVER struggles to keep facing a      75A.
      large circling shark.

75B.  ON NANCY.  Her eyes droop shut -- then she jerks awake, rattling   75B.
      her head as if it were a radio drifting off station.  She tumbles
      out of bed, throws open the window and takes a deep breath of the
      cool night air.


76.   EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE AND STREET.  NIGHT.                            76.

      HIGH ANGLE, AT SECOND-STORY LEVEL.  NANCY looks directly across
      the street to a lighted, open window.  Its curtains, sucked out
      and waving in the night breeze, give the only motion to the
      deserted street.

      Then someone pitches out of the dark at her.  NANCY gives a YELP
      -- then clamps her hand over her mouth as she recognizes GLEN,
      balanced precariously on the rose trellis outside her window.

                                      GLEN
                      Sorry!  Saw your light on.
                      Thought I'd see how you were.

      She gets herself together, barely.

                                      NANCY
                      Sometimes I wish you didn't live
                      right across the street.

                                      GLEN
                      Shut up and let me in.  You ever
                      stand on a rose trellis in your
                      bare feet?


76A.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        76A.

      NANCY looks over her shoulder to make sure her mother hasn't
      heard.  GLEN's already through her window and planted on her
      bed.  NANCY points to a chair.

                                      NANCY
                      If you don't mind.

      GLEN crosses to the chair and plops down.

                                      GLEN
                      So.  I heard you freaked out
                      in English class today.

      There's no maliciousness in his voice, and the familiar frankness
      is actually comforting to NANCY.

                                      NANCY
                      Guess I did.

                                      GLEN
                      Haven't slept, have you?

                                      NANCY
                      Not really.

      NANCY tries to smile, but can't fake it very well.  GLEN looks
      her over.

                                      GLEN
                      You look dead and rained on, if
                      you want the ugly truth.  And
                      what you do to your arm?

      She shrugs, trying to keep it casual.

                                      NANCY
                      Burned myself in Englsh class.

      She hazards a look in the mirror, and her jaw drops.

                                      NANCY
                      M'god, I look twenty years old.
                              (turning back to him)
                      You have any weird dreams last
                      night?

                                      GLEN
                      Slept like a rock.

                                      NANCY
                              (pleased)
                      Well at least I have an objective
                      wall to bounce this off.
                              (off)
                      You believe it's possible to dream
                      about what's going to happen?

                                      GLEN
                      No.

                                      NANCY
                      You believe in the Boogey Man?

                                      GLEN
                      One two, Freddie's coming
                      for you?  No.  Rod killed Tina.
                      he's a fruitcake and you know it.

                                      NANCY
                      You believe in anything?

                                      GLEN
                      I believe in you, me, and
                      Rock and Roll.  And I'm not
                      too sure about you lately.

      NANCY thinks.

                                      NANCY
                      Listen, I got a crazy favor
                      to ask.

                                      GLEN
                      Uh-oh...

                                      NANCY
                      It's nothing too hard or anything.
                              (beat)
                      I'm just going to... LOOK
                      for someone, and... I want
                      you to be sort of a ...guard.
                      Okay?

      GLEN makes the Twilight Zone sound.

                                      NANCY
                      Okay?

                                      GLEN
                      Okay, okay.
                              (beat)
                      I think.

      She comes very close to him.

                                      NANCY
                      You won't screw up, right?  I
                      mean, a whole lot might depend
                      on it.

      The way she's looking at him gives him the creeps.

                                      GLEN
                      Okay, I won't screw up.

77.   Nancy takes a deep breath.  Then without another word turns off    77.
      the TV and the light.

                                      GLEN (IN DARK)
                      Jesus, it's dark in here.

                                      NANCY
                      Shhh.  Now listen, here's what
                      we're gonna do...


78.   EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          78.

      FADE UP ON NANCY, still in her pajamas, walking through the
      shadowy streets near her home, listening for the slightest
      sound.  We MOVE with her.  But nothing, not even the dog barking
      earlier, is there now.  NANCY peers into the darkness of lawns
      and trees behind her.

                                      NANCY
                              (stage whisper)
                      You still there?

      Across the street and a distance away, GLEN steps from behind a
      tree.

                                      GLEN
                      Yeah.  So?

                                      NANCY
                      Just checking -- keep out of
                      sight!

      GLEN throws up his hands in exasperation and walks back out of
      sight.  NANCY turns and looks down between the houses, deep into
      a dark alleyway.  Then she forces herself to walk into it.


79.   EXT.  ALLEY.  NIGHT.                                               79.

      MOVING WITH HER as she makes herself go deeper and deeper into
      shadows.  Each time she pauses and waits, the MUSIC grows more
      threatening and expectant.  The feeling is of immense tension --
      we're sure the killer will come screaming out on her at any
      second.

      But he doesn't.  In fact absolutely nothing happens, and NANCY
      emerges from the far end of the alley unscathed.  The only thing
      strange is that she now finds her self looking across the mall to


80.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      80.

      The Police Station.  It takes her a little by surprise, it just
      seems to have appeared.

      MUSIC creeps into the NIGHTMARE THEME as NANCY whispers hoarsely
      back down the dark alley.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Still there?


81.   EXT.  ALLEY.  NIGHT.                                               81.

      We only HEAR the DISTANT VOICE, slightly ECHOED.

                                      GLEN'S VOICE (OS)
                              (yawning)
                      Still here!

                                      NANCY
                      On your toes, right?

      NANCY stares into the dark trying to see him, but she can't.  She
      turns back and makes up her mind to move without him in sight.


82.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      82.

      MUSIC MOUNTS as we MOVE WITH NANCY across the lawns to the police
      station, creeping to the first lighted window she sees.  It's a
      low, barred basement window, and NANCY reacts as soon as she
      looks through it.


83.   INT.  ROD'S CELL.  NIGHT.                                          83.

      NANCY'S POV down into ROD LANE's cell.  The boy is on his rough
      cot, twitching in disturbed sleep.  And a long SHADOW is sliding
      across the wall.

      A big SHAPE appears in the shadowed corridor outside the boy's
      cell, and as IT walks closer NANCY can barely see it's the
      shambling, grimly scarred man with the filthy red and yellow
      sweater and strange slouch hat pulled across his brow.  The
      KILLER from all of their nightmares.

      And this giant shadow of a man passes through the bars of the
      cell, like so much evil Jello.  Halfway through he pauses,
      turning to check over his shoulder.  We see the bars clearly
      penetrating his body, going in his head, passing out his ankles.
      Then he turns back to ROD and moves forward, and within another
      heartbeat is beside the boy.


84.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      84.

      NANCY draws back sharply, swallowing in terror.  She looks behind
      her for help.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Glen.

      No answer.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                              (louder)
                      Glen?!

      The street is absolutely deserted.  There is no motion, and no
      sound save one: the distant but unmistakeable sound of GLEN
      SNORING.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      GLEN!

      A beat of silence after the shout's echoes die, then the steady,
      boyish SNORES again.  NANCY swears under her breath and jerks
      back around, forcing herself to look again into ROD's cell.


85.   INT.  ROD'S CELL.                                                  85.

      IN HER POV -- the killer picks up ROD's bedsheet and tests it
      between his powerful hands.  Without thinking, NANCY bangs
      against the glass.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Rod!  Look out!

      The KILLER wheels around, locking eyes with NANCY.  The girl goes
      white.  The man's face is in the light, and it's horrible --
      seething with hatred and a twisted, insane intelligence.

      The hold of those eyes is only broken when ROD rolls up on an
      elbow with a deep, troubled GROAN.  The instant ROD does this,
      the KILLER fades into the shadows in the cell.  But even then his
      eyes hold on NANCY's until the last second he's visible.

      ROD looks around the cell groggily, runs his fingers through his
      matted hair, then collapses back on his pillow.  No matter how
      hard NANCY screams, ROD never once looks at the window.  He just
      pulls the twisted covers about his shoulders and succumbs once
      more to sleep.

	And now the bed sheet is no longer on the bed.  The KILLER,
      materializing out of the shadow again, is holding it between his
      hands like a garrote.  He looks up and leers at NANCY, then moves
      for ROD.


86.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      86.

	ANGLE BACK ON NANCY.  She pounds on the window, then turns in
      frustration and yells into the night.

                                      NANCY
                      Glen!!

      She turns back to the cell in desperation.


87.   OMIT                                                          OMIT 87.


88.   INT.  ROD'S CELL.                                                  88.

	IN NANCY'S POV we look into a cell that is quite deserted save
      for ROD.  Sleeping peacefully.


89.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      89.

	NANCY pulls back from the window, stunned.

                                      NANCY
                      I swear...

      Suddenly NANCY feels utterly exposed.  She shivers, chilled and
      vulnerable to the bone in her thin night clothes.  She can't
      move.  It's as if some great nerve between her instincts and body
      had been severed.  And she hears the SOUND behind her.  A sort of
      filling-vibrating Scrriiitchh.

      MUSIC sneaks in -- the unmistakeable NIGHTMARE THEME, creeping
      over her.  NANCY forces herself, by sheer will, to look.

90.   Ahead of her perhaps twenty-five feet, covered with a thick        90.
      plastic body bag through which we can barely see her face, is
      TINA.  Standing square in the middle of the street.  A dark ooze
      of BLACK EELS roil out of its bottom, and at its top, the zipper
      CHATTERS down and the greenish-white face of TINA lolls out.  She
      gestures, supplicating, her watery eyes desperate to convey some
      desperate message.

      The MUSIC FALLS TO A HUSH.

91.   NANCY backs away, eyes streaming tears.                            91.

                                      NANCY
                      Glen, where are you!  Wake up!
                      Glen!

                                      DEEP RAGGED VOICE
                      I'm here.

      NANCY twists around in horror at the same instant the KILLER
      grabs for her face with his knife-fingers!  The girl
      intinctively pitches back, then scrambles up and runs like
      hell!

                                      NANCY
                      Glen!  Glen!!!


92.   EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          92.

      MOVING WITH NANCY at full gallop, running blind.  She crashes
      through a sawhorse into a new sidewalk, sinking into the wet
      cement over her ankles.  The stuff sticks to her legs in long
      gluey globs and she can barely pull her feet loose.

      The KILLER looms nearby,
      mocking her -- his scalpel claws gleaming in the streetlight.  He
      just misses the girl as she wrenches free and flees again, now so
      winded she can only stagger.

      MOVING WITH THEM.  Time after time NANCY just barely manages to
      elude the shadowy form, leaping from his reach by inches and
      pouring on more steam.  It's too close to even bother screaming
      now; and besides, that would take breath she doesn't have.  The
      only SOUND is of RUNNING FOOTSTEPS, RASPING BREATH and the
      KNIFE-FINGERS WHISTLING through the air.


93.   EXT.  NANCY'S HOME.  NIGHT.                                        93.

      NANCY tears across her front lawn and into the open front door of
      her home, SLAMMING it with all her might.  There's a tremendously
      satisfying CONCUSSION of wood against doorframe, and the LOCKS
      fall shut.


94.   INT.  NANCY'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                 94.

                                      NANCY
                      Glennn!!!

      But her voice is garbled as if she's under water, and there's no
      answer.  The only clue to Glen being there at all is his distant
      SNORING.  Innocent.  Persistent.  Deep.

      NANCY stops, breath in shreds, face smeared with dirt and tears.
      Something is clawing the window in the dark of the kitchen.
      NANCY looks and catches the MAN prying at the glass with his big
      knife-fingers, the sharp blades SIZZLING against the edges of the
      glass as they crack it away from the frame.  NANCY runs upstairs
      in blind panic.


95.   INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        95.

      NANCY darts into her unlit bedroom, slams the door and locks it.

      Safe at last.

      She listens at the door.  Nothing.  She crosses to her bed.  Next
      second the KILLER dives through her window and seizes her in a
      shower of shattered glass!

      NANCY twists and manages to grab the wrist of his knife hand with
      both of hers, barely keeping the blades from her throat.

      The two fall backwards in a terrible, gasping struggle, crashing
      onto NANCY's bed.  Her grip is broken -- the MAN stabs -- NANCY
      twists away, backed into a corner of bed and walls.  Defenseless,
      she snatches a pillow up; the KILLER lashes out -- disemboweling
      the pilow and sending a great gush of feathers flying.  NANCY
      dives for escape in a virtual blizzard.

      The KILLER manages to snare her with his other hand, and the two
      crash across the bedside table to the floor, the table and all
      its contents cascading around them in a whiteout of feathers.

      ANGLE AT FLOOR LEVEL -- CLOSE ON NANCY'S AND THE KILLER'S HEADS.
      The blades inch towards the girl's face -- the drool of the
      grizzled shadow with the horribly scarrred face spills into her
      eyes.  Feathers are everywhere; MUSIC is absolutely insane!

      But just when the points of steel are less than an inch from her
      eyes, the old fashioned alarm clock thrown to the floor next to
      NANCY's head goes off with a jarring RINGGGGGGG!

96.   Instantly the MUSIC STOPS.  And a moment later the room is         96.
      light.

      WIDER as NANCY reels up, blinded by the sudden light, SCREAMING
      AND FIGHTING on her bed.

      ANGLE ON GLEN, lurching from his own sleep at the frightening
      noise.  He discovers NANCY pressed in terror against her
      headboard, clutching a pillow like a drowning woman would a
      straw.

      It's an intact pillow, and there isn't a feather in sight.

      NANCY stares incredulously at GLEN, then around the room,
      untangling herself from her bedclothes.  Wary and furious, her
      voice hoarse.

                                      NANCY
                      Glen, you bastard...

      The boy looks at his friend in groggy alarm.  She's absolutely
      livid, more angry than he's ever seen her, and more strange.

                                      GLEN	
                      What I do?

      He reaches for her -- she flattens against the wall, eyes hard,
      and terribly hurt, too.

                                      NANCY
                              (low)
                      I asked you to do just one thing.
                      Just stay awake and watch me --
                      Just wake me if it looked like
                      I was having a bad dream.
                              (eyes wild)
                      But you.  You shit -- what do
                      you do -- you fall asleep!

      She stops herself, wiping a bit of spittle off her lip, alarmed
      at how out of control she's become.  And suddenly she breaks,
      sinking into her 	torn bedclothes and rubbing her head.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                              (mostly to herself)
                      I must be going nuts...

                                      MARGE (OS)
                      Nancy?

      Her mother's door opens OS.

                                      GLEN
                      Oh, shit.

      NANCY composes her voice as best she can.

                                      NANCY
                      Yes, mother?

      MARGE's flip-flops approach outside the door.  GLEN barrels out
      the window -- NANCY dives for the bed, jams off the light and
      disappears under the covers.  MARGE, bleary eyed herself, opens
      the door and flicks on the light.

                                      MARGE
                              (beat)
                      You okay?

                                      NANCY
                              (weakly)
                      Yeah.  Just had a little dream.
                      I'm falling right back to sleep.

                                      MARGE
                              (beat)
                      Okay... You need anything, just call.

                                      NANCY
                      Okay.

      MARGE closes the door.  NANCY immediately sits up and looks at
      the window.  A single bone-white feather floats down in the
      moonlight.  Then it's sucked outside and is gone.


97.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      97.

      GLEN's CADILLAC CONVERTABLE careens into the parking lot and
      SCREECHES to a stop.  GLEN and NANCY jump out and head for the
      station.

                                      GLEN
                      You mind telling me what's 
                      going on?

      NANCY's races into the station without answering.

                                      GLEN (CONTD)
                      Oh, I see.  That makes it all 
                      perfectly clear.


98.   INT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      98.

      NANCY goes straight to the SERGEANT's desk.

                                      NANCY
                      Garcia, I want to see Rod
                      Lane again.

      GARCIA winces.

                                      SGT GARCIA
                      I thought when I took the
                      night shift I'd have peace
                      and quiet for a change.

                                      NANCY
                      It's urgent, we've gotta see Rod.

                                      SGT GARCIA
                      It's three in the morning.
                      Your mother know you're out this 
                      late?

                                      NANCY
                              (faking it)
                      Of course -- look, at least go
                      back and look at him.  Just see
                      if he's okay.

      GARCIA glances at GLEN.

                                      GLEN
                              (faking it)
                      We have reason to think there
                      might be something weird going 
                      on.

                                      LT THOMPSON (OS)
                      Oh, no argument on that.

      NANCY jumps around at the sound of her father's voice.  LT
      THOMPSON emerges from his office, rumpled and yawning.

                                      NANCY
                      Dad -- what you doing here?

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      It so happens I work here, and
                      there's an unsolved murder.  I
                      don't like unsolved murders, 
                      especially ones my daughter's
                      mixed up in -- what are you
                      doing here at this hour?  You're
                      supposed to be getting some 
                      sleep.

                                      GLEN
                      Listen, sir, this is serious.
                      Nancy had a nightmare about Rod
                      being in danger, or something,
                      and so she thinks...

      He trails off, loosing it under LT THOMPSON's glare.  Besides, he
      doesn't know exactly what the hell's really going on himself.
      GARCIA puts his beefy hand on NANCY's shoulder.

                                      NANCY
                      I just want to see if he's okay!

                                      SGT GARCIA
                      Take my word for it, Nancy.  The
                      guy's sleeping like a baby.  He's
                      not going anywhere.


99.   INT.  CELL BLOCK.  NIGHT.                                          99.

      ANGLE ON ROD in his cell.  He's asleep, all right, but not safely
      so.  His bedsheet has come alive.  It twitches, pulsates, then
      snakes towards his throat.

      ROD stirs, the sheet falls still; ROD slips into deeper sleep,
      and the sheet moves again, completing the noose around his neck!


100.  INT.  BOOKING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        100.

      NANCY makes a move for the cell block --

                                      NANCY
                      This isn't your average nightmare,
                      Daddy -- damn it!

      The door's locked; she hauls on it in desperation.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Now look, Nancy, don't push
                      it.  You've already rubbed my nose
                      in sex, drugs and violence -- don't
                      start throwing in insanity!

      NANCY takes that one to heart.  She wheels on him and pleads, her
      intensity sobering even to him.

                                      NANCY
                      Just go back and check -- please!

      The man takes a beat, then shrugs and nods towards SGT GARCIA.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Okay, Garcia.  What the hell.

                                      SGT GARCIA
                      Right...
                              (feeling in his pockets)
                      Now where'd I put the key...

      He mumbles backs towards his desk.  MUSIC BUILDS as we HOLD ON
      NANCY'S FACE.


101.  INT.  ROD'S CELL.  NIGHT.                                          101.

      With a terrible SNAP ROD's sheet jerks tight around his neck.
      The startled teenager is hauled upright -- eyes popping, face
      purple.  He claws at the sheet, but despite his strength he can't
      get his fingers between the noose and his windpipe.  He's dragged
      backwards across the cot.


102.  INT.  BOOKING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        102.

      GARCIA finally has the keys.  Urged on by NANCY he fumbles with
      the lock.


103.  INT.  ROD'S CELL.  NIGHT.                                          103.

      ROD'S being dragged backwards, gasping and struggling in vain
      against the powerful pull -- right across his cell and up the
      wall, too.  He clutches blindly at his throat at the far end of
      the sheet coils around the bars of the high window.  Then there's
      a powerful wrench of the sheet, and ROD'S neck SNAPS.  The kid's
      body sags lifeless.

104.  ANGLE THROUGH THE BARS as NANY, GLEN, LT THOMPSON and GARCIA       104.
      appear in the corridor outside, the girl sprinting ahead.

                                      NANCY
                      Rod!

      But it's too late; NANCY sinks back in horror as her father and
      GARCIA rush into the cell.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Gimme a hand, dammit!

      GLEN, pale as the sheet that's killed ROD, climbs to the bars and
      unties the knot.  ROD slides down over the SERGEANT'S shoulders,
      limp as a marrionette with its strings slashed.

                                      SGT GARCIA
                      Goddamn loco kid -- he didn't
                      have t'do that -- Madre dios!

      They lay ROD at NANCY's feet; a strange Pieta.  NANCY's father
      looks at her in spooked suspicion.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      How'd you know he was gonna do
                      this?

      NANCY says nothing.

                                              FADE TO BLACK


105.  EXT.  FOREST LAWN CEMETERY.  DAY.                                  105.

                                              BURN ON:

                              THE FOURTH DAY

      FADE UP ON a stark afternoon.  On a hill of sere grass
      overlooking the valley, the casket of ROD LANE is lowered into
      its grave.

      A small group of FAMILY and FRIENDS watches soberly as the
      MINISTER raises his hand in benediction.

                                      MINISTER
                      Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
                      May God be with this young man's
                      soul.

      ON THE FACES of MARGE, LT THOMPSON, TINA'S MOTHER and ROD'S
      PARENTS.  Just for a second or two, in looks too rapid for an
      outsider to even notice, these adults exchange looks.  Furtive,
      quick glances that suggest an immense something that they all
      share, something beyond even this second death among their
      children.  Then they are all staring ahead again, as if the
      others weren't even there.

                                      MINISTER (CONTD OS)
                      His life and his death attest to
                      the Scripture's warning that he who
                      lives by the sword shall die by
                      the sword.

      ANGLE ON GLEN, watching --

      NANCY, standing alone, not believing it for a minute.

                                      MINISTER (CONTD OS)
                      But let us recall also our Lord's
                      admonition that we 'Judge not,
                      lest we be judged.'  Let us
                      attempt only to love.  And may
                      Rod Lane rest in peace.

                                      NANCY
                              (quietly)
                      Amen to that much.

      The mourners walk away from the grave, MARGE among them.  She
      pauses near a MAN and two WOMEN in black -- TINA'S MOTHER, ROD'S
      PARENTS.  They almost, it seems, speak.  Then MARGE hurries on.

      WE MOVE WITH HER as she's joined by LT THOMPSON.  Both are worn
      and on edge.  THOMPSON absently lights another cigarette,
      offering one to MARGE.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      How's Nancy doing?

                                      MARGE
                      I don't think she's slept since
                      Tina died.
                              (shakes her head)
                      She's always been a delicate
                      kid.

      THOMPSON lights her cigarette, attempting some sort of
      nonchalance.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      She's tougher than you think.
                      Any idea how she knew Rod was
                      gonna kill himself?

                                      MARGE
                      No.  All I know is, this reminds
                      me too much of ten years ago.

      THOMPSON blows a plume of smoke against the hard sky and looks
      away.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Yeah.  Well... Let's not start
                      digging up bodies just because 
                      we're in a cemetery.

      He gives her a look that could cut stone.  MARGE toses down her
      cigarete and crosses to NANCY.  The girl is simply staring off
      over the valley.

                                      MARGE
                              (very gently)
                      Time to go home, baby.

      She moves her away from the brink of the hill.


106.  EXT.  CEMETERY PARKING AREA.  DAY.                                 106.

      MARGE opens the door of the station wagon for NANCY.  NANCY turns
      to them both, speaking in a still, small voice.

                                      NANCY
                      The killer's still loose,
                      you know.

      She has a wild, Cassandra aspect that sends a chill right up
      MARGE'S spine.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      You saying somebody else killed
                      Tina?  Who?

      NANCY smiles a weird sort of smile.

                                      NANCY
                      I don't know who he is.  But he's
                      burned, he wears a weird hat, a
                      red and yellow sweater, real
                      dirty, and he uses some sort of
                      knifes he's got made into a sort
                      of... glove.  Like giant finger-
                      nails.

      As NANCY has described this monster from her dream, unseen by
      her, 	the faces of MARGE LT and THOMPSON have drained completely
      of color.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                              (low, even, to MARGE)
                      I think you should keep Nancy
                      at home a few days.  'Til she's
                      really over the shock.

                                      MARGE
                      I got something better...
                              (to NANCY)
                      I'm gonna get you help, baby.
                      So no one will threaten you
                      any more.

      She takes the girl by the arm and guides her into the car,
      locking the door from outside.  NANCY never taking her eyes from
      her father's as the car bears her away.

                                              FADE TO BLACK

                              THE FIFTH DAY


107.  EXT.  UCLA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE.  DAY.                               107.

      FADE UP ON UCLA's WESTWOOD CAMPUS and PAN TO SIGN:

                              UCLA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE
                                 INSTITUTE FOR THE
                             STUDY OF SLEEP DISORDERS


108.  INT.  A LABORATORY SLEEPING CHAMBER.                               108.

      A NURSE applies sencors to the head, breast, arms, and fingers of
      NANCY THOMPSON.  The girl is lying on a simple broad cot, in her
      pajamas.  The room is subdued in color and holds only this single
      bed.  A large mirror set into one wall hides an observation room
      beyond.

                                      NANCY
                      But I just don't feel... ready
                      to sleep yet.  Please, do I
                      have to?

109.  WIDER, REVEALING DR SAMUEL KING, a young, curly-haired internist;  109.
      intelligent and wry.  He treats NANCY at all times like a young
      adult, never patronizing.  He winks as the NURSE finishes.

                                      DR KING
                      Don't worry, you're not gonna
                      change into Bride of Frankenstein
                      or anything.

      NANCY manages a smile, but she's haggard and visibly thinner.
      MARGE, background, looks downright distraught.

                                      DR KING (CONTD)
                      Nancy have any severe childhood
                      illnesses?  Scarlet Fever?
                      High temperatures -- concussions?

                                      MARGE
                      No, nothing.

                                      NANCY
                      He means, did you ever drop me
                      on my head.

      The doctor and girl share a nervous laugh; MARGE doesn't even
      smile.

                                      DR KING
                      Nightmares are expected after
                      psychological trauma.  Don't
                      worry, they go away.

                                      MARGE
                      I sure as hell hope so.

                                      NANCY	
                      I don't see why you couldn't
                      just give me a pill to keep me
                      from dreaming...

                                      DR KING
                      Everyone's got to dream.  
                      If you don't dream, you go...
                              (he drills his finger
                               at his temple)
                      All set?

                                      NANCY
                      No.

                                      MARGE
                      They're just simple tests, 
                      Nan.  We'll both be right
                      here.

                                      DR KING
                      Look, I know it's been fright-
                      ening, I know your dreams have
                      seemed real.  But... it's 
                      okay.  Okay?

                                      MARGE
                      Please, Nancy.  Trust us.

      The girls gauges her mother, the doctor, the situation very
      carefully.  Then lowers her eyes.

                                      NANCY
                      It's not you I don't trust.
                      It's...
                              (gives up)
                      Okay.  Let's do it.

      Greatly relieved, MARGE gives NANCY a goodnight kiss, then
      follows the doctor through a doorway near the mirror.  As soon as
      her mother is out of sight, NANCY'S eyes drift to the mirror
      itself.  In its reflection she sees herself looking back, alone
      on the bed.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:

	
110.  INT.  THE OBSERVATION ROOM.                                        110.

      MARGE and DR KING overlook NANCY's sleeping chamber through the
      one-way mirror.  And KING monitors the girl even more closely
      with a bank of instruments -- a mass of glowing dials, graphs and
      meters.  His manner with MARGE is slightly more sober.

                                      DR KING
                      How long's this been going on?

                                      MARGE
                      Since the murder.  She was fine
                      before that.

                                      DR KING
                      Not to worry.  No signs of path-
                      ology in Nancy's EEG or pulse
                      rate.  I'd guess what we've got
                      is a normal young girl who just
                      happens to have gone through
                      two days of hell.

                                      MARGE
                      It's just made her think...
                      her dreams are real...

      KING adjusts a dial, watching the EKG like a hawk.

                                      DR KING
                      Ever hear the old Buddhist tale
                      about the King who dreamed he 
                      was a beggar who dreamed he 
                      was a king?

      MARGE twitches.  Then there's a slight alteration in the sound of
      the EKG.  KING nods in satisfaction.

                                      DR KING (CONTD)
                      Okay, good.  She's asleep.

                                      MARGE
                              (immensely relieved)
                      Thank God.

      MUSIC RISES SOLEMNLY, MAJESTICALLY into a haunting transition as
      we

                                              DISSOLVE TO

111.  A MONTAGE OF SHOTS, of the EKG GRAPH, its inky needles calming,    111.
      of a METER tracing the quieting of NANCY's pulse, and of OTHER
      INSTRUMENTS, indicating life processes we can only guess.  All
      smoothing out.

112.  CLOSE ON NANCY on TV MONITOR, asleep like the child she is.        112.
      Innocent.

      MARGE lights a cigarette, angry at her helplessness.

                                      MARGE
                      What the hell are dreams, anyway?

                                      DR KING
                      Mysteries.  Incredible body
                      hookus pokus.  Truth is we
                      still don't know what they
                      are or where they come from.
                      As for nightmares...
                              (leans closer)
                      Did you know that in the last 
                      three years twenty Philipino
                      refugees in California died
                      in the middle of nightmares?
                      Not from heart attacks, either.
                      They just died.

      He gives a "Ah don' know" shrug.  MARGE looks out into the
      sleeping room.  NANCY is a motionless bundle in the middle of the
      bed.

113.  ANGLE ON A NEEDLE on an EKG dipping to a lower reading.            113.

114.  WIDER ANGLE -- the mother and DOCTOR watching.                     114.

                                      MARGE
                      What happened?  That needle
                      sank like a rock.

                                      DR KING
                              (quietly)
                      She's entering deep sleep now.
                      Heart rate's a little high due
                      to anxiety, but otherwise she's
                      nicely relaxed.  All normal.
                      She could dream at any time now.
                              (beat)
                      Right now she's like a diver
                      on the bottom of an ocean no
                      one's mapped yet.  Waiting to	
                      see what shows up.


115.  INT.  THE SLEEPING ROOM.                                           115.

      We can see NANCY drift from the initial stage, over the
      brink into deep sleep.  Her hair falls into her eyes; her face
      relaxes; her shoulders curl round her like comforters.  THE MUSIC
      DEEPENS, and begins to hint at the tones of the NIGHTMARE THEME.


116.  INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.                                          116.

      DR KING and MARGE watch the instruments' every move.

      One of the machines begins a slight CHIRPING.  KING scans it,
      liking what he sees.

                                      DR KING
                      Okay, she's started to dream.

      He leans forward in his chair, like a pilot starting an
      instrument approach.  MARGE THOMPSON licks her dry lips, fighting
      a turn of nausea.

                                      MARGE
                      How can you tell?

                                      DR KING
                      R.E.M.'s.  Rapid eye movements.
                      The eyes follow the
                      dream -- their movement picks
                      up on this --

      He prods a dial with his pencil and scribbles the time on a note
      pad.

                                      DR KING (CONTD)
                      Beta Waves are slowing, too.
                      She's dreaming, all right.
                      A good one, too.

      MARGE watches the TV MONITOR.  It's in extra-close on NANCY's
      eyes -- and they're darting beneath the lids, reacting to events
      lost behind a skein of flesh and neurons.

      KING points to a moving graph.  A needle's begun waving lazily
      between plus and minus three.  The DOCTOR nods, assured.

                                      DR KING (CONTD)
                      Typical dream parameter.  A
                      nightmare, now, would be plus or
                      minus five or six; she's just 
                      around three point --

      He stops.  Outside, visible through the glass, NANCY twists
      around.  Eyes still closed, she's nevertheless holding her head
      in the attitude of prey listening to the first faint sound of the
      predator's approach.

      MARGE looks from her daughter to the DOCTOR, color draining from
      her face.

                                      MARGE
                      What the hell's this?  She
                      awake or asleep?

      The needle of the graph gives a jagged pitch up, plunges, then
      surges well above the eight mark.  A strange MUSIC CUE --
      disonant and threatening, creeps in -- the NIGHTMARE THEME
      slurred into awful minors and weird disonance.  KING stares at
      the gauge in disbelief, rapping his finger on its glass.

                                      DR KING
                      Can't be.  It never gets
                      this high...

      The needle swings even higher, benind.

                                      DR KING (CONTD)
                      Jesus H. Christ.

      He's cut off by the high-pitched KEENING of the girl, the SOUND
      cutting through the double thickness of the glass like a lasar.
      A warning BEEPER has begun, the instruments light up like a
      Christmas tree -- and outside in the sleeping room, NANCY is
      contorting as if shot through with a thousand volts.  KING knocks
      over his chair in his sprint for the door.


117.  INT.  SLEEPING ROOM.                                               117.

      The DOCTOR and MARGE come in on the run -- NANCY's flailing and
      screaming as if the devil himself were after her.  KING grabs her
      to shake her awake;

      ANGLE ON NANCY (eyes open) -- looking in terror -- SOUND ECHOED
      STRANGELY.

      IN HER POV -- dressed in KING'S clothes -- the horribly scarred
      MAN reaches out.

      WIDER -- (NANCY'S eyes closed in sleep) as the girl's fist shoots
      out with incredible force and knocks DR KING flying!

      The NURSE and MARGE both descend on her --

      and again in her SLEEPING POV we see the MAN stagger for her.

      WIDER ON NANCY -- (still in her nightmare) -- fighting like a
      tiger with both MARGE and the NURSE -- sending the NURSE
      sprawling -- leaving MARGE hanging on for dear life.

      ANGLE on the stunned DOCTOR fumbling with a hyperdermic needle,
      spilling most of the stuff on himself with his shaking hands --
      the SCREAMS AND CURSES of NANCY are deafening and worthy of a
      stevador fighting off his worst enemy.  Stranger still, her hair
      is electrified, standing on end and greying before their very
      eyes!

      MARGE screams at the top of her lungs.

                                      MARGE
                      NANCY!!!  IT'S MOM -- NANCY!!!!

      Some deep bolt of psychic power smacks through the girl, and her
      eyes flap open -- they're glazed with terror and fury, but open.
      NANCY's awake.

      She stares around like a cornered animal in the middle of the
      bed, her purple face gasping out gut-wrenching SOBS.  The NURSE
      and MARGE dare to go back in and hold the sweat-drenched girl as
      DR KING comes for her with the needle.

                                      DR KING
                      Now, this is just going to let
                      you relax and sleep, Nan --

      With incredible swiftness, NANCY backhands the hypodermic into a
      far wall, shattering it into a million pieces.

                                      NANCY
                      No.  That's enough sleep.

      Her eyes are windows straight into white fire as she locks into
      KING'S face.  He dabs his split lip, swallowing painfully.

                                      DR KING
                      Okay, kid.  Okay.  Fair enough.

      He holds out his hand.  NANCY at last takes it, and sags back
      into her pillow, exhausted.  Then KING comes up with blood on his
      hand.

      He stares at it, dumbfounded, then at the girl.  Across her left
      forearm, a deep gash is bleeding freely, as if made by a very
      sharp instrument.

                                      MARGE
                      Oh my god, oh my god...

                                      DR KING
                              (to the NURSE)
                      Get the kit!

      The NURSE scrambles away as the DOCTOR claps his hand over the
      wounds.  He looks into NANCY's face.  What he sees frightens him
      even more: NANCY'S haunted, ghost-like eyes turn from him to her
      mother, and a terrible, chilling smile opens across NANCY's white
      lips.

                                      NANCY
                      You believe this?

      She pulls her free arm from beneath the sheets and reveals a
      strange hat, filthy and worn -- the KILLER'S hat.  The sight of
      it frightens MARGE more than anything that's come before.

                                      MARGE
                              (deathly pale)
                      Where the hell did you get that?

      NANCY fixes her with Xray eyes.

                                      NANCY
                      I grabbed it off his head.

      MARGE stares at the hat as if it held her whole future, and her
      future was a horror.

                                              FADE TO BLACK


118.  EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE.  DAY.                                         118.

                                                      BURN ON

                              THE SIXTH DAY

      FADE UP ON NANCY'S HOUSE, early morning.


119.  INT.  NANCY'S KITCHEN.  DAY.                                       119.

      MARGE is on the telephone, the dirty hat in her hand.  Nearby is
      a nearly empty bottle of gin.

                                      MARGE
                      She said she snatched it off
                      his head in a dream.
                              (listens)
                      No, I'm not crazy, I've got
                      the damn thing in my hand!
                              (listens)
                      I know we did, we all...
                              (hears NANCY 
                               approaching)
                      Gotta go.

      She hangs up and stuffs the hat and bottle into a drawer,
      screening the action with her body.  NANCY enters.

      By now the girl has an extraordinary look.  Her hair is ashen,
      her skin transluscent, and eyes dark-ringed.  Her right forearm
      is heavily bandaged over the slashes.  In short, instead of the
      girl next door, we now could be looking at the lunatic from the
      next cell.  MARGE, though she does her best to hide it, is
      downright frightened of her.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      You didn't sleep, did you?
                      The doctor says you have to 
                      sleep or you'll --

      NANCY pours herself a cup of black coffee.

                                      NANCY
                      Go even crazier?

                                      MARGE
                      I don't think you're going
                      crazy -- and stop drinking
                      that damn coffee!

                                      NANCY
                      Did you ask Daddy to have the 
                      hat examined?

                                      MARGE
                      I threw that filthy thing away --
                      I don't know what you're trying 
                      to prove with it, but --

      NANCY comes closer, her eyes shining with a new sureness.

                                      NANCY
                      What I learned at the dream
                      clinic, that's what I'm trying
                      to prove.  Rod didn't kill Tina, 
                      and he didn't hang himself.
                      It's this guy -- he's after
                      us in our dreams.

                                      MARGE
                      But that's just not reality,
                      Nancy!

120.  Furious, NANCY janks open the drawer before MARGE can stop her     120.
      and spills the bottle and hat onto the counter.

      MARGE grabs away the bottle protectively -- but it's the hat
      NANCY goes for.  She waves it triumphantly -- demonically. 

                                      NANCY
                      It's real, Mamma.  Feel it.

                                      MARGE
                              (horrified)
                      Put that damned thing down!

      MARGE lunges for it -- NANCY leaps out of reach --

                                      NANCY
                      His name is even in it -- written 
                      right in here -- Fred Krueger --
                      Fred Krueger!  You know who that
                      is, Mamma?  You better tell me,
                      cause now he's after me!

      MARGE swallows, then persists in the lie.

                                      MARGE
                      Nancy, trust your mother for 
                      once -- you'll feel better as 
                      soon as you sleep!

      NANCY shoots a hard humorless laugh, holding up her slashed arm.

                                      NANCY
                      You call this feeling better?
                      Or should I grab a bottle and
                      veg out with you -- avoid 
                      everything happening to me
                      by just getting good and loaded --

      MARGE slaps her hard.

                                      MARGE
                              (losing it)
                      Fred Krueger can't be after you,
                      Nancy -- he's dead!

      The room falls silent, both women staring at the other.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                              (low, raw)
                      Fred Krueger is dead.  Dead and
                      gone.  Believe me, I know.  Now
                      go to bed.  I order you, go to 
                      bed.

      MARGE snatches the hat away.  NANCY is furious, betrayed.

                                      NANCY
                      You knew about him all
                      this time, and you've been acting
                      like he was someone I made up!

      MARGE pulls away.

                                      MARGE
                      You're sick, Nancy.  Imagining 
                      things.  You need to sleep,
                      it's as simple as that.

      NANCY wheels and smashes MARGE'S bottle of gin in the sink.

                                      NANCY
                      Screw sleep!

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      Nancy!

      But NANCY runs past her mother for the front door.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      Nancy -- it's only a nightmare!

      NANCY turns in the doorway.

                                      NANCY
                      That's enough!

      On the door SLAM, we

                                              CUT TO


121.  EXT.  SHAKESPEARE BRIDGE.  DAY.                                    121.

      ANGLE ON A NEIGHBORHOOD STREET.  We hear GLEN's VOICE and PAN UP
      to REVEAL NANCY and GLEN high above, two tiny figures walking
      across this strange white bridge in old Los Angeles.  CAMERA
      BEGINS A SLOW ZOOM.

                                      GLEN
                      Whenever I get nervous I eat.

                                      NANCY
                      And if you can't do that, you
                      sleep.

                                      GLEN
                      Used to.  Not anymore.

      GLEN jams more Big Mack into his face.  By now our ZOOM reveals
      he's attacking a huge bag of Big Macks, and furtively eyeing
      NANCY.  The girl's hair is startlingly white in the sunlight.
      She's reading a book, hardly paying attention.

                                      GLEN (CONTD)
                      You ever read about the Balinese
                      way of dreaming?

                                      NANCY
                      No.

                                      GLEN
                      They got a whole system they
                      call 'dream skills'.  So, if
                      you have a nightmare, for 
                      instance like falling, right?

                                      NANCY
                      Yeah.

                                      GLEN
                      Instead of screaming and getting 
                      nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna
                      make up my mind that I fall
                      into a magic world where I can
                      get something special, like a 
                      poem or song.
                              (grins hopefully)
                      They get all their art literature
                      from dreams.  Just wake up and 
                      write it down.  Dreamskills.

      He stops, seeing the look on NANCY's face.  Our ZOOM is much
      closer now, a wide medium, and still coming in on the kids.

                                      NANCY
                      And what if they meet a monster
                      in their dream?  Then what?

                                      GLEN
                      They turn their back on it.
                              (grins hopefully)
                      Takes away its energy, and
                      it disappears.

                                      NANCY
                      What happens if they don't do
                      that?

                                      GLEN
                              (shrugs)
                      I guess those people don't
                      wake up to tell what happens.

                                      NANCY
                      Great.

      She leans over the railing, poking her face back into her book.
      GLEN tips its cover and reads its title.  OUR ZOOM IS STILL
      MOVING CLOSER, a MEDIUM CLOSE UP NOW.
 
                                      GLEN
                      'Booby Traps and Improvised 
                      Anti-personel Devices'!

                                      NANCY
                      I found it at this neat
                      survivalist bookstore on
                      Ventura.

                                      GLEN
                              (shocked)
                      Well what you reading it for?

      OUR ZOOM LOCKS IN ON A TIGHT TWO ON THEIR FACES, NANCY's grimly
      determined.

                                      NANCY
                      I'm into survival.

      She walks away, OUT OF FRAME, leaving GLEN watching after her in
      astonishment.

                                      GLEN
                      She's starting to scare the
                      living shit out of me.


122.  EXT. ELM STREET/NANCY'S HOME/EVENING                               122.

      ANGLE ACROSS NANCY'S "TREE LAWN", the grass between
      the sidewalk and the street, in the general direction
      of GLEN's home.  This ANGLE doesn't quite reveal
      Nancy's house.

      FOREGROUND is a utility truck in which a half dozen
      Hispanic WORKERS are loading tools, extension cords
      and hardware.  They
      look like they've put in one hell of a hard day's work.

      MARGE appears and hands a check to the FOREMAN of the crew, a
      white guy in clean coveralls and a gold chain.  He scrutinizes
      it.

                                      FOREMAN
                      And the other...

      MARGE forks over a wad of cash, hands trembling in her
      half-drunk, helpless rage.

                                      MARGE
                      Where's your mask and gun?

      The FOREMAN counts the money swiftly.

                                      FOREMAN
                      Don't bust my chops, lady.
                      If the city found out I put
                      'em in without inside releases
                      I'd loose my license.

      He shoves the money in his pocket and climbs in his truck.  MARGE
      EXITS FRAME for her house.

      PAN WITH THE TRUCK as it pulls away, THEN PICK UP NANCY, walking
      across the street from the corner.  Alone.  Dispirited.  She
      lifts her eyes to her home and stops in her tracks.

                                      NANCY
                      Oh gross...

123.  WIDENING TO REVEAL THE HOUSE as NANCY walks across her front       123.
      yard.  Every single window has been covered with brand-new
      ornamental iron bars, bolted deeply into their frames.

      CLOSER, AT A WINDOW.  NANCY gives a set of bars a powerful
      shake.  They don't budge.  Then girl looks up and sees even the
      window to her second floor bedroom is barred.  And the rose
      trellis has been ripped down and heaped at the foundation in a
      tangle of wood, thorns and broken flowers.


124.  INT.  MARGE'S ROOM.  EVENING.                                      124.

      ANGLE ON THE DOORWAY INTO THE HALL.  Easy listening MUSIC wafts
      through the air.  NANCY appears in the doorway.

                                      NANCY (OS)
                      Mom, what's with the bars!?

125.  REVERSE to MARGE, propped against the headboard of her bed, a      125.
      crooked shadow in the gloom.  A fresh bottle of Gin glints in her
      hand.

                                      NANCY
                      Oh, Mom...

      The girl crosses and reaches gently for the bottle.  MARGE
      snatches it away.

                                      MARGE
                      'S'mine...

      She rocks the bottle in her arms.

                                      NANCY
                      What's with the bars?

                                      MARGE
                      S'curity.

      NANCY sits on the bed, a surprising compassion entering her
      voice.

                                      NANCY
                      Mom, I want to know what you
                      know about Fred Krueger.

                                      MARGE
                      Dead and gone.

                                      NANCY
                      I want to know how, where --
                      if you don't tell me, I'm going
                      to call daddy.

      MARGE gives a laugh -- a rasping chachination from deep in her
      chest.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      Your father the cop.  That's a
                      good one.
                              (colder)
                      Forget Fred Krueger.  You don't
                      want to know, believe me.

                                      NANCY
                      I do want to know.  He's not
                      dead and gone -- he's after me
                      and if I sleep he'll get me!
                      I've got to know!

      MARGE blinks at her a moment, then cracks a terrible, crooked
      grin.

                                      MARGE
                      All right.


126.  INT. NANCY'S CELLAR/NIGHT                                          126.

      MARGE drags NANCY headlong down the cellar stairs and across the
      room with a crazy fury, twisting her down near the foundation.
      And she thrusts her face so close to her daughter's that NANCY
      reels from the alcohol.

                                      MARGE
                      You want to know who Fred
                      Krueger was?  He was a filthy
                      child killer who got at least
                      twenty kids, kids from our
                      area, kids we all knew.  It
                      drove us all crazy when we
                      didn't know who was doing it --
                      but it was even worse when
                      they caught him.

      MARGE draws herself up with a shake.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      Oh lawyers got fat and the judge
                      got famous, but someone forgot to
                      sign the search warrant in the 
                      right place, and Fred Krueger
                      was free, just like that.

                                      NANCY
                      So he's alive?

      MARGE smiles grimly.

                                      MARGE
                      He wouldn've stopped.  The 
                      bastard would've got more
                      kids first chance he got --
                      they found nearly ten bodies
                      in his boiler room as it
                      was.  But the law couldn't
                      touch him.

      At the mention of "boiler room", NANCY gives a shake.  MARGE
      misses this, too busy taking a pull on the bottle that's never
      left her hand.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      What was needed were some private
                      citizens willing to do what had
                      to be done.

      She reels slowly, looking at NANCY is defiance.

                                      NANCY
                              (hushed)
                      What did you do, mother?

      MARGE cradles the bottle.

                                      MARGE
                      Bunch of us parents tracked him
                      down after they let him go.  Found
                      him in an old boiler room, just
                      like before.  Saw him lying there
                      in that caked red and yellow sweater
                      he always wore, drunk an' asleep
                      with his weird knives by his side...

                                      NANCY
                              (dreading it)
                      Go on...

      MARGE reaches over and taps a dusty two-gallon jug of gasoline
      near the lawn mower.

                                      MARGE
                      We poured gasoline all around
                      the place, left a trail out the 
                      door, locked the door, then...

      She mimes striking a match --

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      WHOOSH!!!

      Her arms shoot up and her eyes go wide with the light of that
      fire.  There's awe in her voice.  Then she drops her arms.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                              (hushed, remembering)
                      But just when it seemed not
                      even the devil could live
                      in there any more -- he crashed
                      out like a banshee, all on fire
                      -- swinging those fingerknives
                      every which direction and 
                      screaming he... he was going
                      to get us by killing all our
                      kids...

      She stops with a sudden quake and drinks for a long moment.  But
      the intake doesn't hide the image.  Her face bathed in tears, she
      looks at her daughter and shakes her head.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      There were all those men, Nancy,
                      even your father, oh yes, even
                      him.  But none could do what
                      had to be done -- Krueger rolling 
                      and screaming so loud the whole
                      state could hear -- no one could
                      take your father's gun and kill 
                      him good and proper except me.

      She sweeps her hand across the air in a terrific slash, then
      stops, her hand shaking, her voice hoarse and terrified.  She
      looks at her daughter, begging.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      So he's dead Nan.  He can't
                      get you.  Mommy killed him.

	For someone who started this film at a very young seventeen,
      NANCY's now the battle-tempered veteran as she takes her mother
      in her arms and rocks her.

                                      NANCY
                      Who was there?  Were Tina's 
                      parents there?  Were Rod's?

      MARGE sags back.

                                      MARGE
                      Sure, and Glen's.  All of us.
                      But that's in the past now,
                      baby.  Really.  It's over.
                              (slyly)
                      We even took his knives.

      The woman twists around and opens the door on an old furnace -- a
      furnace unused since the newer gas one nearby was put in.  She
      fishes inside the cavity -- as then we hear a touch of the
      familiar 'SCRRIITCH'.  Next moment she pulls out an object
      wrapped in rags, opens it and displays the long, rusted blades
      and their glove-like apparatus.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      See?

      NANCY stares at the damn things, chilled.

                                      NANCY
                      All these years you've kept those
                      things buried down here?  In our
                      own house?

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      Proof he's declawed.  As for him,
                      we buried him good and deep.

      MARGE shoves the knives into their hiding place, closes the
      little iron door.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      So's okay, you can sleep.

      She lurches up and staggers upstairs.

      NANCY shivers and looks down at her arm.  The cut beneath her
      bandage has begun to bleed again.  And from inside the furnace,
      as if from deep below, the PULSING of the boundless
      nightmare-boiler room can be faintly heard.


127.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          127.

      WIDE ON THE STREET AND BOTH HOUSES, GLEN's on the right, NANCY's
      on the left.  A TELEPHONE RINGS.  ZOOM IN ON GLEN'S UPSTAIRS
      BEDROOM WINDOW.


128.  INT.  GLEN'S & NANCY'S BEDROOMS - INTERCUT.  NIGHT.                128.

129.  GLEN, yawning, crosses and picks up his telephone.                 129.

                                      GLEN
                      Hello?

                                      NANCY (telephone)
                      Hi.

                                      GLEN
                      Oh.  Hi, how y'doing?

      NANCY looks out the window and touches her hair.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Fine.  Stand by your window
                      so I can see you.  You sound
                      a million miles away.

      In the lighted window across the way, she can SEE GLEN move into
      sight.  In his shot, we can SEE NANCY step into her window behind
      the bars.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Much better.

                                      GLEN
                      I heard your ma went ape at the 
                      security store today.  You look
                      like the Prisoner of Zenda or
                      something.  How long's it been 
                      since you slept?

                                      NANCY
                      Coming up on the seventh day.  It's
                      okay, I checked Guiness.  The 
                      record's eleven, and I'll beat 
                      that if I have to.
                              (beat)
                      Listen, I... I know who he is.

                                      GLEN
                      Who?

                                      NANCY
                      The killer.

                                      GLEN
                      You do?

                                      NANCY
                      Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm
                      pretty sure you're next.

      GLEN is appalled.

                                      GLEN
                      Me!?  Why would anyone want to
                      kill me?!

                                      NANCY
                      Don't ask -- just give me some
                      help nailing this guy when I
                      bring him out.

      GLEN pales.

                                      GLEN
                      Bring him out of what?

                                      NANCY
                      My dream.

                                      GLEN
                      How you plan to do that?

                                      NANCY
                      Just like I did the hat.  Have
                      a hold of the sucker when you
                      wake me up.

                                      GLEN
                      Me?
                              (switching back to a more
                               comfortable reality)
                      Wait a minute, you can't bring
                      someone out of a dream!

                                      NANCY
                      If I can't, then you all can
                      relax, because it'll just be a
                      simple case of me being nuts.

                                      GLEN
                      I can save you the trouble.
                      You're nutty as a fruitcake.
                      I love you anyway.

                                      NANCY
                      Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking
                      this guy when I bring him out.

                                      GLEN
                      What!?

                                      NANCY
                              (simplicity itself)
                      You heard me.  I grab him in the
                      dream -- you see me struggling 
                      so you wake me up.  We both come
                      out, you cold cock the fucker,
                      and we got him.  Clever, huh?

                                      GLEN
                      You crazy?  Hit him with what?

                                      NANCY
                      You're a jock.  You must have
                      a baseball bat or something.
                      Come to my window at midnight.
                      And meanwhile...

                                      GLEN
                              (weakly)
                      Meanwhile..?

                                      NANCY
                      Meanwhile whatever you do
                      don't fall asleep.  Midnight.

      She hangs up.  GLEN's eyes bug out.

                                      GLEN
                      Holy shit!  Midnight.  Baseball
                      bats and boogemen.  Unfucking
                      real.


130.  OMIT                                                          OMIT 130.

131.  EXT.  THE VALLEY AND HILLS.  NIGHT.                                131.

      HIGH, WIDE SHOT.  The moon is above the horizon.  A cool wind
      slides a bank of white fog inland.  The valley and its lights
      stretch forever, an endless net of illumination and darkness.  A
      coyote HOWLS on the dark hill.


132.  EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      132.

      A palm frond scuttles across the center of the parking lot.  LT
      THOMPSON arrives in an unmarked car.

                                      COP (passing)
                      Lieutenant Thompson -- what
                      you doing in at this time?

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Can't sleep, thought I'd come
                      break up the poker game.

      The COP laughs and goes his way.  THOMPSON's smile evaporates.

	
133.  INT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      133.

      THOMPSON enters and checks the log.  Nearby, SGT GARCIA pours
      coffee.

                                      SERGEANT GARCIA
                      If it was any more quiet we
                      could hear owls farting.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Is quiet, isn't it?

                                      SERGEANT GARCIA
                              (too casually)
                      How's your girl?

      THOMPSON looks at the Desk sergeant a moment, then tosses down
      the log.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      She's sensible.  She'll sleep
                      sooner or later.


134.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          134.

      The neighborhood is utterly still, most of the homes already
      dark.  But not NANCY's.  Or GLEN's.

      ZOOM TO GLEN'S LIGHTED LIVING ROOM WINDOW.


135.  INT.  GLEN'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  135.

      GLEN's father watches eleven o'clocks news, a dreary FILM CLIP
      (STOCK) of war and refugees in a far-away land.

      MR LANTZ takes a pull on his Bud.

                                      MR LANTZ
                      You'd think they'd have some-
                      thing 'bout the Lane kid hanging
                      himself.

      MRS LANTZ walks through the room, drying her hands on a
      dishtowel.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      Maybe we're all making more out
                      of it than we should.

      She heads upstairs.  MR LANTZ pops the automatic tuner.  CARSON
      blinks ON.

                                      CARSON (TV)
                      I wouldn't touch that line with
                      a ten foot pole.

      ED MCMAHON and the AUDIENCE laugh in delight.


136.  INT.  GLEN'S HOUSE/UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR.  NIGHT.                      136.

      MRS LANTZ comes along the upstairs hall and knocks gently at a
      closed door.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      Glen?  you all right?

      She puts her ear to the door and listens.

                                      MRS LANTZ (CONTD)
                      Glen honey?

      No answer.


137.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         137.

      GLEN lies sprawled across the bed, long legs flung over the end,
      head not visible.

      His mother enters.  She looks at the boy, turns off the TV.
                                                   Looks at him again.
      From this angle she can see his head, earphones crammed over it
      rasping their tinny noise.  But no movement from the kid at all.
      MRS LANTZ crosses and pokes him in the ribs.  GLEN lurches up,
      arms windmilling.

                                      GLEN
                      Whuu?

      He refocuses his eyes, takes off his earphones.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      How can you listen to Carson and
                      a record at the same time?

      GLEN swings his legs over the edge of the bed and shakes his head
      to clear the cobwebs.

                                      GLEN
                      Wasn't listening to the tube,
                      just watching.  Miss Nude
                      America's supposed to be on
                      tonight.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      Well how you gonna hear what
                      she says?

                                      GLEN
                      Who cares what she says?

      The mother gives up.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      You should get to sleep soon, 
                      Glen.  It's almost midnight.
                      Goodness knows we've all had
                      enough of a time the last few
                      days...

                                      GLEN
                      I will, Mom...in a while.
                      You guys turning in?

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      Pretty soon.

      His MOTHER sighs and goes out, closing the door behind her.  GLEN
      flips the TV back on and glances at the clock.

138.  INSERT OF CLOCK.  It's 11:42.                                      138.

139.  TIGHT ON GLEN's face.  He clamps the earphones back on, and turns  139.
      the volume up high.  The MUSIC is so loud we can hear it
      resonating inside his skull.

      CAMERA MOVES PAST GLEN to his window, then ZOOMS through to:


140.  EXT.  ELM STREET / NANCY'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.                          140.

      CONTINUE ZOOMING into the LIGHTED window of NANCY's barred second
      floor bedroom and

                                                      CUT TO:

141.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT                                         141.

      CLOSE ON MARGE, weaving on the edge of NANCY's bed, stroking
      the girl's hair.  NANCY's still something of a wreck, but less
      than 	MARGE.

                                      MARGE
                      We'll go away, take a vacation.
                      Get your hair colored nice, the
                      way it was.  No one will ever
                      know.
                              (sniffs)
                      This whole room smells of coffee,
                      y'know?

      She gathers up NANCY's coffee cups and empty NoDoz boxes, leans
      down and kisses her.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      It's all over now, baby.  The
                      nightmare's over.  Please.

      NANCY nods her head, half stubborn, half sadly.  She can barely
      keep her eyes open now.

                                      NANCY
                      Okay.

      She scrunches into her pillow.  MARGE smiles haggardly and shuts
      off the light, taking the coffee pot with her as she leaves.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Night-night.

      MARGE smiles, relieved.  The girl pulls the blanket around her
      shoulders.  Her eyes flutter closed, her breathing becomes regular
      and deep.  Once again she's the litle girl MARGE fantasizes she
      is.

      The mother tiptoes out of the room, closing the door behind her.
      HOLD ON NANCY's sleeping face as the DOOR CLOSES.  Her eyes
      remain closed another beat, then open wide.

      She quietly jumps out of bed and shakes herself savagely to
      scatter the sleep settling so quickly.

      Still in the dark, she fishes a full electric coffepot from under
      her bed and pours herself a fresh fix into a mug she digs from
      beneath her pillow.  The face illuminated by the neon light on the
      pot is set in absolute determination.

      NANCY drains the cup, then crosses to her closet, retrieves a
      pitcher of ice water from behind a heap of clothes and splashes
      her eyes and the back of her neck.  That done she eases open her
      window and presses her face to the bars, sucking in cool night
      air until every shred of sleep is gone from her brain.

      Then she starts pulling on clothes.


142.  INT.  NANCY'S HOUSE/DOWNSTAIRS.  NIGHT.                            142.

      ANGLE ON MARGE as she checks the lock on the backdoor.  Firm.

143.  ANGLE IN THE LIVING ROOM as she pads through the darkened house,   143.
      feels her way to a wall of shelves and takes down a book.  Then
      another, and a third.  Then reaches in and fishes out a bottle of
      gin.


144.  EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE AND ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                        144.

      The sky has gathered in greater darkness.  LOW, DISTANT THUNDER
      rolls around the horizon like a great drum.

      ANGLE ON NANCY'S HOUSE from across the street.  The moon glints
      off the barred windows. CAMERA ZOOMS to NANCY's window.  The
      imprisoned girl hovers in the darkness behind the grill like a
      ghost, her eyes turned towards GLEN's.  Then she switches to
      something much CLOSER TO CAMERA ANGLE, and she draws back.

145.  REVERSE ON GLEN's father, standing on the front porch of his       145.
      home, also in the shadows, looking straight across and up at
      NANCY.  He 	draws on his cigarette; his face glows red.

146.  NANCY pulls down the shade.                                        146.

147.  GLEN's father grinds the cigarette beneath his shoe.               147.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      Shouldn't stare.

      As the man turns our SHOT WIDENS TO REVEAL MRS LANTZ.

                                      MR LANTZ
                      Know what I think?  I think 
                      that kid's some kinda lunatic.

      The woman spoons more sweetness into her mouth and rubs her
      forehead.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      Shouldn't say such a thing about
                      the poor child.  If you mean the 
                      bars, Marge's just being cautious,
                      her being alone and Nancy acting
                      so nervous lately.

      The woman rises and pulls him gently towards the living room.  As
      he goes inside he takes one last look.

                                      MR LANTZ (CONTD)
                      Well, she ain't gonna hang around
                      our boy no more.

      Once the two are inside, the door is locked.


148.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        148.

      CLOSE ON NANCY's face.  VERY CLOSE.  Her eyes stare ahead,
      red-rimmed, anxious.  She picks absently at the thick bandage
      covering her forearm.  The long cuts from Fred Krueger's fingers
      are bleeding again, but she doesn't even care anymore.  Too late
      to sweat the small stuff.  She crosses the room.

      On the bedside table with the nearly empty Pyrex coffee maker,
      the empty cup and the empty box of No-Doz, is her old fashioned
      alarm clock, and a phone.

      NANCY pours herself the last of the coffee and drinks it to the
      dregs, then looks to the clock.

      INSERT CLOCK -- ten minutes to midnight.

      NANCY'S eyes go to the door.

      WIDER.  Fully clothed and in a jacket now, she creeps to the door
      and cracks it, just to make sure.  Then freezes.


149.  INT.  HALLWAY OUTSIDE NANCY'S DOOR.                                149.

      IN NANCY'S POV through the door we see MARGE, rummaging around in
      the linen closet not fifteen feet away.  There's no way NANCY can
      get past her.  The woman pulls out a full bottle of gin in
      satisfaction and begins fumbling with its cap.


150.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        150.

      NANCY eases the door closed again and sinks to the key hole,
      watching through it with a sinking heart.

                                      NANCY
                              (very quiet, very intense)
                      Hang on GLEN...


151.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         151.

      GLEN, coat now on, goes to his window, checking.


152.  INT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          152.

      GLEN'S POV -- NANCY'S porch is deserted; front door closed,
      lights out.  No sign of NANCY.


153.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         153.

      GLEN shrugs, takes off his jacket and plops back onto his bed.

                                      GLEN
                      Well, I'm not gonna risk
                      sneaking out until she does.

      He puts the earphones back on.


154.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        154.

      Absolutely frustrated, NANCY turns from the keyhole to the
      window. She opens the blind and eases back the curtain.


155.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.

      IN NANCY'S POV THROUGH THE BARS we ZOOM directly across to GLEN's
      window.


156.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         156.

      GLEN lies on his bed, fully clothed, earphones over his ears,
      CARSON droning from the TV.  And the boy's eyes begin to droop.


157.  INT.  NANCY'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     157.

      NANCY picks up her phone, bites her lip, then begins dialing.


158.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         158.

      TIGHT ON PHONE as it begins RINGING loudly.

      WIDER SHOT, revealing GLEN asleep BACKGROUND, the MUSIC still
      LOUD in his earphones.


159.  INT.  GLEN'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  159.

      RINGING here, too, just as MR LANTZ is turning out the lights for
      bed.  He stops in the dark, scowling.

                                      MR LANTZ
                      Who at this hour?

      He refuses to turn the light back on.  His wife picks her way to
      the telephone.

                                      MRS LANTZ
                      Hello?
                              (listens, frowns
                               slightly)
                      Oh... Hold on.
                              (covers the mouthpiece)
                      It's her.  She wants to talk to
                      Glen.

      The father crosses to the telephone, suspicious.

                                      MR LANTZ
                              (whispering)
                      About what?

                                      MRS LANTZ
                              (into phone)
                      What's this about, Nancy?

      She listens, covers up again.

                                      MRS LANTZ (CONTD)
                      She says it's private.  Very 
                      private and very important.

      MR LANTZ grabs the telephone from his wife and barks into it.

                                      MR LANTZ
                      Glen's asleep.  Talk to him
                      tomorrow!

      He SLAMS down the telephone with a grunt of satisfaction to his
      wife.

                                      MR LANTZ (CONTD)
                      Just got to be firm with kids,
                      is all.

      Then as a refinement he takes the phone off the hook and lays it
      on the table.


160.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        160.

      NANCY dials again.  This time she gets a BUSY SIGNAL.  She slams
      the phone down in frustration and looks out the window.

                                      NANCY
                      Glen.  Don't fall asleep...

      She goes and sits on the bed, propping her chin on her fists.
161.  Yawns.  The TELEPHONE RINGS.                                       161.

      NANCY snatches it up.

                                      NANCY
                      Glen?

      TIGHT ON HER, ZOOMING EVEN CLOSER ON HER EAR AND THE EARPIECE as
      we HEAR the awful SCRITCHING SCRAPE of STEEL FINGERKNIVES.

      NANCY slaps the phone down as if it were diseased -- then, in
      pure rage, rips the thing's cord from the wall.

      Spent instantly, she puts the receiver back on the cradle and
      lays it on her bed, chiding herself.

                                      NANCY
                      Brilliant.  Now what if Glen
                      calls?

      She wraps the phone cord around the useless machine and puts it
      on her bed, then sneaks back to the door.  This time she gives an
      expression of relief, and opens the door.  MARGE is gone.

      Then the TELEPHONE RINGS again.

      CAMERA MOVES IN ON NANCY as she turns slowly.

162.  REVERSE IN HER POV.  THE TELEPHONE RINGS again, despite the fact   162.
      that the end of its janked-out cord is clearly visible.  The
      NIGHTMARE MUSIC THEME slips right up our spines.

      BACK ON NANCY.  She starts to shake.  She goes to the telephone
      as we WIDEN, unwraps it as it RINGS even louder.  She's shaking
      so hard by now she can barely manage to lift the receiver.  MOVE
      IN CLOSE ON HER, so close we can HEAR her teeth chattering as she
      brings the phone to her ear.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Hello?

      The unmistakeable VOICE of FRED KRUEGER comes over the phone,
      garbled by time and unknown dimensions, but clear enough.

                                      KRUEGER (FILTER)
                              (triumphant)
                      I'm your boyfriend now...

      CLOSE ON THE MOUTHPIECE.  It's changed from a normal telephone
      mouthpiece to an actual mouth -- Fred Krueger's mouth -- and his
      long, slick tongue flicks out and darts into the startled girl's
      mouth!

      WIDER -- as NANCY explodes from her micro-dream -- absolutely
      mad.  She jerks the telephone away from her and smashes it
      against her wall, then attacks it with her feet and hands,
      smashing it to smithereens.

      ANGLE ON THE TELEPHONE PIECES.  Normal pieces of a normal
      telephone.

      She pinches herself hard -- until tears come and her flesh is
      nearly bleeding.

                                      NANCY
                      I'm awake, I am awake.  This is
                      not a dream!  I am --

      She stops, realizing what Krueger meant.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      My boyfriend...!


163.  INT.  NANCY'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                 163.

      NANCY barrels down the stairs and across the darkened living room
      to the front door.

      It takes her a moment of tugging and fumbling to realize the
      deadbolt is locked from inside.  And there's no key in it now.

      She races to a porch window and throws it open, shaking and
      banging on the bars like a mad woman.  But there's no getting
      through.  She staggers back, stymied and furious.  Then somebody
      moves behind her in the dark.

                                      VOICE (OS)
                      Locked.

      NANCY jumps around in shock.  Her mother has posted herself on
      the couch with her bottle.

                                      NANCY
                              (furious)
                      Give me the key, mother.

                                      MARGE
                      I don't even have it on me,
                      so forget it.

      The word is final.  NANCY runs past the woman to the back door,
      to one window after the other, shaking bars and slamming locks
      and SCREAMING in teenage fury.  But it's no good.  The house is
      her prison.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                              (drunk satisfaction)
                      Paid the guy damn good to make
                      sure you stayed put.  You ain't
                      goin' nowhere, kid.  You're
                      gonna sleep tonight if it kills
                      me.

      NANCY clenches her fists and screams at the top of her lungs, a
      heart-wrenching, eardrum-breaking cry of love in despair --

                                      NANCY
                      GLEEENNNNNN!

                                                SMASH CUT TO:

164.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         164.

      CLOSE ON GLEN'S FROM DIRECTLY ABOVE.  The MUSIC is tinny from the
      earphones, the TV SOUND DISTANT AND ECHOED.  The boy is breathing
      deeply now, slowly and gently.  Then, unmistakeably, he begins to
      SNORE.  Very faintly, far in the background, we can hear NANCY.

                                      NANCY (OS)
                      Glen!!  Don't fall asleeeeeep!

      CAMERA PULLS BACK AND STRAIGHT UP as the SNORES merge with a
      weird, unsettling MUSIC CUE.  The boy lies sprawled, still
      clothed, in the middle of his bed.  Save for the bedside lamp,
      the room is dark.

      FULL WIDE ANGLE FROM THIS HIGH SPOT looking down at him as from
      the eyes of some great fly hung on the ceiling.  THE MUSIC
      REACHES A TERRIFYING PITCH OF ANTICIPATION -- THEN STOPS
      ABRUPTLY.

      There's a heartbeat's pause.  Then with tremendous force, two
      powerful arms shoot up beneath the red and yellow bedspread and
      grab GLEN around the waist!

      Next moment the young man's body is dragged straight down into
      the bed, as if some huge beast had grabbed him and heaved him
      down!  His feet and his arms shoot up -- there's another hauling
      yank -- and the boy disappears except for his hands and fingers
      -- down into the pit in the middle of the bed!  His hands are
      last to go, clawing for a hold.  But soon they vanish as well,
      dragging blankets and bedsheets, wires and stereo across the
      caved-in bed and into the abyss.

      There's HIDEOUS SCREECHING of MUSIC jamming in with GLEN's
      ECHOING SCREAMS -- then an unholy, sudden silence.

      Next moment what's left of GLEN is vomited up from the pit of the
      nightmare bed...a horrible mess of blood and bone and hair and
      wires...streaming out and over the bed.  Then the pit in the bed
      is gone as if it were never there.

      Drawn by the terribly screams and struggle, GLEN's mother bursts
      into the room.  The women stares for one moment of horrified
      disbelief, then reels back and lets out the most god-awful SCREAM
      imaginable.  The cry splits the night.


165.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          165.

      The SOUND of the SCREAM CROSS-FADES WITH the WAIL of the
      AMBULANCE as it screeches to a halt at the curb, followed by two
      BLACK AND WHITES and an UNMARKED CAR.  Uniformed POLICEMEN spill
      out FOREGROUND.

      LT THOMPSON and PARKER exit the unmarked car.  By habit or by
      premonition THOMPSON glances at the house that was his home.  His
      eye is caught by a movement; his daughter is at her upstairs
      window, white-haired, hollow-eyed, looking down on him through
      her bars.  She gives a little wave.

      Unnerved, THOMPSON waves back, then walks rapidly for GLEN's
      home.  MR LANTZ, pale as a ghost himself, waits on the porch; we
      can hear the mother's WAILING inside.


166.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        166.

      CLOSE ON NANCY'S BIG OLD WINDUP ALARM CLOCK.  Its big and little
      hands sweep together at midnight.

                                              BURN ON:

                              THE NINTH DAY

      There's a BABBLE of POLICE RADIOS, SIRENS WINDING DOWN, RUNNING
      FOOT-STEPS, SHOUTS, NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS and DOGS BARKING as CAMERA
      LIFTS TO NANCY'S FACE.  Set.  Unafraid.  Ruthless.

      The girl pulls the window shade on it all, then looks at her
      bed.

                                      NANCY
                      Okay, Krueger, you bastard.
                      We play in your court.


167.  INT.  GLEN'S LIVING ROOM/NANCY'S KITCHEN -- INTERCUT.  NIGHT.      167.

168.  LT THOMPSON is halfway across the living room when he stops.       168.
      Something dark and red is welling from a crack in the ceiling.
      One of his men is rigging a bucket beneah to catch the leaking.
      The telephone rings and PARKER picks it up.

                                      PARKER
                      Lieutenant.  It's your daughter.
                      Says it's urgent.

      THOMPSON turns away from the dripping.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                              (low)
                      Tell her I'm not here, tell
                      her...

                                      PARKER
                      Uh, she just saw you, sir...

      THOMPSON nods, crosses and picks up the telephone.  SCREEN
      SPLITS; we see both.

                                      LT THOMPSON (CONTD)
                      Hello Nancy.

                                      NANCY
                      Hi daddy.  I know what happened.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Then you know more than I do --
                      I haven't even been upstairs.

                                      NANCY
                              (guessing)
                      You know he's dead though, right?

      THOMPSON debates, then admits it.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Yeah, apparantly he's dead.
                      How the hell'd you know?

      A tear coarses down NANCY's cheek, but her voice remains firm.

                                      NANCY
                      I've got a proposition for
                      you.  Listen very carefully,
                      please.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Nan, I --

                                      NANCY
                      Please.  I'm gonna go get
                      the guy who did it and bring
                      him to you.  I just need you
                      be right there to arrest him.
                      Okay?

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Just tell me who did it and
                      I'll go get him, baby.

                                      NANCY
                      Fred Krueger did it, Daddy,
                      and only I can get him.  It's
                      my nightmare he comes to.

      The detective flinches at the name.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Where'd you hear about Krueger --

      NANCY presses, very firm, very rational.

                                      NANCY
                      -- I want you to come over here
                      and break the door down exactly
                      twenty minutes from now -- can 
                      you do that?

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Sure, but...

                                      NANCY
                      That'll be exactly half past 
                      midnight.  Time for me to fall
                      asleep and find him.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Sure, sure, honey.  You just 
                      do that -- get yourself some 
                      sleep -- that's what I've been
                      saying all along.

                                      NANCY
                      And you'll be here to catch
                      him, right?

                                      PARKER
                      Lieutenant -- they're waiting
                      upstairs.

      THOMPSON waves curtly, still speaking to NANCY.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Sure, okay, I'll be there.
                      Now you just turn in and get
                      some rest, sweetheart.  Please.
                      Deal?

                                      NANCY
                      Deal.

      NANCY hangs up.  LT THOMPSON starts upstairs.  But then he stops,
      and as an afterthought he could never really explain, turns to
      PARKER.

                                      LT THOMPSON (CONTD)
                      Get outside and watch her house.
                      If you see anything funny call
                      me.

                                      PARKER
                      'Anything funny' like what?

      THOMPSON shakes his head, embarassed.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      I don't know -- but one thing
                      for sure, I don't want her 
                      coming over here.  She's way 
                      too far gone to be able to
                      to handle this.

      As PARKER exits, ANGLE CUTS TO NANCY'S KITCHEN as the girl hangs
      up and sinks back agiainst the wall, trapped by her own
      resolution.  She looks at her watch.

169.  INSERT -- five past midnight.  NANCY switches modes to stopwatch   169.
      and sets the COUNTDOWN going at twenty-five minutes.


170.  INT.  GLEN'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                      170.

      LT THOMPSON steps into GLEN's room, anxious to be done with it.
      He hits a wall of stench and horror even before he takes it in
      with his eyes, and as soon as he sees the bed he claps his hand
      over his mouth, pivots and walks right back into the hallway.


171.  INT.  HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                                             171.

      He sags against the wall, unable to look at the COPS who hover
      there.

                                      COP
                              (faint)
                      What the hell did that,
                      Lieutenant?  There ain't even
                      a head left.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Goddamed if I know.
                              (tries to straighten)
                      What's the Coronor say?

                                      COP
                      He's in the john puking since 
                      he saw it.


172.  INT.  CELLAR.  NIGHT.                                              172.

      NANCY pulls tools and hardware out with grim resolution.  Hammer,
      nails, spools of wire, an old square of heavy fishneting, some
      old shot gun shells, a file -- referring only once to the booklet
      in her hand.


173.  INT.  NANCY'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                 173.

      Barely able to control her shaking hands, NANCY starts stringing
      off the spool of wire across the living room, crying and swearing
      at the same time.

      DISSOLVE TO HER HANDS wrapping bare lamp wire around two
      thumbtacks stuck into the insides of the pinchers of a common
      wooden clothespin.  The wire goes OFF SCREEN.

      ANOTHER ANGLE as she inserts a Lifesaver between the two prongs.
      One end of the fishline is tied to the lifesaver.  The whole now
      is stretched taut about three inches off the living room carpet.

      ON NANCY carefully filing a hole in a LIGHTBULB.

      OH HER pouring powder and shot from shotgun shells into the
      opening in the bulb until it's full, then sealing it with tape.

      DISSOLVE TO HER screwing the bulb back into the floor lamp, and
      placing the thing near the foot of the stairs.

175.  INT.  NANCY'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                            175.

      -- NANCY completes installing a sturdy sliding bolt to the
      outside of her own bedroom door.

      -- NANCY screws a hinge into the wall directly above her door.
      Attached to the hinge is the shank of something -- some kind of
      tool.  We can't see what it is because CAMERA never quite frames
      the whole thing.

      -- NANCY tiptoes to her mother's door and peeks in.

	
176.  INT.  MARGE'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     176.

      MARGE lies propped in her bed looking back at NANCY.  Her
      drunkeness has been altered by the SIRENS and BABBLE outside into
      a sort of comatose clarity.

                                      MARGE
                      Guess I should'n'a done it.

                                      NANCY
                      Just sleep now, Mom.

                                      MARGE
                      Just wanted to protect you,
                      Nan.  Just wanted to protect
                      you...

      MARGE slides over on her side.  NANCY smooths her hair, covers her
      as she would a child, then exits the room.

178.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        178.

      The girl enters, turns out her bedside light, slips out of her
      dress and puts on her nightgown.  Then she kneels by her bed.

                                      NANCY (quietly)
                      Now I lay me down to sleep,
                      I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
                      If I should die before I wake,
                      I pray the Lord my soul to take.

      She gets into bed and pulls the blankets to her chin.

      CLOSE ON NANCY's face.  She stares straight up at the ceiling for
      a long moment, then closes her eyes.

                                                 CUT TO:


179.  INT.  GLEN'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  179.

      LT THOMPSON trudges down the stais and confronts GLEN'S FATHER.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      I know it's hard to think at
                      a time like this, Walter, but
                      can you think of anyone who
                      could've done such a thing?

      The father stares away, his voice low and dull.

                                      MR LANTZ
                      He done it.

      THOMPSON looks at the man, baffled.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Who?  Who did that?

                                      MR LANTZ
                      Krueger.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Krueger?

      The father gives him the strangest look.

                                      MR LANTZ
                      Had to've done it.  No one
                      else was in there.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      How you know that?

                                      MR LANTZ
                      Cause I thought Glen was 
                      gonna sneak out to see your
                      lunatic daughter, that's why.
                      So I locked him in his room!
                              (getting control)
                      Sorry.  Anyways, the door was
                      still locked when we heard the
                      screams.

      He blinks.

                                      MR LANTZ (CONTD)
                      Maybe god's punishing us all...

                                      LT THOMPSON
                              (much lower and hard)
                      Keep your head -- this is a
                      fucking flesh and blood killer
                      we're talking about.

                                      MR LANTZ
                      Like Rod Lane?

      A voice calls down from upstairs.

                                      COP (OS)
                      Lieutenant Thompson.  Coronor
                      wants to show you something.

      THOMPSON gives MR LANTZ one final look, then heads upstairs.

                                              CUT TO:


      NOTE: These rewrites of scenes 180 and 180 A replace NANCY
      walking through the 'dream streets' at night, and NANCY
      approaching the huge deserted building at night, prior to her
      entering the Boiler Room the final time.


180.  INT.  DOWNSTAIRS, NANCY'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.                           180.

      LOW ANGLE UP STAIRS as NANCY appears at head.  As she comes
      downstairs, CAMERA MOVES WITH HER through the hallway to the
      cellar door.  She opens the door.


180A. INT.  NANCY'S CELLAR.  NIGHT.                                      180A.

      NANCY appears at top of these stairs, hesitates, then comes down.

      WIDER as NANCY approaches center of room, stops in CU, then turns
      eyes.  We HEAR the distant SOUND of the boiler room now, faint
      but unmistakeable.  NANCY MOVES, and CAMERA PANS HER to the
      cellar's side WALL, where another, new doorway is REVEALED.
      NANCY opens this door and looks down.  FIRELIGHT is on NANCY'S
      face now, and the SOUND of the Boiler Room is very clear.  NANCY
      goes through the door.


180B. INT.  BOILER ROOM.                                                 180B.

      NANCY decends like Orpheus into hell, but without weapon save her
      wits.

      She decends a steel stair to the lowest level, then hears the
      SOUND of the knives from down another shaft.  She sees there's an
      even deeper place down there.  She starts down.

      Again, and then again, NANCY decends, each ladder narrower or
      more twisting, each level deeper, wetter, darker, more airless.
      Soon she's gasping for air, but still she pushes herself on. She
      doesn't stop until she breaks out at last at the very bottom of
      the place, a wet, firelit sump deep in the bowels of the place.

      CAMERA NOW PANS AROUND WITH HER, and for the first time we SEE
      the vast maul of the empty boiler behind her.

      She stares at it.  It's seething with some dark WIND that soughs
      and whines like a huge dying dog.

      NANCY crosses to it, touching the pile of old, coal-dusted dirt
      at its base.  It looks almost like an old grave.

      She turns suddenly, listening.  Then, hearing nothing, she looks
      down.

      NANCY'S POV as she picks up GLEN's earphones.

      WIDER as she suddenly drops them, staring at her fingers.
      They're dripping blood.

      There's another BEEP.

180C. INSERT ON NANCY'S WATCH -- the COUNT-DOWN a blur of black digits   180C.
      counting down to zero.  They've just crossed the ten minute
      warning.

180D. CLOSE ON NANCY'S FACE.  She speaks into the night.                 180D.

                                      NANCY
                              (quietly)
                      Come out and show yourself,
                      you bastard.

      No sooner are these words off her lips than the huge bulk of FRED
      KRUEGER lurches up behind her!  The man is even more hideous
      hatless, his bald head and tormented face veiled in skeins of
      ruined flesh, his ragged teeth barred, the great spider of
      razor-blades flashing from his fingertips.

      He leaps, but the girl leaps just as fast, a fierce jump,
      that sends her out over black space and down into a huge, dark
      sump of blackness.


180E. EXT.  THE HEAVENS.  NIGHT.                                         180E.

      CLOSE ANGLE ON NANCY as she curves like a swan though her
      apogee, and begins falling, diving, planing through black air,
      the wind ripping at her hair and eyes.  Suddenly the complex,
      glittering skein of light that is the San Fernando Valley seen
      from the air slides INTO FRAME, and we see she's falling from
      high, high over the earth.

      NANCY falls, falls in slow motion against the spinning lights,
      free as a sky diver freefalling -- a giddy, acrophobic plunge.


181,182,183,184 OMIT                                    OMIT 181,182,183,184

185.  EXT.  ELM STREET/NANCY'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.                            185.

      NANCY crashes suddenly out of the night and into a hedge just
      outside her own front door, rolling out at its bottom scratched
      and bloodied.  If she were in any normal reality she'd be a mass
      of broken bones -- but somehow she's able to claw her way up and
      look at her watch once more.

      INSERT.  Just a few seconds from zero.

      She staggers for her house's front door -- but a moment later
      KRUEGER crashes down atop her!  NANCY struggles to her knees just
      as the man lunges with that godawful handful of blades.  But
      instead of running, she ducks inside the deadly grab and seizes
      him in a desperate bearhug!

      The surprise move sends him pitching backwards, her still on him
      --and they fall into the jumble of torn-down trellis of roses
      beneath her window.  Almost at that very second we HEAR the
      jarring, deafening RINGING of NANCY's alarm clock!

                                              SMASH CUT TO:


186.  INT.  NANCY'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     186.

      NANCY sprawls out of her bed onto the floor, twisting from the
      jabs of the already vanished thorns, briars and brush.  Gasping,
      she takes a second to get her bearings

      ANGLE ON THE BED as she recovers quick as she can, snatching up
      the net, ready for an assault from any direction.

      But the room is empty.

      Hardly able to catch her breath, her hair tangled, her nightgown
      torn, she drops the net.  She sits on the bed, turns on the
      bedside lamp and re-examines her room.  No one there but herself.

      It's a terrible blow, despite the fact that she's safe.  Her face
      is covered with tears, she's shaking and breathless.  She rattles
      her head in confusion and despair, realizing her own madness.

                                      NANCY
                      I'm crazy after all...

      At that very instant FRED KRUEGER leaps up from the far side of
      the bed with an EXPLOSIVE SHOUT of rage!

      He lunges across the table for her, missing by inches as NANCY
      pitches backwards and scrambles for the window.  But she's
      stopped by the bars.

      KRUEGER, incredibly fast, regains his feet and leaps again -- the
      girl wheels and shatters the coffeepot over his head.  As he
      crashes backwards NANCY flings open the door of her room and
      dives through -- only to rebound off someone on the other side --


187.  INT.  HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                                             187.

      MARGE, knocked flying by NANCY'S charge, hits the floor hard,
      knocking the wind out of herself.  NANCY sees what she's done,
      jumps over the body and slams the door and throws the new bolt
      home.  Next instant she gingerly ties a string to the door's
      knob, a string that trails down from the ceiling, attached to
      something up there that's still just barely out of sight.

      Next instant she's dragging her MOTHER towards the woman's
      bedroom as fast as she can.

      KRUEGER is already splintering the doorway behind her as NANCY
      dips and makes it into MARGE's room, SLAMMING the DOOR behind her
      and locking it in a flash.

      The MANIAC breaks the bolt and rips open the door.

      But the in the very act of doing this he of course unknowingly
      pulls the string attached to the outside doorknob with terrific
      force.

      CLOSE ANGLE ON THE CEILING.  The string jerks against a
      single-edged razor, which in turn cuts a tight wind of cord
      holding a heavy wedge of steel to the ceiling.

      WIDER as the thing falls free, pivoting at the hinge at the far
      end of its handle, and drives straight into KRUEGER'S groin with
      a terrific blow.  As he catapaults backwards with an incredulous
      shriek, the twenty pound sledge hammer swings back and reveals to
      camera just what it is!

      ANGLE DOWN ON KRUEGER, clawwing his way up despite his agony,
      lurching and cursing forward like an enraged bull.

      WIDER ANGLE IN THE HALLWAY as KRUEGER roars out -- only to
      immediately strike the length of WIRE strung across the hallway,
      catching it just above the thigh.  He cartwheels head-over-heels
      and lands flat on his back!

      Instantly the DOOR to NANCY's MOTHER's bedroom flies open and
      NANCY brings a brass lamp down over KRUEGER's head with all her
      might!  It sounds like a line-drive caroming off a metal
      flagpole.

      NANCY SLAMS the DOOR as KRUEGER struggles up, clutching his
      head.

      Enraged, the huge man CRASHES against the door with terrific
      force, and rears back and starts smashing against the door like
      the utter homicidal lunatic that he is.

                                                   CUT TO:


188.  EXT.  ELM STREET/NANCY'S HOME.  NIGHT.                             188.

      HIGH ANGLE at the second floor level.  NANCY jerks open the
      window to her MOTHER's bedroom and jams her face to the bars.
      The AMBULANCE is pulling away with a tremendous WAIL of its SIREN
      as NANCY SCREAMS down, trying to make herself heard.

                                      NANCY
                      Help!  Hey -- Daddy -- I got
                      him trapped!  Where are you!?

189.  ANGLE ON the street.  PARKER, assigned to guard the house, sees    189.
      NANCY -- hair white, eyes wide -- pounding on the bars and
      screaming like a lunatic.  But her meaning is utterly lost in the
      noise of the ambulance next to him.

                                      PARKER
                              (yelling up at her)
                      Everything's going to be all
                      right!  Everything's under
                      control!

      ANGLE at the window.  Close on NANCY's face, incredulous at his
      response.

                                      NANCY
                      Get my father, you asshole!

      PARKER does a little take.  That almost sounded sane.

                                      PARKER (OS)
                      You heard what I said!  Now get
                      back inside or I'll tell your
                      dad!

191.  Behind her the DOOR SPLINTERS.  NANCY whirls around just in time   191.
      to see KRUEGER bull in!  NANCY's eyes go wide -- she's trapped
      against the bars and has nowhere to go.  The man bunches his
      knives into a single thick blade and rushes her, stabbing.  NANCY
      closes her eyes --

      Then from OUT OF FRAME Marge leaps between the two.

                                      MARGE
                      No!

      She blocks the charge perfectly -- blocking the knives.
      Both she and NANCY are slammed backwards against the bars
      behind.
      Drunk though she is, is hanging onto KRUEGER'S weapon hand,
      keeping the knives inside herself, away from her daughter!

                                      MARGE
                      Nancy -- for god's sake's run!

      But NANCY turns to the window instead, screaming for her father.

                                      NANCY
                      Daddy!  Where are you!


192.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          192.

      PARKER, just about to turn back to the business at GLEN's house,
      sees NANCY and SOMEONE else fall just inside the window.
      Something begins to dawn on the man.  Just a little.

                                      PARKER
                      Poor woman's got her hands full 
                      with that kid.  Maybe I better 
                      tell the lieutenant.

      He turns and jogs towards GLEN's house.


193.  INT.  MARGE'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     193.

      ANGLE ON KRUEGER, hauling MARGE up in rage, knocking her
      senseless across her bed and climbing after her with his knives
      raised.  NANCY wheels behind him and whams him in the kidneys
      with her fists, spilling him back off the bed, then running past
      him for the door.  She makes it to safety,
      then turning back.  She flips the monster the bird, her eyes wild
      with pain and fury.

                                      NANCY
                      Hey fuckface -- can't catch me!

      The bait works -- KRUEGER leaves MARGE and howls after NANCY.


194.  INT.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                                    194.

      As NANCY clears the hall and makes the stairs, KRUEGER lurches
      through the shattered doorway after her.


195.  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         195.

      The girl careens down the stairs, across the room and to the
      front door, banging against it with terrified fury.

                                      NANCY
                              (screaming)
                      Come on -- he's in here!
                      Daddy!  Don't let him kill
                      me too!

      Behind her the huge MAN is thumping down the stairs, KNOCKING
      THINGS OVER, SCRAPING his LONG STEEL FINGERNAILS along the wall
      with a horrible sound!

      NANCY flings a heavy ash tray through the porch window and
      screams through the bars.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      HEELLLPPP!!!  Daddyyyyyyy!!!!

      KRUEGER, bloody and spewwing threats, staggers for her -- NANCY
      dives behind the couch.

      CLOSE ON KRUEGER'S FEET as they hit another wire.

      CLOSE ON the Lifesaver jerking out -- the clothespin snapping
      together, completing the circuit with a CRACKLING SPARK.

      WIDER ON THE EXPLOSION that rips out of the floor lamp next to
      KRUEGER and knocks him sprawling across the room.

      NANCY peeks out from behind the couch.  The man lies in a smoking
      heap.  NANCY runs to the windows and screams out again.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      Hey -- Daddy!  Hey!  I got the
                      bastard!

      KRUEGER roars up behind her -- she throws herself sideways -- he
      crashes into the window frame, smashing glass and wood to bits.

      NANCY turns SCREAMING and runs deeper into the house.


196.  OMIT                                                               196.

197.  INT.  CELLAR.  NIGHT.                                              197.

      She careens down the stairs, throwing on the lights, the man
      thundering after her.

      ANGLE AT THE FAR END OF THE CELLAR.  NANCY brakes at the wall.
      Nowhere left to hide.

      THE SCRAPPING of the blades against brick turns her to see the
      huge killer holding his knife-laden fingers up for her.

                                      KRUEGER
                      Ready for these?

198.  ON NANCY -- she ducks behind the furnace -- comes out the other    198.
      side with the big jug of gasoline and lets KRUEGER have it
      straight over the head.  The heavy container shatters, showering
      its contents over every square inch of the man.

      He staggers backwards with a ROAR of fury, NANCY screaming after
      him with a box of kitchen matches.  Before the man can realize
      what she's up to, she ignites the whole box and throws it in
      KRUEGER's face.

      There's a blinding WHOOSH -- and KRUEGER goes up in a terrific
      BALL OF FIRE.  Faster than a flash the girl runs past the howling
      maniac and makes for the stairs, KRUEGER after her in full
      pyrrhic rage.


199.  INT.  NANCY'S KITCHEN.  NIGHT.                                     199.

      NANCY holds the heavy door until the precisely right moment.
      Just as the burning, blind monster tops the stairs, NANCY brings
      the heavy oak door round with all her might and catches him in a
      great RINGING CONCUSSION.  It sends him windmilling backwards and
      down the stairs in an ass-over-teakettle sprawl of sparks and
      flames.

      NANCY slams the door and throws the deadbolt home.

      No sooner does she accomplish this than the man is SLAMMING again
      and again against the door from the cellar.
                           The terrible SCREAMS and CURSES PEAK,
      THEN GROW WEAKER AND MORE GARBLED.  Then there's just silence.

      NANCY staggers, half blind, from the kitchen.

      As the room begins seething SMOKE from every pore, we

                                              CUT TO:


200.  INT.  GLEN'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                             200.

      The CORONER steps out of the bathroom peeling bloody rubber
      gloves.  Pale and sweating.

                                      CORONER
                      Found you something, Donald.
                      Should remind you of something...

      The man shoves out his hand to LT THOMPSON.  THOMPSON stares at
      it without touching it.  A long, thin steel blade, razor sharp,
      attached to some sort of ring and armature -- broken off...

	The CORONER gives a sweaty, grim smile.

                                      CORONER (CONTD)
                      Only place I ever heard of such
                      a thing before was ten years
                      ago.  Remember that fucker
                      Fred Krueger?

      LT THOMPSON has just knocked PARKER sprawling in his race to the
      stairs.

                                      PARKER
                      Hey -- your daughter's acting 
                      kinda -- !
                              (THOMPSON'S gone)
                      Strange...


201.  EXT.  NANCY'S HOME.  NIGHT.                                        201.

      CRASH as NANCY breaks another window and presses against the
      bars.  The house shudders and glows orange behind her.  She sees
      her father bursting out the front door of Glen's house!

                                      NANCY
                      DAD!  GET US OUTTA HERE!

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!
                              (to his men)
                      Hey!  We got a fire!

202.  ANGLE ON NANCY'S FRONT DOOR.  Many MEN batter the door down as     202.
      black smoke pours from the windows and NANCY's SCREAMS and SHOUTS
      fill the air.  Within moments they've destroyed the door and LT
      THOMPSON has pulled his daughter into the safety of his arms.
      But NANCY immediately fights free and darts right back to the
      front door -- beckoning him to follow -- gesturing like a wild
      woman.

                                      NANCY 
                      I got him -- I got Fred Krueger!

      THOMPSON stares at his wild little girl in astonishment, then
      runs in after her.  The others follow, coughing and choking.


203.  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         203.

      THOMPSON collides with NANCY as she brakes, frozen.  THE SMOKE IS
      BELCHING OUT OF THE CELLAR, but whoever was locked in there
      certainly isn't now.  The door is flat on the kitchen floor.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      What the hell are you talking about,
                      Nancy?

      NANCY wheels without answering.  A series of tiny, isolated fires
      burn across the living room and up the stairs.  Firesteps.

                                      NANCY (CONTD)
                      He's after Mom!  Come on!

      She darts across the living room, following the flaming
      footprints of FRED KRUEGER up the stairs before THOMPSON can stop
      her.

                                      LT THOMPSON
                      NANCY!


204.  INT.  MARGE'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     204.

      NANCY STOPS IN THE SPLINTERED DOORWAY -- a ragged gold-red light
      splashing her horrified face.

205.  REVERSE IN HER POV -- FRED KRUEGER, literally a man of fire, has   205.
      a screaming MARGE pinned to the bed and is crawling all over
      her!  NANCY gives a banshee's howl, snatches up a chair and
      brings it down over the back of the firey beast, stunning him.

      By the time LT THOMPSON races into the room NANCY'S seized a
      heavy blanket has thrown over both of them, fighting the flames.
      The father joins his daughter without a second thought, heaving
      another blanket over the bed and smothering the last of the
      flames.

                                      NANCY
                      He's under there!  Watch it!

206.  THOMPSON pushes the girl back -- yanks out his .38 and pulls off   206.
      the first cover.  No movement.  He pulls back a second one,
      ready to fire.  But the only thing he sees is the blackened
      half-skeleton of his ex-wife, smoking and seething and sinking
      into the fluid-like mattress, sinking right down through it as if
      she were sinking into a lake.  A blackened, gnarled hand goes
      last, then the bed solidifies over the place she's disappeared.
      And it's as if no one was ever there.
 
      NANCY turns and looks at LT THOMPSON, her face white as her
      ghostly hair.  THOMPSON shoves his .38 back in its holster and
      finds a cigarette, his hands shaking so badly he can barely
      manage.

                                      NANCY
                      Now do you believe me?

      PARKER barges in.  The room is filled with smoke, the bed is
      stripped, but other than that, the place seems normal.

                                      PARKER
                      You find him?
                              (looking closer
                               at THOMPSON)
                      Sir?

      LT THOMPSON just walks by him.  PARKER chases after.

                                      PARKER (CONTD OS)
                              (fading)
                      Sir -- here, let me light that
                      for you -- Lieutenant?  What 
                      happened?
                              (gone)

      WIDER, ON NANCY alone in the room.  She turns and looks at the
      bed.  MUSIC slips in and builds.  The bed has changed color.
      It's now an ash-darkened red and yellow.

207.  CLOSER ON NANCY from the direction of the bed.  MUSIC SUDDENLY     207.
      STOPS, and the surface of the red and yellow bed gets a bump in
      its center that keeps raising, raising until it's a hump that's a
      head and shoulders, still raising until it looms over NANCY.

      Then FRED KRUEGER's entire shape sweeps up into the yellow and
      red mass -- and the garish head, smoking and seething, pops
      through.

      NEW ANGLE -- KRUEGER, a burned, sizzling black hump of a killer,
      clumps onto the floor between NANCY and the door.

      NANCY falls absoltely still, and her face goes through a
      strange, almost sublime transformation.

                                      NANCY
                              (quietly)
                      I know you're there, Krueger.

      She turns and faces him.

                                      FREDDIE
                      You think you was gonna get
                      away from me?

      NANCY shakes her head.

                                      NANCY
                      I know you too well now,
                      Freddie.

      KRUEGER smiles bitterly.  Coming closer.

                                      FREDDY
                      And now you die...

      There's a SLICKERING RATTLE at his side, and he raises the only
      thing on him not charred -- the gleaming steel talons.

208.  NANCY simply shakes her head again, as if seeing a light at the    208.
      end of her long, long tunnel.  And the way she says the words,
      they might be appearing on the inside of her eyes.

                                      NANCY
                      It's too late, Krueger.  I
                      know the secret now -- this
                      is just a dream, too -- you're
                      not alive -- the whole thing
                      is a dream -- so fuck off!
                      I want my mother and friends
                      again.

      KRUEGER grins insanely, confused and amused at the same time.

                                      FREDDIE
                      You what?

                                      NANCY
                              (even, firm)
                      I take back every bit of
                      energy I ever gave you.
                      You're nothing.  You're
                      shit.

      And then she turns her back on him.  KRUEGER bunches his
      fingers, producing a single ragged bundle of razor talons and
      raises his hand over the back of her head and neck.

      NANCY closes her eyes and steps to the door.

      CLOSE ON HER HAND, touching the door knob.

      CLOSE ON KRUEGER'S KNIFE-FINGERS poised.

      MUSIC BUILDS then SHRIEKS as KRUEGER stabs down, right through
      NANCY -- as if she were an optical illusion -- loosing his
      balance and falling down, down, down...  And he's gone.

                                              CUT TO:


209.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  DAY.                                            209.

      CLOSE ON NANCY'S FRONT DOOR AS NANCY jerks it open and blinks in
      the bright, diffused light.  The MUSIC FADES on a transitional
      note, into light.

      We hear BIRDS.

      CHILDREN playing.

      Early morning SOUNDS.

                                      NANCY
                              (to herself)
                      God, it's bright.

      MARGE sticks her head out, squinting, and nods.  Sober.

                                      MARGE
                      Gonna burn off soon or it
                      wouldn't be so bright.

      NANCY turns and looks her mother over.

                                      NANCY
                      Feeling better?

                                      MARGE
                      They say you've bottomed out
                      when you can't remember the
                      night before.
                              (shakes her head)
                      No more drinking, Baby, suddenly
                      I just don't feel like it
                      any more.

      She touches NANCY.

                                      MARGE (CONTD)
                      Didn't keep you up last night,
                      did I?  You look a little 
                      peeked.

      NANCY smiles.

                                      NANCY
                      Nah.  Just slept heavy.

      The girl gives a wave and goes off.  MARGE calls after.

                                      MARGE
                      See ya.

      NANCY turns and waves.

                                      NANCY
                      See ya.

210.  WIDER ON NANCY as she walks to the curb.  The whole scene is       210.
      wrapped in an unseasonal tule fog, bright yet diffuse.  We notice
      that NANCY's house no longer has bars on its windows.  Then we
      see a familiar convertible pull up at the curb, top down.  TINA
      and ROD are in the back seat.  They all wave to MARGE as NANCY
      climbs in.

                                      GLEN
                              (calling)
                      You believe this fog?

                                      MARGE
                              (laughs)
                      I believe anything's possible.

      TINA slaps five with NANCY.

                                      TINA
                      Lookin' good, girl!

      ANGLE INSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE.  GLEN slips into the seat next to
      NANCY.  Someone else is driving, it seems.  NANCY looks up to the
      DRIVER.  The big MAN turns and grins at NANCY, a terrible,
      scarred, hideous leer of a grin -- FRED KRUEGER'S grin!

      ANGLE BACK OUTSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE as its top clamps over the
      kids within -- a bright red and yellow top that closes as fast
      and hard as a beartrap!  NANCY'S frightened face flies to the
      window, pressing against the thick glass as the car roars away
      from the curb and into the thick fog.

211.  CAMERA PANS TO a group of LITTLE GIRLS, half-hidden by the fog,    211.
      jumping rope and singing gayly.

                                      GIRLS
                      One two --
                      Freddy's coming for you!
                      Three four --
                      Better lock your door!
                      Five six --
                      Get your Crucifix
                      Seven eight --
                      Gonna stay up late!
                      Nine ten --
                      Never sleep again!

      MUSIC CROSSFADES WITH THIS SONG, expanding the simple tune to
      symphonic, boundless dimensions as the little girls fade into
      thin air, and we

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

1

EXTREME CLOSE-UP - TELEVISION SCREEN
The National Anthem resounds over the precision maneuvers of
the Navys Blue Angels. When Old Glory fills the frame the
local announcer identifies the station, signifies the
megahertz and signs off for the morning. Transmission ends
and a BLAST of disturbing static rules the airwaves. It is
2:30am on a Sunday morning.
CAMERA SLOWLY WITHDRAWS
The TV set appears. A fireplace is off to the right, trophies
of outstanding achievement in annual home sales on the
mantel; STEVEN FREELING asleep in his convertible chair, an
open briefcase on his lap, real estate maps and lease
contracts spread out on the floor by his stocking feet.
CAMERA CONTINUES TO WITHDRAW until we are moving out of the
living room of this suburban two-story home and up the
stairs.

2

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
CAMERA MOVES along the hallway, past
to a partially open door. We explore
an instant, to catch DIANE FREELING,
sleep, a tangle of hair covering her

the guest bath and over
this room, if only for
32, tossing in her
face.

INT. DANAS BEDROOM - NIGHT

CAMERA moves away and slithers into another bedroom. DIANA
FREELING is sixteen, very beautiful, and snoring unevenly.
She is surrounded by potato chips and homework.

4

INT. CHILDRENS BEDROOM - NIGHT

The SOUND OF TELEVISION STATIC leaks as the CAMERA moves into
the last bedroom. ROBBIE FREELING is just a seven-year-old
lump under the covers. With the sheets tucked around him, he
looks like a ghost and where his head should be there is a
Dodgers baseball cap. The closet light is on and the closet
opened only a crack to let in the safe night light as we pass
beyond Robbie to CAROL ANNE FREELING. The STATIC SOUNDS from
the O.S. TV seem to arouse this pert six-years-old from a
sound and regular sleep. Her eyes snap open. She listens,
flicks some sleep from her eyes, and rises out of bed.

2.

CAMERA TRACKS AHEAD OF HER as if drawing her OUTSIDE the
safety of her bedroom and roommate brother.

5

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The STATIC crackles louder and a BLUE GLOW dawns across Carol
Anne. She could be sleepwalking. Her eyes are riveted and her
breathing quickens. The STATIC BOOMS now and Carol Anne stops
at the TV set in front of her sleeping dad. She stares into
the white snow, trying to see beyond the color dots. Carol
Anne opens her mouth until we are certain she is going to
SCREAM. Then
CAROL ANNE
Hello! Hell-ooo! What do you want!
Hello! Who are you! Hell-ooooo!
ANGLE - STEVEN FREELING
His eyes open.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Diane starts and sits up quickly.
CAROL ANNE (O.S.)
Who are you!! Hey!

7

INT. DANAS BEDROOM - NIGHT

She is already swinging her legs out of bed and moving into
the hallway.
CAROL ANNE (O.S.)
I cant hear you!!

INT. CHILDRENS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Robbie looks over to see Carol Annes bed empty.

INT. LIVING ROOM - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT
The entire family gathers and watches their youngest child
yelling through the static at 2:35 in the morning.
CAROL ANNE
What do you look like! Hello! Can I
see you?

EXT. CUESTA VERDE ESTATES OVERLOOK - DAY

10

Anyone outside of Manhattan is familiar with this setting.
Sunday in suburbia. A neighbor mows his lawn, another washes
his car, and a group of kids play soccer in the street. The
middle America World War II bought and paid for.

10-A

EXT. FREELING FRONT YARD

10-A

Then; an irregular glitch to this setting. A man, JEFF SHAW,
is running as furiously as his jelly-bowl paunch will allow.
In his arms, a large brown shopping bag. Barely avoiding a
collision with the paper boy, he cuts across the lawn,
jiggling the lettering. He crashes into the front door,
finding it locked. He turns and runs around back, just as
Steve opens the front door.

11

INT. FREELING KITCHEN - DAY

11

Shaw blasts past Dana, dressed in a terrycloth robe. She is
eating potato salad right out of the bowl in front of the
refrigerator.
DANA
Jesus H. Christ!

12

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

12

Shaw almost loses his footing turning into this room. His
breath exploding in wheezing puffs. He falls into a chair
next to Steve Freeling and FIVE OTHER MALE NEIGHBORS who tear
into the brown shopping bag, surfacing with Michelob Lites.
SHAW
Whatd I miss!?
STEVEN
Haden fumbled!
ARNIE
Sacked!!
SAM
Oaklands bringing out Bahr.
SHAW
Three more! Jesus! I was ahead on
points, now Im pushing.

4.

STEVEN
Shhhhhhhh!!

13

INT. CHILDRENS BEDROOM - DAY

13

Diane is straightening things in here when she notices
something that causes her to sadly catch her breath. She
walks forward to the bird cage slowly letting it out. Carol
Annes yellow canary is feet up on the bottom of the cage.
DIANE
Oh Tweety, couldnt you wait for a
school day?

14

EXT. FREELINGS BACK YARD - DAY

14

Robbie is next to a tall, misshapen oak tree that has grown
bent forward, a little too close to the house. Robbie is
marching in circles around the tree, acting brave. He starts
to climb.

15

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

15

The Sunday FOOTBALL CROWD is on its feet. Haden has the ball
again and the pass is a bomb.
STEVEN
Look at that fuckin Dennard run.
SHAW
Lester Hayes. Fuckin Hayes is
there!! Hes there! Hes...
The channel changes all by itself to Mister Rogers.
STEVEN
(yelling at the wall)
Tuthill--! You asshole!
ARNIE
Turn it back! Christ!
STEVEN
Sorry guys. When my neighbor uses
his remote... hes on my same
frequency.
Steve turns it back to football. A second later, Mr.
Rodgers is singing. Steve walks over to the wall, and points
his remote control and fires!

5.

From the other side of the wall comes a muffled ROAR.. The
voice of BEN TUTHILL.
TUTHILL (O.S.)
Dont start, Freeling!

16

EXT. SLIDING DOOR/FREELING HOUSE - DAY

16

Steve opens the sliding glass door and yells over the fence.
Tuthill, a robust man in a tank top and sunglasses, yells out
his window, the remote control brandished in Steves
direction.
STEVEN
We got a game going on over here!
TUTHILL
The kids wanna watch Mr. Rodgers!
STEVEN
I dont care what youre watching,
as long as you show a little mercy
with that thing!
TUTHILL
(closing his window hard)
Move your set!
STEVEN
Move yours!
Tuthill clicks at Steve through his window.

17

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

17

Steves channels change and the gathering SCREAMS again.

18

EXT. SLIDING DOOR - DAY

18

Steve fires his remote at the Tuthills and a muffled
goddammit! is heard.

19

INT. HALLWAY TO BATHROOM - DAY

19

Diane has Tweety by his little claw feet at arms length. With
a sour grimace she moves into the bathroom and raises the
toilet seat, aims Tweety and... Carol Anne steps into the
doorway catching her Mom red-handed.

6.

CAROL ANNE
Tweety--!!
DIANE
(barely audible)
Oh shit.

20

EXT. FREELINGS BACK YARD - DAY

20

With his own bedroom window facing him, Robbie climbs among
the twisted branches, then looks at the neighborhood and the
sky beyond.

20-A

EXT. - P.O.V. OF SKY - DAY

20-A

Storm clouds are gathering in the distance.

21

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

21

CLOSE SHOT - CIGAR BOX
Diane places little Tweety into the cigar box. She starts to
close the lid.
CAROL ANNE
Tweety doesnt like that smell.
DIANE
Sweetheart, Tweety cant smell a
thing.
CAROL ANNE
(giving orders)
Put a flower with him.
Diane smiles at this thought and takes a red rose from the
vase on the windowsill. Carol Anne pulls into her pocket and
takes out some red licorice. She bites off the end, spits it
out into her hand and places the wet piece inside the cigar
box.
CAROL ANNE
For when hes hungry.
She places a Polaroid snapshot of herself and Robbie.
CAROL ANNE
For when hes lonely.
She covers him with a napkin.

7.

CAROL ANNE
For when its nighttime.
Carol Anne starts to cry as she closes the lid. Diane looks
on. She really loves this kid.

22

EXT. FREELINGS BACK YARD - DAY

22

Diane has dug a hole in the dirt. Robbie and Dana watch as
Carol Anne places the cigar box into the earth. Dana is
eating celery and Diane throws her a youre chewing too
loud look. Robbie, from up in the tree, watches fascinated
as Diane and Carol Anne refill the hole. In the background
the football game is winding up with loud interludes between
the time-outs of the final quarter.
CAROL ANNE
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray
the Lord my soul to keep...
DANA
(rolls her eyes)
Brother...
DIANE
(to Dana)
Stifle it!
CAROL ANNE
If I should die before I wake...
DANA
(a defiant whisper)
It did.
CAROL ANNE
I pray the Lord my soul to take.
DIANE
That was lovely, honey.
ROBBIE
(staring at the freshly
dug earth, calls down
from the tree)
Mom, when it rots can we dig it up
and see the bones?
DIANE
Robbie!!

8.

CAROL ANNE
(brightening-- a new
topic)
Can I get a goldfish now?!

23

INT. CHILDRENS BEDROOM - NIGHT

23

CLOSE UP - GOLDFISH BOWL
Carol Anne stares wondrously as two brand new goldfish nibble
Hertz Mountain from the surface. Robbie sits on his bed in
his PJ's reading a Popeye comic. Distant THUNDER can be heard
as Robbie looks over at his window.
ROBBIES POV
A weak flash of lightning outlines the tree he was playing in
earlier. It is not merely the overactive imagination of a
nine-year-old that makes this tree scary to us. The twisted
branches that seem to suggest arms and the split trunk that
appears to suggest horns is all too real even at first
glance.
CLOSE - ROBBIE
He doesnt want to look. He doesnt want to scare himself.
But he does.

23-A

DIANE ENTERS O.S.

23-A

DIANE (O.S.)
Honey, youre overfeeding them.
CAROL ANNE
Tweety-two and Tweety-three wants
seconds.
ROBBIE
Mom, theres a big storm headed
this way.
DIANE
Youll be asleep by the time it
gets here... if you hurry. Lights
out!
The kids dive for the covers. Diane turns out the light. The
room is overwhelmed by darkness. Carol Anne speaks up first.

9.

CAROL ANNE
(rapidly)
Closet light! Closet light!
DIANE
My fault. My fault.
Diane turns on the light in their closet and cracks open the
door. Carol Anne relaxes and waves good-night to her fish.
Robbie looks over at the rocking chair by the bureau. Sitting
straight up is clown doll. It is almost the size of Robbie.
Its stare is devilish and its smile is just a little too
broad for comedy.
Robbie gets up and without looking at the doll, throws a
plaid shirt over its head. He climbs back into bed, outlined
by a blue flash from the window.

24

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

24

CLOSE ON DUTCH MASTER CIGAR BOX
Two hands lift it from the shadows and into the light. The
lid starts to open and just as we expect to see Tweety-one we
see the stash instead. Steve removes a lid of grass and
some zigzag papers and starts to roll a joint. On the TV is
an old MGM movie.
Diane is reading Carl Jungs MAN AND HIS SYMBOLS. Steve picks
up a brochure on pool equipment and diving boards.
DIANE
(taking a hit)
Sleepwalking. Sleepwalking.
Nocturnal Somnambulism. * Ill
betcha its genetic. Carol Anne all
last week and then last night. Me
when I was ten. I once walked four
blocks and fell asleep in the back
seat of this mans car. He went all
the way to work before discovering
me. God. I started screaming...
people ran over. The police came.
They took the guy downtown. My
father had me examined for bruises,
hickeys, I dont know. Oh shit,
Steven! If we dig the pool and
Carol Anne falls in before theres
any water... Steven... are you
listening?

10.

Steven takes the joint back from Diane and pulls it down
halfway in one breath -- holding the hit.
STEVEN
(he talks like Dennis
Hopper)
Ever go off a three meter board?
DIANE
Whats three meters?
STEVEN
About ten feet.
DIANE
Honey, why dont we just build the
pool closer to the house and let
the kids jump off the roof?
STEVEN
See, its like an air pocket. From
three meters youre free-falling.
You can maybe squeeze in a halfgainer, jackknife into a swan,
twist back, tuck, splash.
DIANE
Splat!!
STEVEN
Spashhh.
DIANE
Splurg.
STEVEN
Honey, we can afford it.
DIANE
We dont really need it.
STEVEN
Its great for business. We build
the first house. We install the
first pool. Look around us. By
summer
(in bass baritone)
the hills are alive with the smell
of chlorine.
DIANE
Yeah and, our pool will be alive
with a thousand guests.

11.

STEVEN
Im the wind and youre the
feather!
*** REST OF SCENE MISSING ***

25

INT. CHILDRENS BEDROOM - NIGHT

25

Steven flops Robbie onto his pillow just as a flash lights
the room and the tree outside the window. Carol Anne lies
awake, watching.
ROBBIE
I dont like the tree, Dad.
STEVEN
Its an old tree. It was here for a
long time. Long before my company
built this neighborhood.
ROBBIE
I dont like its arms. It knows I
live here, doesnt it?
STEVEN
(not aware this scares
Robbie)
It knows everything about us.
Thats why I built our home next to
it. So it could protect you and
Carol Anne, Dana, your mom and me.
Its a wise old tree.
ROBBIE
It looks at me. It knows I live
here.
Robbie is visibly frightened now and Steven realizes hes
scared him. Just then a tremor of thunder rolls through the
bedroom and Robbie snuggles up to his dad.
STEVEN
Storms gonna miss us.
ROBBIE
How do you know?
STEVEN
Because I can count.
Then more thunder. Robbie flinches, but tries to be brave.

12.

After you
until you
can count
means the
you.

STEVEN
see the lightning, count
hear the thunder. If you
higher each time, that
storm is moving away from

A flash of lightning is seen.
STEVEN
Now count with me.
ROBBIE/STEVEN/CAROL ANNE
One, two, three...
Thunder is HEARD.
STEVEN
Next time youll be able to count
to four or more. You try it, okay?
ROBBIE
Okay.
Steven exits leaving the door open. Lightning occurs. Steven
waits by the partially open door and listens as Robbie
counts.
ROBBIE
(very worried)
One... two... three... four...
five...
Distant thunder is HEARD. Robbie is more relieved.

26

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE DANAS BEDROOM - NIGHT

26

He feels real good about himself. He KNOCKS on Danas door.
Music is HEARD. The door opens.
STEVEN
Goodnight, Dana.
DANA
Uh, goodnight, Dad.

STEVEN
Get off the phone, Dana.

13.

DANA
(caught)
Okay, Dad.

INT. CHILDRENS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Robbie looks out the window. The tree stands there in the
wind. Another flash of lightning, Robbie controls his fear
and concentrates.
ROBBIE
One, two...
CRACK! BOOM! An explosive
The closet light goes out

upright. Carol Anne wakes

jolt of thunder rocks the house.
as the tree outside the window
if looking in. Robbie sits bolt
up SCREAMING.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MUCH LATER - NIGHT

28

Carol Anne and Robbie are asleep next to Diane and Steve. The
TV has been left on and the National Anthem starts to play...
CLOSE - FAMILY
Various positions, asleep.

28-A

SLOWLY MOVE IN CLOSER TO THE TELEVISION

28-A

The pre-recorded voice of the station manager signs off. A
beat... Transmission ceases and the soft roar of dead air
fills the room as the static white snow colors the walls,
making shadows flicker and warp.
It is only now that we first hear it. A SOUND intermingling
with the TV hiss, like a bad connection from far, far away. A
whisper. Not one, but hundreds of them. They say nothing.
Its a chorus, tonal and inviting.

28-B

CLOSE - CAROL ANNE

28-B

She turns on her side. And her eyes open surreally. Ever so
slowly, she turns her head fully facing the TV. Carol Anne
smiles. A smile much too sophisticated for a five-years-old
child.

14.

28-C

CLOSE - TV SCREEN

28-C

The snow mixes with new imagery. Forms. Vague but luminous.
Always mingling. Impressionistic. Never hard-lined.
CAROL ANNE
(whispering)
Come out... come out...
The picture tube starts to SNAP! Little flashes momentarily
blind Carol Anne. She blinks and tries to see deeper. SNAP!
CRACK! Its as if flashbulbs were being emitted. Steven and
Diane turn fitfully but remain asleep. FLASH! POP! Robbie is
close to waking.

28-D

CLOSE - CAROL ANNE

28-D

Smiling, on her knees now... she reaches out toward the TV
screen when... SOMETHING REACHES BACK. A Substance. A form,
like a wispy, smoky tentacle twists forward, EXTENDING FROM
THE PICTURE TUBE and snaking into the Freeling bedroom.
Transparent and cold, it gives birth to itself, builds upon
its own energy, growing brighter as it seems to hover above
Carol Anne, then tower over the family asleep in the kingsized bed.

28-E

CLOSE - CAROL ANNE

28-E

She must bend her neck to look all the way up at the ceiling
where this cyclonic shape waltzes... studying.. at the room,
then Carol Anne...
AN EXPLOSION from the TV set. The brightest flash yet
experienced. A force that expels the intruder from the set
and into the room. Catapulting it past the family and into
the wall RIGHT OVER THE BED, where it leaves a dark pencil
dot stain. The entire room shakes and the family is awake and
panicked.
The window cracks, the curtain rod slips. Books and mementos
fall from the open hutch. The medicine cabinet opens and
prescription medicine splatters on the tiled floor. The room
lights flare then die. Every picture topples from the walls.

28-F

Just as quickly as it began, the episode ceases. A HUSH 28-F
descends. Everyone looks at Carol Anne. Carol Anne looks at
everyone... then intones, almost matter-of-factly.
CAROL ANNE
Theyre here.

Lurch forward, dripping sod and wet grass.
The shovel of the bulldozer touches the earth and scrapes a

CAMERA MOVES CLOSER as the cigar box coffin is cruelly
exhumed in the ever-growing tidal wave of back yard turf.

30

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

30

Steve is on the phone, nervously smoking a cigarette as the
bulldozer can be seen out the window, digging the new pool.
Diane is serving waffles around the breakfast table. E. Buzz
sits at Robbies feet, watching the waffles hopefully. Only
Carol Anne seems to have an appetite.
STEVEN
(on the phone)
Im not kidding, Jeff. How could
anyone sleep through a six-pointfive. Yes, damage. Stuffs in
pieces all over our bedroom.
DIANE
(quietly to Carol Anne)
Chew each bite ten times.
Carol Anne exaggerates her chewing; smiling with her mouth
full.
STEVEN
I know that... weve had the radio
on and theres nothing about it.
(after a beat)
After the Sylmar quake it was two
years before real estate was on the
rise.

16.

Diane is gently coaxing some information out of Carol Anne
who mostly has her mouth full of waffles and blueberries.
DIANE
When you said, Theyre here last
night.
CAROL ANNE
Can I take my goldfish to school?
DANA
Maybe the fault line runs just
under our house. Wouldnt that be a
scream?
ROBBIE
The ceiling got crumbs all over my
bed.
DIANE
(to Carol Anne)
Sweetheart. Do you remember last
night? Do you remember when you
woke up and said, Theyre here?
CAROL ANNE
Uh huh.
DIANE
Who did you mean? Whos here?
CAROL ANNE
(mouth full)
The TV people.
ROBBIE
Shes stoned.
DANA
What do you know about it?
ROBBIE
Moren you. Ask Dad.
Robbie picks up his milk to take a sip when the bottom of the
glass drops out, the milk splashing back onto Robbies cereal
bowl, overflowing cereal all over the table and onto Danas
blouse in a burst, perhaps slightly strong for the small
amount of spilled milk.
DANA
Hey--!

17.

ROBBIE
(throwing up his hands)
Its not my mess.
DANA
(jumps up from the table)
Thanks a lot, jerko - Ive got
class in twenty minutes.
ROBBIE
Mom.
DIANE
Gimme that thing before you cut
yourself.
Carol Anne has a big dripping splash of milk running down her
forehead. Oblivious to this she just keeps eating, goes over
to the kitchen TV... turns it on to the Today Show, then
switches to an in between channel and watches the snow.
STEVEN
Im outta here! See ya early.
ROBBIE
(imitating Dad)
Im outta here!
DIANE
(pushing him back)
You I can handle.
ROBBIE
I got school!!
DIANE
Breakfast first.
ROBBIE
(casually)
All right, Ill just flunk.
Robbie shrugs, reaches for his spoon to resume eating and
notices something unusual. The spoon is bent. He looks around
the table. Every spoon is bent. Shrugging it off, Robbie
lifts his cereal bowl and drinks right out of it, two tiny
trails dripping off his chin, spotting his school shirt.

EXT. FREELINGS BACK YARD - DAY

31

A big man, PUGSLEY, thirties, bald, steps out of his pool
install action truck wearing combat boots, a Teamster Tshirt, mirrored sunglasses and a baseball cap turned around
backwards on his head. He motions to the bulldozer driver to
take a gander. Dana grabs her bike and rides off. The
workmen pause to stare at her. Pugsley and the dozer driver
share a salacious grin and the dozer driver pops his clutch
rapidly, the dozer lurching suggestively several times.

32

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

32

Diane has witnessed this sloppy display through the open back
door. Choosing to pass over it, she turns toward the kitchen
table to clean up. E. BUZZ, the dog, is sitting on a pulledout chair eating from everyones plates. Diane sighs and
shoos E. Buzz away.
DIANE
When you leave the table, Carol
Anne... Robbie, you push your
chairs in.
Carol Anne is trying to fine-tune the snow on television.
DIANE
Aw, honey youre going to ruin your
eyes. This is not good for you.
She turns the set to another channel where a WAR MOVIE is
showing. Soldiers blowing up and screaming.

33

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

33

Diane is cleaning up. Broken glass surrounds her. She cups
her left hand and picks narrow shards out of the shag when
the GROWLING begins. Diane turns and sees...
DIANES POV
E. BUZZ is growling at the wall. Looking up at something we
dont see. Diane sidesteps the broken vases to follow E.
Buzzs eyeline right up the wall and onto the stain.
CLOSE - DIANE
She cocks her head curiously.
MOVE IN - THE STAIN

19.

It has grown since this morning. Like a Rorschach pattern.
Diane tries to rub it out with a pillowcase. She slips into
the bathroom and wets one corner, then returns when...
Diane stops. Carefully, she watches E. Buzz, who has ceased
growling.
FULL SHOT - DIANE AND E. BUZZ
Never removing his spaniel eyes from the wall, E. Buzz tail
starts wagging. He backs a scoot away from the wall and
executes and obedient roll-over. Diane herself retreats.
DIANE
(gently)
Cmere, E. Buzz.
E. Buzz turns, but his mind is not on Diane. He runs out of
the room between Dianes legs immediately returning with his
chew-ball. E. Buzz sidles up to the wall and sets his chewball down, speaks and executes a double roll-over.

34

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Diane enters, sees Pugsley drinking a cup of coffee from one
of her China cups.
DIANE

Okay, Bluto! Gimme my cup.
PUGSLEY
Gee, Mrs. Freeling you make great
coffee. Good for a second cup.
Pugsley breaks out laughing. Diane grabs the cup out of his
hands and drops the blinds in his face.

ANGLE - KITCHEN TABLE

34-A

Diane turns to find all the chairs are withdrawn from their
intended places. She looks for Carol Anne then jumps halfway
out of her skin.
Carol Anne is right behind her, tapping her on the side.
DIANE
Jesus, dont do that. You wanna see
your mommy lying in a cigar box
covered in licorice?

20.

Carol Anne shakes her head... slowly.
DIANE
(pointing to chairs)
Did you do that?
Carol Anne shakes her head slowly.
Diane replaces the chairs in their proper places and returns
to the sink. She opens the cupboard under the sink, and
brings out a bottle of 409. She stands and turns around...

34-B

FACING HER IS THE KITCHEN TABLE

34-B

The chairs are stacked one atop the other, reaching all the
way up to the ceiling. Diane jams her fist into her mouth to
press back the natural reaction. Carol Anne stands below her
smiling up at the pyramid.
DIANE
(a whisper to Carol Anne)
The TV people?
CAROL ANNE
Up there.
DIANE
(barely audible)
Do you see them?
CAROL ANNE
No... do you?
DIANE
Uh uh.

INT. KITCHEN/NEW, VACANT HOME - DAY

WIDE ANGLE - IDENTICAL KITCHEN
In a disconcerting jump, all of the furniture, Carol Anne and
Diane disappear. The basic structure of the kitchen remains
exactly the same for this is a model home somewhere in Cuesta
Verde Estates.
Steve Freeling walks into the empty setting with a family of
prospective buyers. Only the wallpaper is different from the
Freeling residence.

21.

STEVEN
This, then, is our latest
development. We call it phase four.
WOMAN BUYER
Where is your home, Mr. Freeling?
STEVEN
We were the first family to set up
housekeeping in Cuesta Verde
Estates.
HUSBAND
(helping)
Phase one!
STEVEN
Thats right. Actually you passed
through my neighborhood to get
here.
WOMAN BUYER
The area with that lived in look.
STEVEN
In a month you wont be able to
distinguish phase four from phase
one from phase... well, around here
grass grows greener on every side.
HUSBAND
Yeah... I cant tell one house from
the other.
STEVEN
Our construction standards are very
liberal. Matter of fact, a neighbor
of mine put a jacuzzi in his
bedroom, with a running aqueduct
connecting it to the wading pool
outside which he built half in,
half out of his living room. That
home was featured in last months
issue of Town and Country.

Sparse lightning over the mountains as the storm clouds begin
to roll in. The neighborhood is quiet. Warm window light
spill is out across the well manicured lawns. You can almost
smell two hundred dinners in all of the ovens of Cuesta
Verde.

EXT. STREET/FREELINGS HOUSE - DUSK

Steve Freelings Oldsmobile station wagon turns down the
block heading home.
ANGLE - FREEWAY DRIVEWAY
Three empty trashcans block the drive... Steve groans as he
parks half on, half off the curb, climbs out, and starts
removing obstacles when from nowhere Diane is there,
literally pulling toward the house.
STEVEN
Hey babe. Guess who just bought L-J
237...
DIANE
Just cmere! Hurry!
STEVEN
Wait a sec., Im parked in the
street.
DIANE
Leave it. Quick, before it stops
again.

38

INT. KITCHEN - DUSK

38

We have never seen Diane focused and again so frazzled. Her
words are coming in spurts. She must constantly catch her
breath. The thrill in her voice is backed up against an
oppressive fear.
DIANE
Okay, okay... look. Okay. Listen.
Ive kept Dana and Robbie out of
this, but Carol Anne was with me
when it started so I cut her in,
but Dana would blab and Robbied be
up for three weeks sleeping on your
side of the bed.

23.

STEVEN
Diane, put the breaks on will ya.
Just sit down a sec.
DIANE
No, goddammit, you sit down! I
mean... stand right there. And
just... just have an open mind.
Reach back into our past when I
used to know you with one and use
it for the next coupla minutes.
Carol Anne suddenly appears from around the corner looking
exhausted and cranky. In her hand is a San Diego Charger
football helmet.
CAROL ANNE
Mommy didnt cook any dinner.
DIANE
(loud)
Well go to Pizza Hut, all right?
ANGLE - STEVE
Looking around he sees chalk marks all over the kitchen
floor. Arrows and squares and numbers in two colors.
Dianes breathing quickens as she steadies herself. Skipping
to the kitchen table she takes one of the colonial country
chairs from the breakfast table and scrapes it along the
floor to the center of the room where four circles have been
described in chalk. Diane places each leg in one of the
proscribed circles and looks up at Steve.
DIANE
(last words)
Okay... okay now, watch!! Watch!!
She removes her hands from the back of the chair and steps
aside. Steve watches Diane as much as the chair. He starts to
step forward when Diane throws both of her hands out to stop
him.
DIANE
Look!
The chair begins to tremble. It virtually jitterbugs in
place... then begins to move forward picking up speed until
it traverses the entire length of the kitchen ending up right
in front of Steves bullfrog eyes.
ANGLE - CAROL ANNE

24.

Yawning.
CLOSE - DIANE
With hysterical victory in her eyes.
CLOSE - STEVE
Looking for wires. He kneels and feels the chair legs, then
immediately looks to Diane for the answer.
DIANE
Its okay. Its okay. Look!
(to Carol Anne)
Sweetheart, show Daddy.
CAROL ANNE
(angry now)
Im hungry.
DIANE
Dont argue!!
Carol Anne shrugs and puts on the football helmet. Diane runs
over to Steves side and pushes the chair out of the way.
Carol Anne sits on the floor in a circle with her name on it
in yellow chalk.
ANGLE - STEVE
Starts to run for her protectively. Diane restrains him.
LOW ANGLE - CAROL ANNE
She starts to tremble as if on a funhouse ride. Her little
body begins to move forward, faster, and all the way across
the kitchen floor right into Dianes arms.
CAROL ANNE
(rubbing her fanny)
That burned!
DIANE
Sorry, baby, floor needed more wax.
STEVEN
What the fuck!!
DIANE
You try!
STEVEN
What???

25.

DIANE
You cant believe the feeling.
STEVEN
Whats the gag? There a magnet back
there?
He looks behind the door in the dining room. Nothing. Steve
just stands for a long moment in hapless silence, then...
STEVEN
I hate Pizza Hut! Wheres supper? I
dont understand, Diane. What the
hells going on around here?
Steve sidesteps the chalk marks, removing himself from the
active area.
I figured
you. So I
dont ask
me figure

DIANE
Id never explain it to
showed you instead, but
me how or what. Just help
out what to do.

STEVEN
You mean theres no gimmick?
DIANE
Not from inside the house. Maybe
Tuthill got himself a super remote
from the Radio Shack.
Carol Anne adjusts her helmet and sits inside her launch
circle. Diane and Steve are having the discussion across the
room and arent aware of her.
STEVEN
Maybe the shake-up and this
thing... relate.
DIANE
No shit.
CAROL ANNE
Daddy, look at me!!
They turn but its too late. Carol Anne shoots across the
room faster than before, and with no one to catch her.
ANGLE - KITCHEN WALL
At a sickening speed her helmet smashes into the wall. Diane
SCREAMS. Steve runs over.

26.
An eight-inch hole in the wall and the cracked plastic on the
helmet testify to the force of impact. Carol Anne is dazed
but unhurt.
CAROL ANNE
You promised pizza.

EXT. BEN TUTHILLS FRONT PORCH - LIGHT

42

The front door opens and Tuthill steps into the bug light. An
obvious strain in this conversation.
The motives various, the feelings mutual. About a thousand
mosquitos chow down on the Freelings while they talk.
STEVEN
Hi, Ben.
DIANE
Mr. Tuthill.
TUTHILL
TVs off in here. If your sets
acting up again...
STEVEN
(laughing nervously)
No, no, uh-uh. Nothing like that.
We were wondering... although this
is going to sound strange coming
from me.
TUTHILL
I doubt it.
STEVEN
(swatting the mosquitos)
These mosquitos... Jesus.
TUTHILL
(so nonchalantly)
They never bothered me. I never
been bitten by one.

27.

TUTHILL(cont'd)
Far as I know, no member of my
familys effected by em.
(grabs his fourteen-yearsold kid)
Mosquito ever suck on you, son?
KID
Heck, I dont know, Dad.
Meanwhile Diane and Steve are being massacred.
TUTHILL
He dont know.
Suddenly, there is a crash from somewhere inside the Tuthill
home. Tuthill glances causally over his shoulder, turns back
to Diane and removes a wet piece of cigar tobacco from the
tip of his tongue.
DIANE
Mr. Tuthill, what my husband was
wondering...
STEVEN
(breaking in)
Yes. You see, Ben, something funny
in our house... next door.
Something...
DIANE
You been having any disturbances
lately?
TUTHILL
(suspiciously)
What sort of disturbances?
DIANE
(trying to be casual)
Oh, dishes or furniture moving -around by themselves?

Diane is applying calamine lotion to Steves neck and wrists.
DIANE
I had to say something. I was
losing a pint of blood every few
seconds.

28.

STEVEN
I think we should keep this thing
in the family. In the morning Ill
call someone in.
DIANE
Who for instance? Ive already
looked in the yellow pages.
Furniture movers we got. Strange
Phenomenon... theres no listing.
STEVEN
Okay. I have a plan. I have a plan.
Somethings occurring here that we
cant explain. If Carol Anne wasnt
wearing that helmet...
DIANE
Okay, stop it.
STEVEN
What if she wasnt? Jesus, Diane.
Wed be at County Emergency and not
getting ready for bed.
DIANE
Okay already!
STEVEN
Right. Okay. Lets wake the kids.
No big deal! Lets wake them, spend
tonight at the Travel Lodge in
Broxton. And come back tomorrow
with experts! Experts who can tell
us what it is thats happening and
if its safe to go home.
DIANE
Now youre scaring me. Dont try

INT. CHILDRENS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Robbie is wide awake. He is staring out the window from under
the covers. There is a flash of lightning. Robbie begins
nervously counting.
ROBBIE
One... two... three... four...
five...

29.

The SOUND of rolling thunder. Robbie tenses and watches the
tree.
ANGLE - WINDOW
A wind rustles the gnarled branches. The sky is a rolling
mass of gray and black.
A second flash of lightning and Robbie whispers to himself.
ROBBIE
One... two... three...
CRACKLE! RUMBLE! The window pane vibrates as the shock wave
from the thunder bears down and the wind begins to dance with
the tree.
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
DIANE
(getting her back up)
Im the one who lived with this
freaky thing all day. And nothing
bad happened. Its like another
side of nature. A side you and I
are not qualified to comprehend.
When you overreact like this it
makes what happened much too
important.
STEVEN
Nobody goes into the kitchen until
we know whats happening.
DIANE
(looking through the stash
box)
Were out of papers.

INT. CHILDRENS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Robbie is watching the tree. Carol Anne is asleep but shes
tossing and moaning like the wind outside the window.
Another FLASH OF LIGHTNING. Robbie pulls the covers up over
his nose and mouth. His little breath pushing the fabric up
and down as he counts.
ROBBIE
One... two...

30.

KA-BOOM! The room vibrates and Robbie takes his eyes off the
window for just a moment, looking at the open bedroom door
and the light down the hall from his parents room. He could
be out of bed and there in six seconds if he hurried.
A SAVAGE CRACK OF LIGHTNING. THE EXPLOSION OF THUNDER RIGHT
ON TOP OF IT.
Robbie snaps a look at the window just in time to see it
happen.

46-A

ROBBIES POV

46-A

A hurricane BLAST of wind hits the monster oak. The two
branches resembling arms fold forward aiming at the window.
The disfigured crown with the horns and knotty eyes bends
back before tipping forward.
The finger-twigs at the end of the arms reach out hungrily.

46-B

ANGLE - THE WINDOW

46-B

THE ENTIRE TREE CRASHES THROUGH ROBBIES WINDOW.
A FURNACE OF LIGHTNING accents the assault. Robbie starts
SCREAMING. The finger-twigs wrap around him like skeleton
hands and lift him right out of bed.
Carol Anne sits up and SCREAMS for Diane.
The tree seems to be exhaling. Its breath enveloping Robbie
in a phantom haze. The arms begin to retract pulling Robbie
toward the mouth and eyes.

46-C

ANGLE - ON THE DOOR

46-C

Just then, Steve and Diane appear in the doorway. Diane
SCREAMS as...
The tree pulls Robbie right out the window and into an eightymile-per-hour night. The ROAR of wind is almost unbearable...
drowning Robbies SCREAMS and those of his parents and Dana
who suddenly appears in the doorway.

46-D

INT. DOWNSTAIRS

46-D

Carol Anne is suddenly forgotten as Dana, Diane and Steve
hurl themselves downstairs and through the kitchen, only to
find the door blocked by several large branches.

31.
They scramble back through the kitchen, out the sliding glass
door and into the raging storm.

46-E

INT. CHILDRENS BEDROOM - ANGLE - CAROL ANNE

46-E

The force from the shattered window shoves Carol Anne against
the headboard of her bed where she hugs her clown doll with
all her might, its broad smile suddenly disconcerting as it
appears to be looking toward the closet in her room.

46-F

ANGLE - THE CLOSET

46-F

The closet door opens revealing the most feared and dreaded
space in this five-year-olds tiny, tiny world. Carol Anne
looks where her doll is looking and SCREAMS horribly.

47

EXT. BACK OF HOUSE - SECOND STORY WINDOW - NIGHT

47

The storm lashes the tree. The tree lashes Robbie. RAIN and
WIND and CONDENSATION make it difficult to see everything.
Sixty branches form a briar prison that starts to tear and
strangle. Steve races outside. A WALL of WIND makes his run
SLOW MOTION.

48

INT. CHILDRENS BEDROOM

48

ANGLE - THE CLOSET
The light inside grows to a supernatural intensity and a
SOUND unlike anything anyone would ever want to hear blasts
through the velocity of the storm. It is the closet sucking
the bedroom into its murderous glare. Anything not tied down
is swallowed. Carol Anne grabs her covers, and SCREAMS. NO
SOUND comes out.
She is lifted completely off the bed by the suction. Only her
death-grip on the sheets keeps her away. Unbelievably, her
clown doll is not affected by the vacuum pull. It just sits
on the floor where Carol Anne dropped it and stares up at
her, smiling.

49

EXT. SECOND STORY WINDOW - NIGHT

ANGLE - TREE
Steve reaches the twisting trunk and starts to climb. Dianes
SCREAMING from the patio is lost in the storm.

Steve reaches Robbie and the fight is defined only by the
flare of stroboscopic lightning. Every time it appears as
though Robbie will be freed, branches envelop him and wind
him tighter.

CLOSE - CAROL ANNES TINY HANDS
The sheets start to peel back. The closet swallows toys and
posters of Darth Vader and R2D2, then sucks harder, the NOISE
something like a colossal straw pulling at the last drop from
a deep, deep well. Only now does the bed give way, flipping
into the air and flying across the room, slamming Carol Anne
inside and blocking the opening with its frame and springs.
EXT. SECOND STORY WINDOW - NIGHT
ANGLE - TREE
Steve tears at the branches, trying to free Robbie. A crimson
fluid pumps thick from the branches that Steve destroys. As
suddenly as it began, the final burst of wind passes the tree
like the caboose at the end of a runaway train. He frees his
son and they topple out of the tree. Robbie throws his arms
around his Dad and the two hold on for their lives, gasping,
hugging, choking on the rain and sap. The tree is uprooted
before them and disappears into the storm.

With the exception of the two beds blocking the closet,
Robbie and Carol Annes room is stripped clean. Diane lets
out a muffled shriek and throws herself against the
barricade, pulling back mattresses, boxsprings and blankets.
Steve joins her and together they work side by side, panting,
crying and calling for Carol Anne.
ANGLE - ROBBIE
Still in a state of complete dislocation, Robbie walks back
into his bedroom and looks at the window. The tree is there
no longer. E. Buzz, the dog, joins Robbie, whimpering at his
feet.
ANGLE - THE CLOSET

34.

Over Diane, SCREAMING out Carol Annes name, Steve does the
muscle work, pulling off end tables, Lone Ranger lamps, chest
of drawers, toys and stuffed animals, working his way to the
bottom of this innocent debris.
CAMERA STARTS TO MOVE IN. Going beyond Steve to his hands at
work as he lifts the last layer of mayhem off Carol Annes
favorite pink blanket.
There is a folded lump beneath it. The lump doesnt stir.
Diane covers her mouth and hyperventilates as Steve gently
removes the fuzzy blanket and...
IT IS THE CLOWN DOLL, SMILING UP AT THEM OUTRAGEOUSLY.
STEVEN
Shes not here!
DIANE
(turning and calling)
Carol Anne!
Dana goes to the shattered window and calls out.
DANA

STEVEN
Dont go in there! Ill check it.

Oh my God. The swimming pool!
Everyone breaks running. Again passing Robbie in the hall.
Robbie turns into his mothers room. The SOUND OF TV STATIC
and blue video glow growing stronger with every step.

EXT. BACK YARD POOL EXCAVATION - NIGHT

Dana, Steve and Diane race to the edge. The rain has softened
the edges and Danas feet slide out from under her. She
starts to fall when Diane grabs her wrist, Dana simply
dangles above the deep end, filled with two feet of rainwater
and mud. Steve slides down the steep muddy shoot from three
to nine feet and plunges his hands into the quagmire.
He finds nothing.

The TV HISS is growing steadily and Robbie starts to register
something. From the back of his eyes, awareness regains
awareness that shifts to terror. Robbie opens his little
mouth and produces a low MOAN that slides relentlessly to the
upper registers of primal release.
ROBBIE

The STATIC HISS is almost unbearable. Through it all we can

Diane frantically searches the room.

Diane puts Robbie down and runs in a wide circle looking. The

Three banks of cold fluorescent purr down from the ceiling.
CAMERA PANS DOWN, past rows of metal bookshelves from which
reams of notes, files and textbooks hang in no organized
manner. Finally, the view STOPS on DR. MARTHA LESH, Professor
of Psychology at the University of California at Irvine.
Wearing a purple afghan to hide the urge for jelly beans and
souffles, Norm looks up from her questionnaire and takes off
her reading glasses. She is sixty-one and full of pep. Next
to her are two long-haired graduate students, TAK and RYAN.
DR. LESH
Who are the members of the
household involved? What are their
ages?

38.

STEVEN (O.S.)
(monotone)
Diane, my wife, shes 31. Uh.. 32.
My oldest daughter, Dana, 15.
Robert, my son, hes 9. And Carol
Anne...
(trails off)
DR. LESH
Yes... Carol Anne...
Dr. Lesh writes five years old on the form.
DR. LESH
Has there been any publicity about
the events?
STEVEN (O.S.)
Absolutely no. Uh uh.
DR. LESH
Can you be reasonably sure of not
letting any get started?
STEVEN (O.S.)
Its the last thing in the world we
want.
DR. LESH
Would your family welcome a serious
investigation of the disturbances,
by someone who could make firsthand observations?
ANGLE - STEVE FREELING
His eyes are dark shadows and the unflattering light features
the patches of stubble and parched lips. He speaks in hoarse
whispers, viewing these surroundings with great suspicion.
STEVEN
Dr. Lesh. We dont care about the
disturbances... the pounding... the
flashes or the music. We want you
to find our little girl.
FADE OUT.
FADE IN:

INT. FREELING HOME - STAIRWAY - UPPER HALLWAY - DAY
Dr. Les is mounting the stairs, followed by her two
associates, TAK and RYAN. Steve is in the lead while Robbie
keeps his distance in the rear.
STEVEN
I should warn you weve had to lock
off the room from the rest of the
house. Robbie sleeps with us now.
Dana, our oldest, spends a lot o
time with... with friends.
DR. LESH
How many disturbances have you
recorded in this room?
STEVEN
We dont go in there any more.
RYAN
Well record any psychotronic
energy or event.
DR. LESH
Ryan filmed an extraordinary
episode during a case in Redlands.
RYAN
A childs toy, small matchbox
vehicle, rolled seven feet across a
linoleum surface. The duration of
the event was seven hours.
STEVEN
Seven hours for what?
RYAN
For the vehicle to complete the
distance. This would never register
on the naked eye, but I have the
event on the time-lapse camera.
ANGLE - CHILDRENS BEDROOM DOOR
Steve takes out a key and feels for the lock. Dr. Lesh and
her assistants are looking around, checking out the hallway
as Steve swings the door open.
CLOSE - DR. LESH
She casually looks in.

40.

INT. CHILDRENS BEDROOM - DAY
HER POV - INSIDE THE ROOM
Inside is a junk pile of shattered furniture and toys. The
window is boarded up. Objects are in motion throughout the
room... the bed is hopping about, records are flying, a lamp
sails through. The clown is seated upside down on the
boxspring as it spins. Childrens picture books flapping
their covers like wings, cruise the upper reaches. A horse
flies by. Finally, a spinning compass plays a record while
flying toward the roar of the room, creating an eerie melody.
CLOSE PANNING - DR. LESH, TAK AND RYAN
All semblance of clinical cool is gone. They are blown away.

INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

Dianes VOICE is heard over two shaking hands trying not to
spill a pot of coffee as it fills a cup.
DIANES VOICE
None of us have been much fun to be
around. I guess you can tell I
havent slept very much. Steves
stayed home from work so much. Hes
been really wonderful. Really.
PAN UP from the shaking hands to Dr. Martha Lesh. She must
now use both hands, steady the coffee shes just poured. Her
assistants are in no better condition.
ANGLE - DIANE
She looks terrific. Her eyes are alert, hair combed back and
held with a bright yellow clip. She sips her coffee with rock
steady hands and softly inquires.
DIANE
How long have you been
investigating haunted houses?
DR. LESH
(embarrassed,
backtracking)
Well, Mrs. Freeling...
DIANE
Diane.

41.

DR. LESH
The determination as to whether
your home is haunted is not a very
easy one.
At that moment the coffee pot moves by itself to the tables
edge but doesnt spill. Dr. Lesh tries to overlook this, for
appearances sake.
DR. LESH
What I meant to say was this could
very well be a poltergeist
intrusion instead of the classic
haunting.
STEVEN
Theres a difference?
Two bright flashes of light distract Lesh and her associates.
RYAN
Anybody see that?
DIANE
Therell be two more in a few
seconds. They always travel in
pairs.
Tak sits holding the camera with his mouth hung open. Lesh
nudges him.
DR. LESH
Dr. Casey!
Tak snaps out of it and looks down to adjust the lens setting
just as two more flashes go off in the air.
DIANE
Gotta be quicker than that around
here.
RYAN
Its electrical... you can smell
the charge.
DIANE
You were saying poltergeists...
DR. LESH
(rattled)
I was saying they are generally
associated with an individual.

42.

DR. LESH(cont'd)
In the general vernacular,
hauntings seems to be connected
with an area... a house usually.
TAK
Poltergeist disturbances are of
fairly short duration. Perhaps a
couple of months. Hauntings can go
on for years.
Diane takes Steves hand, suddenly frightened.
DIANE
Are you telling me all this could
just end at any time?
DR. LESH
Unless its a haunting. But as a
rule, there seems to be no living
person around whom haunting
incidents revolve.
DIANE
Then we dont have much time, Dr.
Lesh. Because my daughter is alive

INT. LIVING ROOM - DUSK

THE FAMILY AND THE INVESTIGATORS
Everyone is assembled around the console TV. Ryan has a
Nakamichi cassette recorder on the coffee table and a pencil
microphone taped to the television speaker. Tak has erected
his Nikon on a small aluminum tripod aimed at the screen,
plus two infrared heat seeking cameras and monitors which
scan the entire living room. An electrostatic locator to
measure ionization and a magnometer that measures magnetic
changes. Diane is holding Steves hand.
Dana comes into the room with an overnight bag strapped
around her shoulders.
DIANE
Dana, Id like you to meet
doctor...
DANA
(clipped)
Its getting dark, Mom. I gotta go.
Ill call you from Trudies.

43.

STEVEN
She wont stay in the house after
dusk.
ROBBIE
(disgusted)
Shes got brains!
Diane flips on the set. A local news station is finishing the
report when Diane turns to channel 27.
DIANE
We receive better on this channel
but dont ask me why.
Dr. Lesh is thoroughly perplexed. She puts on her glasses as
Steve turns out the lamp and lights a cigarette. Diane
squeezes her husbands hand. The CAMERA PUSHES IN to the TV
screen and millions of particles of white air.
Diane turns the volume up and Ryan, wearing headsets,
flinches, adjusting down the volume on his recorder.
DIANE
Ill call her.
She says this so matter-of-factly that Dr. Lesh gasps. Diane
walks to the center of the living room, folds her hands in
front of her, collecting her thoughts, takes a very deep
breath and calls to the ceiling.
DIANE
Its mommy, sweetheart. We want to
talk to you. Baby, please answer.
Please talk to me, Carol Anne.
Dr. Lesh looks quickly to Tak and Ryan for their human
responses to this. Tak shrugs unnoticed. Ryan adjusts in his
chair and looks up at the ceiling.
E. Buzz prances into the room, looking up as if following on
the heels of someone with a treat.
DR. LESH
(to Tak breathlessly)
Look at the dog.
He sits up on his hind legs and begs to no one we see.
DIANE
Are you with us now? Can you say
hello to Daddy? Say hello to Daddy,
baby.

44.

CLOSE - RYAN
He tries hard not to smile. No matter. The suppressed laugh
is slapped away by what he now hears. Ryan grabs his headsets
in two hands, pressing them hard to his ears.
TAK
(tight whisper)
Good Lord...
Everyone turns away from Diane and back to the TV. They
strain their hearing, leaning forward, watching...
VOICE
(softly, sweetly, far
away)
Hello, Daddy.

*** PAGE MISSING ***
DIANE
Carol Anne. Where is this light?
DR. LESH
Tell her to stay away from it!
STEVEN
Tell her, Diane!!
DIANE
Sweetheart, the light is dangerous.
Dont go near it. Dont look at the
light.
Tak speaks into Dr. Leshs ear.
TAK
I cant believe it. Its just a
Zenith. But the voice could be C.B.
broadcasting from somewhere in the
house. Im taking a look.
DR. LESH
Its not a hoax.
TAK
Well see.
Tak takes off.

45.

E. Buzz barks into the air twice and catches something in his
mouth. No sooner does Dr. Lesh catch this out of the corner
of her eye when several midair electrical discharges
illuminate the room.
STEVEN
Whats that?!

INT. THE LIVING ROOM FLOOR - DUSK

From one of the flashes a number of tiny objects fall to the

E. Buzz immediately starts to sniff whatever it is.

He goes room to room looking for pranksters. When he gets to
the active bedroom he hesitates, listens through the door,
pulls in his courage and turns the knob. Of course, the door
is locked. Tak is never without a trick. He slips a file from
his utility belt and starts to jimmy the door. The lock gives
and Tak easily turns the knob, and lets out an agonizing
SCREAM! He falls backward holding his side, rolling over and
over until he is at the top of the carpeted staircase.

The little voice hidden behind all the static SCREAMS.
DIANE

His eyes light up.
CLOSE - MONITORS AND READBACKS
Come to life and start registering wildly.
Diane cant stand the screams. She holds her ears, in tears
now, imploring Dr. Lesh with her eyes.
DIANE
Carol Anne! Oh God!!
Steve holds Diane to him, she pushes away and SCREAMS at the
ceiling.
DIANE
You fucking bastard, shes just a
baby!
VOICE
Mommy! Mommy!
DIANE
(screaming through tears
to Dr. Lesh)
Help her! Cant you hear whats
happening?!

47.

We HEAR soft FOOTSTEPS running across the ceiling and down
the wall. Two lamps are turned over and smash to pieces on
the library table.
We next HEAR colossal FOOTFALLS BOOMING in pursuit. A gust of
interior wind races through Dianes clothes and hair. She
SCREAMS in combined joy and horror.
DIANE
She just moved through me. My God,
I felt her. I can smell her! She
went through my soul!!
Diane runs back to Steve and grabs his shirt, pulling him to
her.
DIANE
Smell my clothes. Its her. Its
her all over me.
Steve smells and cant believe it.
STEVEN
It is her!!
The footsteps in pursuit grow louder. Diane turns to face the
sound. Dr. Lesh turns. Steve and Ryan turn. A perfectly foul
smell precedes an implosion of displaced air. Almost the
sound of thunder, the impact is so great. Lesh, Diane and
Steve blow backward, their clothes flapping in the gale as
the force passes through each one of them and out the picture
window that cracks in a dozen places but does not shatter.
DR. LESH
(picking herself up)
Have you ever heard of the term
teleportation?
DIANE
Carol Anne!
ROBBIE
Thats like when Mr. Spock beams up
Captain Kirk on Star Trek.
DR. LESH
Just about. In a recent case,
objects which disappeared from a
house would be seen much later
falling to the ground outside.
DIANE
Carol Anne doesnt answer. Steve?

48.

DR. LESH
(to Steve)
Where exactly do you suppose Carol
Anne was playing before she
vanished from sight?
DIANE
Her bedroom closet. And she wasnt
playing.
DR. LESH
Lets go up there.
STEVEN
It wont let you in.
DR. LESH
Well just see about that.
Lesh practically rolls up her sleeves and heads for the
stairway, the rest following.
INT. BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE - DUSK
As they come around the corner they run smack into Tak, just
coming down the last step, rubbing his side.
DR. LESH
What happened to you?
TAK
I was just about to check out the
locked bedroom when... I dont
know... something took a bite out
of me.
Robbie gets very scared.
ROBBIE
You got bit?
TAK
That or the worst muscle spasm in
the world.
DR. LESH
Roll up your shirt. Lets have a
look.
Tak turns to face the hall light and untucks his shirt,
rolling it up. Then rolling up his T-shirt. Everyone crowds
in to see.

ANGLE - TAKS STOMACH AND SIDE
Teeth marks bear out Taks story. The unusual thing is, the
bite wraps all the way around his side from kidneys to navel.
A pink and partially bruised eleven-inch crescent impression.
CLOSE - ROBBIE
Eye level with it, his little mouth hanging open.
ROBBIE
Wow!
Dr. Lesh takes a tentative step up the stairs then turns back
demonstratively.
DR. LESH
Lets everybody spend the night
down here.
STEVEN
Honey, I want you and Robbie to
come with me. Well sleep in town

DIANE

HALLWAY - RYAN

Ryan sits in a chair facing the staircase and the upper level
of rooms
His spectroscopic camera equipment is aiming directly up the
stairs. Lesh pats Ryan on the shoulders, he nearly jumps out
of his skin. They speak in whispers so as not to disturb the
others.
RYAN
Jesus, my heart.
DR. LESH
(whispering)
Shhh. More thrills than grading
papers, wouldnt you say?
RYAN
(whispering)
I can leave any time, you know.
This isnt the Army and youre not

If push comes to shove, I bet Ill
beat you to the door.
(indicating monitors)
Any movement out of those things?
RYAN

Lesh goes to the console TV and, assuming everyone is asleep,
she turns it off. In a very small voice Diane leans on her
elbow.
DIANE
Please. Leave it on.
Dr. Lesh smiles, its the first time weve seen her do this
and it reminds Diane at once of her favorite story-book
grandma who bakes cookies and knits comforters.
CLOSE - DIANE
She smiles back and motions for Dr. Lesh to come over.
DIANE
When things get quiet like now I
can imagine how all this must look
from you end. Im really
embarrassed.
DR. LESH
Oh, nonsense. Ill tell you what is
embarrassing. My being here with
you nice people. Parapsychology
isnt something you master in.
There are no certificates of
graduation, no license to practice.
Im a professional psychologist who
spends most of her time engaged in
this ghostly hobby, which makes me,
I suppose, the most irresponsible
sixty-one-year old woman I know.
DIANE
You were so funny. Your hands were
shaking a mile a minute.
Diane starts to giggle. Its a release and Dr. Lesh joins
her.
DR. LESH
It isnt over. Im perfectly
terrified. Its all these things we
dont understand. I feel like the
protohuman, stepping of the forest
primeval and seeing the moon for
the first time. Throwing rocks at
it.

52.

DIANE
You mean someday well understand
these things?
DR. LESH
When its recognized for what it
is. As any science. Understanding
and sponsorship seem always to be
one hundred years behind ridicule
and doubt. Out of this experience,
should we capture a high resolution
photograph of a genuine
manifestation Time Magazine will
still put President Reagan on its
next cover.
ROBBIE
If I got killed would I come back
as a ghost and get stuck in the
house like my sister?
DIANE
Your sister isnt dead, Robbie.
ROBBIE
If I got killed could I visit her
and show her how to get back here
if you tied a rope around me and
held it tight? Then somebody could
come get me and we could move
somewhere else?
DR. LESH
Some people believe that when you
die your soul goes to heaven.
ROBBIE
When Grampa was dead I looked at
him on the hospital bed and I was
watchin, but nothing went out of
him.
DIANE
His soul was invisible. You
couldnt see it going to the sky.
ROBBIE
How come Grandpa isnt on
television with Carol Anne?
DR. LESH
Some people believe that when you
die there is a wonderful light.

53.

DR. LESH(cont'd)
As bright as the sun but it doesnt
hurt to look into it. All the
answers to all the questions you
want to know are inside that light.
And when you walk into it... you
become a part of it forever. Now,
some people die, but they dont
know theyre gone.
ROBBIE
They think theyre still alive?
DR. LESH
Thats right. Maybe they didnt
want to die. Maybe they werent
ready. Maybe they hadnt begun to
live yet or lived a long, long time
anyway, but wanted more life. They
resist going into the light no
matter how hard the light wants
them. They hang around, watch TV,
watch their friends grow up,
feeling all unhappy or jealous and
those feelings are bad, they hurt.
And then some people just get lost
on the way to the light. They need
someone to lead them there.
ROBBIE
So some people get angry and throw
things around like in my bedroom.
DR. LESH
Yes. Just like in school. There are
people who are nice to you. And
people who are mean.
ROBBIE
I got beat up once by three kids.
They took my lunch money. Maybe
they got hit by a truck and are
upstairs right now.
DIANE
Lets get some shuteye, whadya
say, partner?
ROBBIE
Goodnight, Mom. Nite lady. Nite,
Dad. Nite, E. Buzz.
Robbie puts his head down on the pillow and Diane and Dr.
Lesh share a warm look over him. Robbie sits back up suddenly
and looks at the TV set.

Flanked by four banks of monitors and oscilloscopes, Taks
stomach growls. He turns back looking over his shoulder at
the kitchen.

He leans his chair back on its hind legs until his head
reaches around the corner. Tak pfffts to Ryan. Ryan looks
up from a Penthouse Magazine that he is studying by penlight.
Tak gestures for Ryan to relieve him for a few minutes.
FULL SHOT - BOTTOM OF STAIRCASE
Tak gets up and Ryan sits down, getting right back into his

Ryan puts a Walkman over his ears and pops a Herbie Hancock

INT. KITCHEN - TAK - NIGHT

The refrigerator is the perfect target for Taks
housebreaking skills. He turns once, looking over his
shoulder before opening the Amana... the light inside bathes
everything in white. Tak takes out a salad bowl and noshes
from that, but his chewing is too loud so he opts for a
beautiful New York steak wrapped in cellophane.
Placing the steak on the dark counter, Tak stuffs a chicken
leg into his mouth and searches the kitchen for a steak
knife. He pulls his flashlight from his hip pocket and beings
pulling drawers...
A new sound is added to his search. A CRAWLING GUSHY SOUND
that bubbles and softly hisses. Tak turns and sees a shape
moving along the counter where he put the steak. Approaching,
Tak tilts his flashlight so the beam hits the object moving
on the counter.

Tak is catching his breath, his head lowered in frame. He
stands up suddenly checking his complexion in the mirror.
SMASH CUT TO:
HIS MIRRORED REFLECTION
His reflection is a ROTTING CORPSE, hair wild and streaming,
his mouth open in a crazy way, teeth hanging by leathery
threads, a funeral suit from the neck down.

We SEE the empty hallway and staircase in black and white on
one screen. One the other a spectroscopic breakdown of color
patterns in infrared.
The picture on the screen becomes grainy, smoky. A bright
glowly substance begins to form into tendrils that move down
the stairs and very close to the cameras. The black and white
monitor shows what the human eye captured. The color infrared
shows what the technology captured.

The smoky substance twists and melts and forms what appears
to be the shape of a mans back. The shape moves in front of
the CAMERA and we see what could be an OLD MAN looking over
his shoulder with a suspicious expression, and then walking
past a little girl, not Carol Anne, holding a ball. She
wanders through the living room as if lost. Suddenly, the
living room is filled with manifestations. FOUR MEN in burlap
type coats, floppy hats, denim and boots face away from the
CAMERAS, a WOMAN dressed in the style of the 1920s moves
through the room, tears on her face -- people of all ages and
descriptions wander aimlessly, lost and sad through the
living room.
No manifestation makes contact with any other. They dont
even seem to be aware that others exist -- an OLD WOMAN
glances at the CAMERAS disinterestedly -- and a YOUNG BOY
moves toward the CAMERA and evaporates.
The screen suddenly becomes BLACK, filled by two glowing
beams -- the beam pull back and we realize they are EYES of a
scary old man. It is the face of pure chaotic horror. A
vision of madness and murder.

Diane hangs desperately onto
carefully through the house,
Carol Anne and Robbies room
through the door. She knocks

101

any tangible reality. She moves
cleaning up. When she passes
Diane hesitates. She listens
softly and prays.

65.

DIANE
(lightly)
Hello. Anyone home?
(she raps softly)
Carol Anne?
Diane slips her hand down to the doorknob. Knowing it is
always locked she feels safe in trying it -- the knob turns
in her hand. Tak never locked up after his episode. Diane
GASPS and jumps back. As much as she wants to, Diane wont go
in. She backs into her own bedroom and shuts the door.

102

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

102

She turns and sees the bed is not made. Diane pulls off the
covers and the sheets, making them ready for the washing
machine. Dust rises off the bed and Diane SNEEZES. As she
tilts her head back for a second sneeze she freezes looking
at the wall over her head. The sneeze never materializes.
ANGLE - THE WALL
The STAIN HAS GROWN. It is three feet in diameter and shaped
like a black rose. Little black, wiggly lines, like veins,
scribble away from the black pistil in all directions. Diane
flinches and steps away from it. She sees a picture on her
other wall and determines to hang it over the stain.

103

EXT. THE TOP OF A HILL - DAY

103

STEVE AND TEAGUE
MR. TEAGUE
Im so very proud of this place.
Steve and Teague stand on a hill overlooking the entire
Cuesta Verde Estates. Teagues Bronco sits off to one side.
STEVEN
Ive been up here once or twice.
Diane calls it Vanity Point.
MR. TEAGUE
So whos to say an artist shouldnt
step back from his easel to admire
the sum of his parts?
STEVEN
(almost forgetting his
ordeal for a few seconds
of mental freedom)

66.

STEVEN(cont'd)
When they build our model home,
there was nothing down there. Just
freshly turned earth and a lotta
wooden stakes and miles and miles
of string.
MR. TEAGUE
One of your children was born in
your house.
STEVEN
(not smiling now)
Carol Anne.
MR. TEAGUE
I understand shes missed a lot of
school lately. Trasks daughters
in the same nursery class. She have
the flu as well?
STEVEN
Yeah, weve all got the same thing.
MR. TEAGUE
Im sorry. I didnt see her.
STEVEN
Oh, shes around.
MR. TEAGUE
Are you?
STEVEN
(his mind in the valley,
snaps out of it)
Am I what?
MR. TEAGUE
Are you thinking of leaving Cuesta
Verde?
STEVEN
(dazed)
I cant believe how a day can be so
beautiful. You wonder how anyone
can have a problem in the world on
a day like this.
MR. TEAGUE
(kicking up some sod with
his heel)
Nice spot for a bay window,
wouldnt you agree?

67.

STEVEN
If youre living up here, great.
Wouldnt be so terrific from the
valley, looking up at a lotta
houses cutting into these hills.
MR. TEAGUE
You dont have to live in the
valley any more.
STEVEN
What are you getting at?
MR. TEAGUE
Phase Five is going up right where
were standing. This could be your
master bedroom suite. That could be
your view. You interested?
STEVEN
Mr. Teague, thats a very generous
offer but Im not a developer.
MR. TEAGUE
Youre responsible for 42% of
sales, almost half of what were
looking at down there. Almost
seventy million dollars of
dwellings and property. Maybe a
generation of security that no one
can put a price tag on. We should
have made you a full partner three
years ago... I dont want to lose
you now.
Steve doesnt know what to think. So much is piling up so
suddenly. Its a golden opportunity that two weeks ago would
have meant a Hawaiian vacation and days of happiness and
celebration. Steve turns around to take in the view.

104

EXT. THE VIEW - DAY

104

CAMERA PANS AROUND 180 DEGREES
This whole conversation has taken place just inches outside a
quiet little cemetery with picket fences and both ancient and
recent headstones.
Steve scratches and gestures to the three-acre memorial park.
STEVEN
Not much room for a pool.

68.

MR. TEAGUE
We own the land. Weve already made
arrangements to relocate the
cemetery.
STEVEN
Can you do that? I mean, isnt it
rather... I dont know...
sacrilegious?
MR. TEAGUE
Dont worry about it. Its not an
ancient tribal burial ground. Its
just... people. Besides, weve done
it before.
STEVEN
When?
MR. TEAGUE
In 76. Right down there.
STEVEN
(struck)
Cuesta Verde?
MR. TEAGUE
All three hundred acres. It was
quite a job, let me tell you.
STEVEN
(to himself, his mind
racing)
I never heard anything about it.
MR. TEAGUE
Well, its not something you go
around advertising on billboards
and the sides of buses.
Steve is speechless. He looks back and forth between the
existing cemetery and Cuesta Verde Estates below.
MR. TEAGUE
What are you worried about?
Relatives and friends can visit
their loved ones at Broxton
Memorial Park. Its only five
minutes further out for Christs
sake.

69.

STEVEN
(quietly, to himself)
Five minutes. I guess thats no
great hardship. I suppose that
would be okay.
MR. TEAGUE
Okay with whom?
STEVEN
Whomever might complain.
MR. TEAGUE
Nobodys complained up til now.

INT. PSYCHIC RESEARCH CENTER - LECTURE HALL - DAY

106

DR. LESH AND A SENIOR ADVISOR, ANTHONY FARROW.
They are sitting in an empty lecture hall. Monitors are
everywhere. Several people are filing out. Lesh is exhausted.
Apparently shes been through quite an ordeal. Anthony Farrow
is twenty years old than Dr. Lesh, which puts him into his
early eighties.
He puts a comforting arm around her and sits on the desk,
smiling like the wizened sage he is.
FARROW
In a word?
He hands her back the video tapes.
DR. LESH
In a word.
FARROW
Too graphic!
DR. LESH
It was the episode as it occurred.
FARROW
Perhaps.

70.

DR. LESH
Oh, Tony... you too?
FARROW
I so wish to accept what I saw. Im
only steps away from the old wooden
bridge myself. To believe that
something exists on the other side
would be like a warm light in the
window.
DR. LESH
Perhaps if tendrils of ectoplasm
were all that showed up?
FARROW
Better.
DR. LESH
A smoky shape lasting merely an
instant.
FARROW
Even better.
DR. LESH
Nothing on tape at all... only
sounds, rappings, a sigh.
FARROW
Youd still be answering questions.
Theyd all want to go back to the
house tonight. You gave them too
much, Martha. Too much too soon.
Nothing was left to the
imagination. This isnt a science
yet. Its still a sideshow and your
troubadours were not in their makeup.
DR. LESH
And these? What do you make of
these?
She gestures to the dozens of jewelry pieces on the desk.
Farrow picks up a beautiful brooch. He holds it up to the
light.
FARROW
Its the real McCoy, thats one
thing for certain.

71.

Farrow pins the brooch on Leshs sweater and takes an antique
ring, placing it on her finger.
FARROW
Dear Martha. May we cross that
bridge together someday? May all we
believe be true. May we picnic in
the clouds.
Dr. Lesh starts to laugh and punches Farrow on his leg.
DR. LESH
You old con artist. If only you
were fifty years younger.
FARROW
Let me give you some advice. Secret
a few of those gems. Come out of
this with something in your pocket.
The National Enquirer pays more for
inventing what we must bust our
rumps investigating and for what?
DR. LESH
Okay, pops! Im making you the
accessory in this crime.
She picks out a set of earrings and stuffs them into her
change purse. Farrow laughs as Dr. Lesh starts to fold up the
napkin containing the stones and jewelry. Suddenly Farrow
stops her, reaching for something in the pile.
FARROW
This is interesting.
He picks up a thin, wiry clip that looks like it could be a
dog muzzle for a miniature poodle.
FARROW
Did this teleport with everything
else?
DR. LESH
Yes, I picked it up myself. Why?
He turns it over in his hand.
FARROW
Its a staple, a clamp for the jaw.
DR. LESH
Not something youd wear to the
masquerade ball.

72.

FARROW
No, but you would wear it to your
own funeral. Its a morticians
trick. It prevents the mouth from
suddenly dropping open when the
body is in repose. It discourages a
great deal of embarrassment and...
fainting.
DR. LESH
(with a shiver she looks
at her watch)
Oh darn, I promised Id be back
before dark.
FARROW
Martha, my dear. Why dont you let
Tangina have a go?
DR. LESH
(sourly)
I was afraid youd suggest that.
Tanginas so... melodramatic.
FARROW
Yes. But shes a house-cleaner and
right now with what you tell me
about that little girl, I think
its high time you brought out your
big guns.

EXT. CUESTA VERDE ESTATES, PHASE ONE - NIGHT

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

MOVING SHOT
We are following Steve and Diane. They seem to be gazing down
as they walk through their home. CAMERA WIDENS to reveal Ryan
and Lesh ahead of the Freelings. They appear to be following
something, also looking down at their feet. CAMERA PANS DOWN,
expecting to find E. Buzz at the head of this train.
Instead...
We meet TANGINA BARRONS, astrologist, clairvoyant, midget.

73.

She is dressed in a California Hawaiian print dress, wears
her hair in a beehive, dons aviator sunglasses and casually
sips coffee from a mug as she explores the Freeling home.
Tangina stops and looks at her followers. She speaks with a
very polite Southern accent.
TANGINA
Would you all mind hangin back.
Youre jamming my frequencies.
They oblige and Tangina waddles her way down the hall and up
the stairs unaccompanied.
DR. LESH
I know what youre thinking. Youll
have to take my word on this. Shes
cleaned many houses. Her gifts are
well documented at the
parapsychology laboratory at Duke
University, University of Virginia,
the...
Diane is becoming more and more distraught over something.
DIANE
We havent heard a word from Carol
Anne since last night.
TANGINA (O.S.)
Why is this door locked, Mr.
Freeling?
Steve looks up the stairs, hes about to answer but instead
decides to concentrate. A pause.
DIANE
Answer her.
STEVEN
(softly)
I am.
Tangina appears at the upper rail and looks down between the
banister posts.
TANGINA
I am addressing the living?
STEVEN
(giving up)
Im sorry. Thats the room my son
and daughter occupy.

74.

DR. LESH
We believe its the heart of the
house.
TANGINA
This house has many hearts.
Tangina turns away and continues her search.
ANGLE - LIVING ROOM
Steve turns to Diane and Lesh and Ryan, pulling them into a
circle of whispers.
STEVEN
(whispering)
I was trying to answer with my
mind. She couldnt hear me. I
thought you said Tangina Barrons
was an extraordinary clairvoyant.
From far away and well out of earshot Tangina answers.
TANGINA (O.S.)
(upstairs)
I am. I just dont like trick
answers.
DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

109

The CAMERAS are all set up. The Zenith console is now the
centerpiece of this room. The rest of the furniture has been
piled against the walls although were not sure if this is
Dianes work or early poltergeist disturbances. Tangina sees
herself on the video monitor and smiles into the CAMERA. She
waves and watches herself waving on the monitor. She makes a
funny face and gets a huge thrill at seeing it in black and
white. Diane and Steve stand divorced from this. They have
become bit players as Tangina takes center stage.
TANGINA
Can you make my face look bigger?
Thinking this is a scientific request, Ryan ZOOMS IN filling
the monitors with Tangina.
TANGINA
Look at me for cryin out loud!
Youd never suspect I was just a
teeny little thing, would ya?

75.

DR. LESH
Tangina, could we get on with this,
please?
Tangina pulls out a lipstick and freshens her makeup, all the
while watching herself in the monitor.
TANGINA
Ive never been on TV before.
She steps back and looks into the CAMERA. She adds to her
already thick Texas accent. The melodrama gushes out of her.
TANGINA
Yes, it was me all the time, not
that fussy harlot from the office.
I shot J.R. Ewing! I blew his
little pecker right into the gulf
of Mexico. I...
(embarrassed)
Oh, I swore on television.
No one is laughing. Especially Diane and Steve. They are
rather appalled. Tangina immediately pulls back. She becomes
an adult again and walks into the center of the room.
TANGINA
(to Diane)
Honey, cmere and give me your
hand.
Diane hesitates and looks over at Dr. Lesh.
TANGINA
Im not gonna bitecha.
Diane slowly walks to Tangina and reaches down with her hand.
TANGINA
Cmon down here. Youre gonna give
me whiplash lookin up at you.
Diane smiles and kneels. She is eye level with Tangina.
TANGINA
(softly, just for Diane to
hear)
Your daughter is alive and in this
house.
The tears come immediately. Diane breaks down, sobbing, the
first confirmation of her own belief from the outside.

76.

Tangina hugs her, patting the back of Dianes head
reassuringly. Steve starts to come over to comfort but
Tangina waves him off and mouths...
TANGINA
... a glass of water.
ANGLE - DR. LESH
She sits down and smiles. Relieved, looks to Ryan. Ryan is
filming it.
TANGINA
(to Dr. Lesh)
Where was the last incident of
biolocation?
Dr. Lesh points to the air just above Tanginas head.
TANGINA
I have my strongest feeling, the
point of origin is inside the
childs closet. Upstairs.
DIANE
(through tears)
Yes. I feel that too.
TANGINA
(to Diane)
Now, honey. Are you gonna be real
strong for me? For your daughter? I
can do absolutely nothing without
your faith in this world and your
love for the children.
DIANE
I will. Believe me, I will.
TANGINA
Will you do anything I say? Even if
it comes contrary to your beliefs
as a human bein and as a
Christian?
DIANE
Oh yes. Please.
TANGINA
(cupping Dianes face and
bringing their eyes
together)

77.

TANGINA(cont'd)
Then lets get on our feet and go
get your daughter.
Diane laugh-cries and rises. Tangina starts to rise but then
realizes...
TANGINA
(brightly)
Oh... I am standin.

CLOSE - TELEVISION CONSOLE
Static snow grates again on our nerves.
ANGLE - FULL
Diane is in her self-appointed position, the center of the
room awaiting notice from Tangina Barrons who checks through
a lot of items laid out on a tablecloth on the living room
floor.
TANGINA
(checklisting)
Towels, red ribbon,
handkerchiefs... Howre the tennis
balls coming?
Ryan and Dr. Lesh are painting numbers on each of six tennis
balls and then carefully signing their names. String hangs
across the ceiling and to each wall coming together in the
air six feet above the floor to form a square.
Steve runs in with several pounds of rope slung around his
shoulder.
STEVEN
Its all I could find.
TANGINA
Itll do. Hows the bath water
doin?
STEVEN
I shut it off. Its ready.
TANGINA
Then I dont see any reason why we
shouldnt get started.
(to Diane)
All right, honey. Call out to her.

78.

In the low light of the living room, Diane stands in the
center like a frightened contestant about to audition a song.
She says a prayer under her breath and looks skyward.
DIANE
Carol Anne... Carol Anne... Its
Mommy. Can you hear me tonight?
TV CONSOLE - STATIC
Nothing.
DIANE
Carol Anne. Can you tell Mommy
hello?
TV CONSOLE - STATIC
Nothing.
CLOSE - TANGINA
Her eyes are closed and her breathing becomes irregular. She
licks at her dry lips and motions to Diane.
TANGINA
Try again.
DIANE
Can you say hello to Daddy? Daddy
and I miss you so much. So much. We
love you so much. Can you say
hello?
CLOSE - TANGINA
Shaking her head.
TANGINA
Shes under restraint!
This news hits like a shock wave. Steve and Diane almost
answer at one.
STEVEN AND DIANE
(overlapping)
Shes what?! What do you mean?!
Whos restraining her?!
TANGINA
Quickly. Who is she more afraid of?
You or your husband?

79.

DIANE
Shes afraid of neither.
TANGINA
Which one of you does she answer to
first?
STEVEN
Shes always gone to Diane.
TANGINA
When shes naughty, whom does she
hide from?
STEVEN
Shes a well-behaved child. Weve
raised her with manners and...
TANGINA
(losing her patience)
Look folks, Im not the child abuse
squad. I need a quick answer.
DIANE
Steve decides the punishment. The
children have always known that.
STEVEN
(protesting)
Now wait a minute, Diane. I dont
call that fair. Ive never laid a
hand...
Tangina still has her eyes closed. She motions Steve to come
over.
TANGINA
Fight about it later, meantime get
your ass over here.
Steve obeys. Diane is lost. Dr. Lesh has never experienced
anything like this before. Ryan has his eye to the video tape
camera.
TANGINA
Tell Carol Anne to answer!
Steve is uncomfortable in speaking to thin air. He clears his
voice.
TANGINA
Tell her!

80.

STEVEN
(very politely)
Honey, its Daddy. Can you hear
me... Sweetpea?
TANGINA
Cut the crap and call her. Loud.
STEVEN
(a little louder)
Carol Anne. Its Daddy.
TANGINA
Again.
STEVEN
(a little louder)
Its Daddy, sweetheart.
TANGINA
Be cross with her.
STEVEN
Why...?
TANGINA
Be angry with her or youll never
see her again!
STEVEN
(quickly, more aroused,
harsh)
Carol Anne, this is your father
speaking.
TANGINA
Tell her if she doesnt answer
shes in big trouble.
STEVEN
Answer me right now or youre in
real hot water!
TANGINA
Tell her shell get spanked.
STEVEN
(aside to Tangina)
We never spank the children.
DIANE
(intervening)
Goddamnit, Steven, tell her!

81.

STEVEN
If you dont answer your parents
youre going to get a real
spanking. From both of us.
TANGINA
Swear. Swear.
STEVEN
(really getting into it)
Damnit! Damnit! You hear me?!
CAROL ANNES VOICE
(far away from the TV
speaker)
Mommy, help me!
TANGINA
(really breathing hard,
sweating)
Shes away from him!
DIANE
Away from who... that thing we saw?
Is she all right?
TANGINA
(huffing like shes
running)
Diane. Is there a light?
DIANE
Carol Anne, do you see the light?
CAROL ANNES VOICE
Hes chasing me, Mommy...
(screams)
TANGINA
Tell her to run to the light.
DIANE
(looking at Dr. Lesh)
No!
TANGINA
They will follow her to it. They
have been following her for weeks.
You must tell her what I say!
DR. LESH
Tell her. Go ahead, Diane.

82.

DIANE
Run for the lights. Run as fast as
you can!
CAROL ANNES VOICE
Mommy!! Are you in the light?
DIANE
No, honey, Im...
TANGINA
Tell her you are!!
DIANE
Its a lie!!
TANGINA
You cant choose between life and
death when were dealing with what
is in between. Tell her before its
too late!
DIANE
Run to the light, Carol Anne, Mommy
is in the light!
TANGINA
Tell her youre waiting for her.
Diane is now crying out of angry frustration and deceit.
DIANE
Mommy is in the light waiting for
you!
(she wheels on Tangina)
I hate you for this!!
TANGINA
Quick, upstairs everyone! Bring
everything.

Everybody crowds around. Tangina turns to Steve, her
breathing coarse with phlegm and wheezing.

Open it.
This time Steve doesnt hesitate. He has the key already in
the lock and swings open the door.

113

INT. CHILDRENS BEDROOM - NIGHT

It is like a storm at sea inside. So much destroyed minutia
speeds through the air it is not unlike a blizzard at night.
The SOUND is a CHORUS of MOANING; and RAVING.
A VOCAL ASYLUM FROM A BLACK PLACE WHERE ALL SOULS WAIT FOR
TRANSIT.
A CACOPHONY OF MUSIC REVERBERATES THROUGHOUT. Nothing
specific, only madness and nonsense.
INTO THIS WALL OF NOISE AND TORMENT TANGINA BARRONS APPEARS.
She looks around the room, squinting in the low in blowing
dust and particles. Things, objects, plasma globules fly at
her. She sees...
THE CLOSET. THE LIGHT IS THERE! It is so bright there is no
looking into it without retinal damage. Great blue-yellow
shards of light spill into the room, defined by the thick
atmosphere.
TANGINA
(screaming to be heard)
RYAN! GET DOWNSTAIRS AND WAIT BY
THE TARGET!
A heavy section of lamp hurls from the other side of the room
right for Tanginas head. Just as it reaches her it slows
down to a winsome hover and falls to the floor at her feet.
TANGINA
(top of her lungs to be
heard)
STEVEN! GIVE ME THE TENNIS BALL
MARKED NUMBER ONE.

Ryan looks up. There is a flash and immediately a tennis ball
falls from mid-space and lands on the floor at his feet. He
picks it up and looks at the inscriptions.
RYAN

Its my handwriting. It came right
out of the fucking air!

117

light.

There is

there is

a mid air flash as ball number two materializes from
and Ryan catches it. As he inspects the signatures,
another light flash and ball number three follows
him on the head.

INT. UPSTAIRS BY THE BEDROOM DOOR - NIGHT

BACK!

Steve goes to work on this.
TANGINA
SHES JUST AT THE MOUTH OF THE
CORRIDOR. TELL HER TO STOP! TELL
HER NOT TO MOVE INTO THE LIGHT!
DIANE
(with all her heart)
CAROL ANNE, LISTEN TO ME. DO NOT GO
INTO THE LIGHT. STOP WHERE YOU ARE.
TURN AWAY FROM IT. DONT LOOK AT
IT!
TANGINA
WHERE IS THE ROPE!?
Steve hands it to her. Tangina wont wield it. It is too
strung out and she is too small.
TANGINA
STEVE, HELP ME WITH THIS!
Steve enters the blast furnace of energy and wind and takes
one end of the rope.
TANGINA
THROW IT INTO THE LIGHT!
He throws in the whip holding onto one end.

120

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

120

There is another mid flash and the end of rope thrown
biolcates out from between the string and falls in a pile on
the living room rug. Ryan picks up his end and yells back...
RYAN
GOT IT --!

121

INT. CHILDRENS BEDROOM - NIGHT
Tangina and Steve are holding the other end and the red
ribbon is very close to the closet entrance.
TANGINA
Tell him to take up the slack
gently. Yell when he sees the
ribbon.

121

86.

Tangina is marking inches and feet onto the rope with her
lipstick, just to their side of the red ribbon. She nods to
Steve.
TANGINA
IM LOSING MY VOICE -- SHOUT DOWN
TO HIM!!

TAKE UP THE SLACK!
The ROAD OF WIND inside grows stronger.
TANGINA
HE DIDNT HEAR YOU.
STEVEN

Ryan has heard and starts to gently take up the slack. When
it is taut he is fed the rope one inch at a time.

Diane transfers the information.
DIANE
STOP -- IT THROUGH!
Tangina looks at the last calibration.

87.

TANGINA
ONLY THIRTY-SIX INCHES WIDE, NOT
MUCH ROOM. HERE, TIE THIS END
AROUND MY WAIST.
A look of horror crosses Dianes face.
DIANE
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOURE DOING?
TANGINA
IM GOING IN AFTER HER!
DIANE
SHE WONT COME TO YOU. LET ME GO.
TANGINA
YOUVE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE!
DIANE
NEITHER HAVE YOU!
TANGINA
I NEVER WANTED TO! I STILL DONT!
Diane steps into the room, blasted back by two several GUSTS
OF WIND aimed specifically at her.
Steve has already started to tie the rope around his own
waist. Hes decided to go.
TANGINA
YOU CANT. WHOS GOING TO HOLD THIS
END?!
Steve realizes its true. Diane pulls the rope from Steve and
secures it around her waist. Steve ties two clove hitches and
faces his wife.
DIANE
(above the wind)
I LOVE YOU!
STEVEN
I LOVE YOU!
They kiss, part, and Steve and Tangina get a hold of the end
of the rope.
Dr. Lesh runs into the storm and helps to hold.

88.

TANGINA
NO, NO! GO DOWN AND HELP RYAN PULL,
BUT ONLY WHEN I SAY SO! ONLY WHEN I
SAY!
Dr. Lesh runs downstairs and Diane takes one look back at
Steve.
DIANE
DONT LET GO, YOU GUYS!
STEVEN
NEVER!

She moves into it... the light swallowing her. Tangina
watches the calibrations and stops feeding when the
indications are that Diane is in the center of the infinite
void.

Tangina is back in her trance. Sweat beads across her brow,
only to be blown into horizontal rivulets by the eighty miles
an hour interior wind.
STEVEN
HOW WILL WE KNOW IF SHES GOT HER?
Tangina doesnt answer... she starts her irregular breathing.
STEVEN
WHEN WILL WE KNOW?
(he looks back at her)
HEY!
TANGINA
(starts to speak)

YOU SAID NO!! YOU SAID TO STAY OUT

Tanginas trace doesnt include Steve. She does not hear him.
He thinks she is leading his family into the light and
beyond.
Steve panics and starts to pull the rope back.
STEVEN
DIANE!! CAROL ANNE!!
Tangina snaps out of her trance to find Steve withdrawing the
rope with all his might. She lets out a SCREAM.
TANGINA
STEVEN, NOT YET!! RYAN. RYAN,
PULL!!
Steve gives one more tug and a flash of electrical energy
explodes from the closet. A LOW GROWL is heard from the
light. The GROWL HITS THE LOWER SOUND REGISTERS AND THE
ENTIRE ROOM SHAKES FROM ITS VERY FOUNDATIONS.

THE FACE OF THE BEAST EMERGES FROM THE CLOSET LIGHT. FACE IS

They are covered from head to toe in a jellied substance,

leaving a trail behind.
Steve turns on the water and puts Diane and Carol Anne into
the tub. Ryan follows him behind with his portable table
video equipment. The water quickly turns into a bright pink
as the jelly substance dissolves and foments like bubblebath.

sits by Robbie. They are bowed in prayer, holding hands.

ROBBIE
Rub-a-dub-dub. Thanks for the grub.
Yeah God!
Everybody LAUGHS. Diane, with an enormous amount of gray in
her hair, reaches into her purse, almost as an afterthought
and takes out an envelope addressed to the Freeling family.
DIANE

Diane passes a color Polaroid around the table.

Diane comes into the hall in her robe. Her hair is pinned up

She turns to go and sees that the closet light is off. Diane
reaches into the closet with her hand... feeling for the
switch. Her hand flails in the dark until it feels something.
Diane flinches and pulls. The closet light comes on and Diane
lets go of the pull cord. She smiles again at her children

The robe falls in a bundle around her feet. She steps out of

she inches her way into the hot water up to her neck, Diane
sighs. She closes her eyes. The steam rises to the ceiling.

The tub water gurgles into the overflow drain just under the
spigot. Diane takes a washrag, throws it by her feet, and
uses her big toe to clog the overflow drain to stop the
annoying sound.

Nite, Robbie.
ROBBIE
Nite, Carol Anne.
Robbie looks over at the new rocking chair. The old clown
doll is sitting there quietly. Robbie takes the shirt by his
bed and tries tossing it over the head of the clown doll but
he misses. The shirt falls across the arm rest and starts the
chair rocking. Robbie shrugs and turns out the light by his
bed. Only the soft moonlight from the window and the warm
light from the partially opened closet give any ambient
illumination to the room. Outside the SOUND of a car passing,

Dressed in her nightgown and robe, Diane combs out her long,
silky hair. She throws her head forward so all the hair in
the back can cover her face. Stroking from the back of her
neck, Diane gets out all the tangles. Satisfied, Diane flips
her head straight up so all her hair can fly back around her
shoulders. The shiny gray-brown hair flies straight up into
the air and upon reaching its full height... it freezes and
doesnt come down.
E. Buzz turns and runs out of the room. DIANE IS LOOKING AT
HERSELF IN THE MIRROR WHEN THIS HAPPENS.

The STAIN STOPS GROWING AND STARTS TO BREATHE, moving in and
out like the hairy body of a mutant tarantula.

Dianes lips are pressed flat against her gums and mushed in
counter-clockwise circles, how a kiss might appear if only
the receiver were visible.
Her hair is allowed to fall around her shoulder and she
struggles away from the force that has held her. She goes
straight for the door. It CLOSES IN HER FACE. Diane turn
insanely when her arm is nearly wretched from its socket. She
us flung onto her bed right under the spider stain.

Robbie, sitting up in bed, looks all around for the clown
doll. He dares even to look on the floor. It is nowhere in
sight.
Robbies breathing quickens. He knows where he now must look.
After all no child can ever sleep until knowing the night is
in order. Lying on his stomach, Robbie slowly lowers himself
head first to the floor of his bed, in preparation to look
under it. He very, very carefully lifts the dust ruffle and
lets the top of his head touch the rug. Robbie is upside-down
as he looks into the darkness under his bed.

The clown is there, face to face with him, smiling

Diane lets out a chilling SCREAM. Her robe is torn away from
her nightgown and hurled into the air. Diane tries to get up
but a pressure upon her chest defeats her best effort.
CLOSE - DIANES BREASTS
The nightgown is suddenly torn away revealing her breast.
They are kneaded and flattened. Hulking finger impressions
can be seen sinking deeply into her. Dianes hysteria doesnt
make any difference. Now her legs are spread apart and a
great pressure over her pelvic bone crushes her deeper and
deeper into the mattress over and over again.
Diane is fighting all this time when everything suddenly
stops. She is left for dead, on the wet, sweat-stained
sheets. Then... it begins again, but this time...
Diane is pulled to her feet. Standing tiptoes above the
pillows she is DRAGGED UP THE WALL AND ONTO THE CEILING. IN
DEFIANCE OF EVERY KNOWN LAW OF PHYSICS.
Diane is dragged across the mandibles of the spider stain and
onto the ceiling. There she is slammed repeatedly, her rear
end pounding the ceiling, her back arched, her head torn back
from her shoulders, held invisibly by the hair.
Without a breather, she is then pulled across and down the
opposite wall. Diane is just as quickly released. She drops
onto the floor. Like jello are her legs. Diane struggles,
crawling off the bed to the door, reaching, straining to open
it.
Mercifully it lets her get out. She BELLOWS her childrens
names.

It is raining and Diane is instantly soaked as she backs up
looking at the house SCREAMING.
DIANE
STEVE! ANYONE!! HELP ME!
Dianes feet lose her footing in the mud and she falls into
the shallow end of the unfinished swimming pool, sliding all
the way down the wet mud to the puddle in the deep end.
THE POOL LIGHTS COME ON. Backlighting the rain and Dianes
flopping actions as she regains her balance is the quagmire.
Then, A GUSHING BUBBLE EXPLODES next to her in the mud. She
stares at it as a second bubble bursts revealing within it,
the leathery face of a corpse, in its burial clothes, rising
like a weed straight out of the gushing mud. Diane SCREAMS
and backs into ANOTHER FACE whos mouth stretches open
revealing tiny wire jaw clamps that make popping SOUNDS like
a jews harp. With a terrible SLURP, the top of a metal
coffin pushes out of the mud, its lid hinged open, tossing
bones and dirt and burial jewelry all over Diane.

blinding light and at the very back, a pale yellow esophagus
that spirals to abysmal depths.

Some sort of seismic upheaval is forcing dead things up from
the ground in even greater numbers. Diane is climbing up the
steep, slick incline toward the metal ladder at the shallow
end. With every couple of steps to safety, she slips back in
the rain, turning back to see the black tie crowd that awaits
her. Diane turns back reaching out her hand to dig in deeper
when...
ANOTHER HAND GRABS HERS.
Diane shrieks and looks into the face of Ben Tuthill from
next door.
TUTHILL
Look at that! Look at that!! Look
in your pool, my God!!
Mrs. Tuthill runs over in her night clothes.
MRS. TUTHILL
Your children. Listen. What sort of
sound is that?
Ethereally, the SCREAMS from Carol Anne and Robbie sound
almost angelic in the rain.
DIANE
I HAVE TO GET THEM OUT!!
She pulls away from Tuthill and races back inside the house.
Ben starts to follow but then Mrs. Tuthill stops him.

Robbie and Carol Anne hold onto their bedposts with all their

DIANE

Robbie reaches out with his one hand and Diane tries to work
her way against the rip to get into position. She looks at
the closet.
THE CLOSET
It sucks harder and Robbie and Carol Annes beds start to
move toward the hot pink opening. Diane lurches the final
inch and grabs Robbies little wrist with both hands.
DIANE
TAKE YOUR SISTERS HAND, ROBBIE.

Robbie reaches for Carol Anne, who reaches out to Robbie.
They are but inches apart.

Pickaxes and shovels weld into the air as hundreds of excavators 
tear at the desert. The camera pans around the area where 
hundreds of Iraqi workmen dig for ancient finds. The caption 
Northern Iraq appears at the bottom of the screen as the digging 
continues. The camera then follows a young boy running bare foot 
over the rocky mounds. He comes to a stop and the camera is 
positioned in between the boys legs looking at and aging man also 
digging. 

YOUNG BOY

They've found something... small pieces.

The boy runs off and the old man pulls himself to his feet to 
follow. The old man walks to the base of the mound where another 
man who looks in command is there to greet him. 

MAN
(In Iraqi language)
Some interesting finds. Lamps, arrow-heads, coins... 

The old man picks up an old pendant and holds it up.

The old man reaches into a hole in the rock, moving and re-
arranging small rocks to see what he can find. He grabs a pickaxe 
and scrapes out a small sculpted piece of rock crushed into 
another. The man takes a dust brush from the man's pocket and 
brushes some dust from the sculpted rock. As the dust is swept we 
see that it is a face. The old man recognises it and looks 
worried. He brakes the sculpted rock away from the ordinary rock 
and takes a good look at it. 

EXTERIOR- IRAQ- MARKET PLACE- DAY 

An Iraqi man walks through the noisy crowd with a tray and up to 
the old man's table. He puts the drink on the table and watches 
as the old man opens a small pendant full of pills and puts one 
into his mouth. The old man is trembling with fear as he downs 
his drink. He puts the glass down and looks at the people around 
him. The man with the tray comes back to the old man's table and 
picks up the glass. 

MAN WITH TRAY
(In Iraqi language)
Something else? 

MERRIN
(In Iraqi language)
No thank you. 

The old man stands up and looks at the bus boy. We cut to a group 
of workers hitting there hammers on an anvil. The old man walks 
in there direction but stops as he sees one of the workers stop 
work to wipe his brow. When the worker makes eye contact with the 
old man we see that the worker has one eye without pigment, 
bleached white as if it has rolled backward. The old man stares 
at him and then walks on. 

INTERIOR-IRAQ-ARCHAEOLOGIST'S OFFICE- DAY 

We see a clocks pendulum swinging, uncovered sculpted rocks of 
all kinds and a man sitting at a desk writing up the report on 
what they found. The old man picks up the pendant he found and 
then the rock head he found and takes a look. 

MERRIN
(In Iraqi language)
Evil against evil. 

The man at the table looks confused. 

MAN
(In Iraqi language)
Father... 

We then see the clocks pendulum stop over the old man's shoulder. 
He turns around and walks toward it. After looking he sits down 
beside it. As he sits the man at the desk stands up. 

MAN
(In Iraqi language)
I wish you didn't have to go. 

MERRIN
(In Iraqi language)
There is something I must do. 

EXTERIOR- IRAQ- OUTSIDE ARCHAEOLOGIST'S OFFICE- DAY 

The two men shake hands and hug. The old man walks away and a 
group of people bow in a row. 

EXTERIOR- IRAQ- MARKET PLACE - ALLEY WAY- DAY 

The old man walks through the noisy, crowded alley way and exits 
through the other side. As he exits he approaches a tunnel, in 
the distance we can here a bell ringing quite fast. As the old 
man gets closer to the tunnel the bell gets louder. When he 
reaches the tunnel a horse and cart flies out in front of him, 
aboard the cart we see a frightened old women. The old man looks 
around as if he was lucky to survive. 

EXTERIOR - IRAQ- NINEVEH- DAY 

The old man arrives back at that dig site in a small jeep. As he 
pulls up two armed guards rush out. When they see who it is the 
old man gives them a wave and they slowly walk back to there 
quarters. The old man walks up the rocky mound and sees a huge 
statue of the demon Pazuzu, which has the head of the small rock 
he earlier found. He climbs to a higher point to get a closer 
look. When he reaches the highest point he looks at the statue 
dead on. He then turns his head as we hear rocks falling and sees 
a guard standing behind him. He then turns again when he hears 
two dogs savagely attacking each other. The noise is something of 
an evil nature. He looks again at the statue and we are then 
presented with a classic stand off side view of the old man and 
the statue as the noises rage on. We then fade to the sun slowly 
setting as the noises lower in volume. 

EXTERIOR- GEORGETOWN- CITY STREETS- EARLY HOURS 

We are transformed from the blazing suns of Iraq to the dusk of 
Washington. As the cross fade is made, the caption GEORGETOWN 
appears at the bottom of the screen. We slowly zoom in on a house 
in the distance. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- CHRIS' BEDROOM- EARLY HOURS 

A small light is switched on by Chris MacNeil, a woman in her mid 
thirties, mother and famous actress. She is clad in her night 
clothes lying in bed, examining lines from a script. She is 
disturbed by a scratching noise that seems to be coming from 
outside her room. She looks over her shoulder to hear for it 
again. When it does happen again she climbs out of bed and puts 
her robe on. She walks toward the bedroom door and exits to the 
hall. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- HALLWAY-EARLY HOURS 

Chris walks through the dark hallway toward her daughters room, 
as she passes the attic hatch she hears the noise again and it 
appears to be coming from the attic. She walks into Regan's (her 
daughter)
room and sees that the window is wide open and she is on top of 
her bed covers. Chris walks in and shivers because of the cold 
night air which enters through the open window. As Chris 
approaches the window another scratch is heard from the attic. 
Chris takes no notice and closes the window. She then walks round 
Regan's bed and puts the covers back over her, she tucks her in 
and strokes her face. 

CHRIS
(Whispering)
I sure do love you. 

Chris kisses Regan and turns away. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- KITCHEN- MORNING 

Chris walks into the kitchen in her robe, with a pen in her mouth 
and her script in her hands. She is greeted by Willie an ageing, 
Swiss house maid. 

CHRIS
Morning. 

WILLIE
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil. 

CHRIS
How are you today? 

WILLIE
Fine thank you. 

CHRIS
That's good. 

Chris puts the script and pen on the table and lifts the coffee 
pot to pour her self a mug. Willie offers to do it for her but 
Chris refuses. 

CHRIS
It's okay I got it, thanks. 

Willie returns to making breakfast as the ageing, Swiss, butler 
Karl walks in. 

KARL
Good morning Madame. 

CHRIS
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you 
better get some traps. 

KARL
Rats? 

CHRIS
Uh huh. 'Fraid so. 

Chris walks to the fridge with her cup of coffee. 

KARL
But it's clean? 

CHRIS
All right then we've got clean rats. 

Chris takes a carton of milk out of the fridge and pours some 
into her coffee. 

KARL
No. No rats. 

CHRIS
I just heard them Karl. 

Karl shrugs his shoulders 

KARL
Maybe plumbing? 

Chris puts the carton of milk away. 

CHRIS
Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps. 

KARL
Yes, I go now. 

CHRIS
Well don't go now Karl the stores aren't open yet. 

Karl picks up a huge jar. And heads out the door. 

KARL
I'll go see. 

WILLIE
(Shouting at Karl)
They're closed! 

EXTERIOR- UNIVERSITY OF GEORGETOWN- FILM SET- DAY 

We are looking at the building of Washington University when 
suddenly we are transported to the film set on campus. Lights, 
camera's, crew members all of the place. A group of crew members 
are surrounding one man, the director Burke Dennings. Burke 
doesn't respond to any of them until he hears a voice calling 
from a trailer. 

CHRIS
(calling)
Burke? oh Burke? 

CREW MEMBER
Is this scene really essential Burke? 

Burke turns to see Chris walking toward him. He walks to her. 

CREW MEMBER
Can you just consider on whether or not we can do without it? 

Chris walks to Burke with her script in hand. 

CHRIS
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense. 

BURKE
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you 
don't want the building torn down. 

CHRIS
C'mon I can read for Christ sake. 

BURKE
Well what's wrong? 

CHRIS
Well why are they tearing the building down? 

BURKE
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe. 

CHRIS
Hiding? 

We see a crowd of people looking on. Standing out is a young, 
dark, handsome Jesuit Priest . 

BURKE
Fucking. 

Chris bursts into laughter and hugs Burke as the crowd including 
the priest burst into laughter.We cut to a crew member with a 
clapper board. 

CREW MEMBER
Scene 39, hotel, take 4! 

As he claps the board we hear the assistant director's voice on a 
mega phone. 

CREW
Okay Action! 

The crowd of movie extras cheer and chant as an actor with a mega 
phone plays his part. Chris is being touched up with make up 
before she makes her appearance. She walks toward the set. 

ACTOR
(with mega-phone)
Has there been enough killing 

After the actor says each line, the crowd cheer. Chris walks into 
the crowd of extras, as we see Burke on the directors chair 
smiling and laughing. Chris reaches the guy with the mega-phone 
and turns on character. She takes the mega-phone and begins. 

CHRIS
(with mega-phone)
Wait a minute, please, hold it! Hey c'mon we're all concerned 
with human rights for god's sake, but the kids who wanna get an 
education have a right too! 

The crowd cheer. 

CHRIS
(with mega-phone)
Can you understand it's against your own principles for gods 
sake. 

The crowd cheer. 

CHRIS
You can't, you can't accomplish anything by sending kids 
out........ 

The crowd cheer cutting her short. We focus on the young priest 
who is walking away from the campus. 

CHRIS
(with mega-phone)
Order! Order! If you wanna effect any change you'll have to do it 
within the system....... 

The crowd cut her short again with an almighty cheer. We move in 
front of the young priest who continues to walk from the set. 

CREW
Okay cut! That's a rap! 

EXTERIOR- GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY- ENTRANCE- DAY 

We see Chris descending a flight of stairs walking toward a car. 

CHRIS
I think I'll walk home tonight Mike. 

MIKE
All right. 

She hands her leather case to him. 

CHRIS
And take that and drop it by my house. 

She walks off and waves goodnight to the crew across the road. As 
she turns the corner and walks down the road, Mike Oldfield's 
Tubular Bells begins to play. She walks through the leaf covered 
street on Halloween and sees a group of kids in costume run past 
her. She carries on walking and sees to nuns waking in the wind, 
with the gowns blowing. She approaches the local chapel and over 
hears a voice. 

KARRAS
There's not a day in my life when I don't feel like a fraud. I 
mean priests, doctor, lawyers I've talked to them all, I don't 
know anyone who hasn't felt that. 

She sees that's it's the young Jesuit who was at the campus 
earlier, and that he is talking to another priest. We don't hear 
the rest of the conversation because of a low flying aeroplane. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- DINNING ROOM- DUSK 

We cut to the dinning room where Chris's house sitter and nanny, 
Sharon is sitting at a type writer eating an apple. 

CHRIS
(calling from outside)
Hello? 

SHARON
In here! 

Chris walks into the dinning room. 

CHRIS
Hi 

SHARON
Hi, how'd your day go? 

CHRIS
Oh not to bad, kinda like the Walt Disney version of the Ho Chi 
Minh story, but other than that it was terrific. 

Chris picks up her mail.

CHRIS

CHRIS

SHARON

CHRIS
No kidding. 

Chris walks toward the cabinet and pours herself a drink. We hear 
a small voice call from the hall. 

REGAN
Hi mom. 

Regan runs in and hugs and kisses Chris. 

CHRIS
What did you do today? 

REGAN
Um........Stuff. 

CHRIS
What kind of stuff? 

REGAN
Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a 
picnic down by the river. 

Chris sits down. 

REGAN
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this 
beautiful grey horse. (to Sharon)
Wasn't it pretty? 

CHRIS
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding? 

REGAN
Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the 
guy let me ride it all around. 

CHRIS
Your kidding? 

SHARON
Yeah for about half an hour. 

REGAN
It was so nice, oh I loved it. Oh mom can't we get a horse? 

CHRIS
Well, not while we're in Washington. 

REGAN
Oh............ 

CHRIS
We'll see when we get home okay. 

REGAN
When can I have one? 

CHRIS
We'll see Regan. (to Sharon)
Now about those party invitations....... 

Regan opens the jar of candy for the trick or treaters and takes 
some candy. Regan runs of and Chris chases her. 

CHRIS
Regan come back here. 

Chris catches Regan and wrestle her to the floor. Regan is 
giggling constantly. 

CHRIS
All right give it up, give it up, now! You'll be sorry. 

INTERIOR- SUBWAY- DAY 

We cut to a train screaming through a subway station. When the 
train goes past we see the young Jesuit priest standing at the 
platform. As things get quiet he hears and Irish voice behind 
him. 

HOMELESS GUY
Fa-dah! Can you help an old altar boy? I'm a Cat-lick! 

A train goes past illuminating the homeless guys face. The young 
priest just walks on. 

EXTERIOR- NEW YORK STREET- DAY 

The young priest walks down a garbage infested, New York city 
street. Kids making noise and jumping on cars are the only source 
of noise. The young priest walks up a porchway and enters a 
building. 

INTERIOR- KARRAS' MOTHER'S FLAT- HALLWAY 

The young priest enters the apartment, turns on the light and 
takes off his jacket, and his collar. 

KARRAS
Momma? 

He walks into the living room where an old woman sits listening 
to a radio. 

KARRAS
Momma? 

He leans over the chair. 

KARRAS
Momma? 

The old woman stands up with joy. 

MRS.KARRAS
Dimmy! Damien! 

They greet each other in Greek as Mrs. Karras hugs him. 

MRS. KARRAS
I'm so happy to see you. 

KARRAS
You look good. 

MRS.KARRAS
I'm all right. 

KARRAS
How's your leg? 

MRS. KARRAS
How about you Dimmy? Are you all right? 

KARRAS
I'm fine mom, I'm fine. 

We cut to Karras eating his supper and his mom rocking in her 
chair with the radio on still playing in the background. 

MRS.KARRAS
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me. 

KARRAS
Oh really, when? 

MRS.KARRAS
Last month. 

We now cut to Karras putting a bandage around his mothers leg. 

KARRAS
Is that too tight? 

MRS.KARRAS
No. 

KARRAS
Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down 
those stairs you have to give it rest. 

MRS.KARRAS
Okay 

KARRAS
Momma I can take you somewhere to a place where you wouldn't be 
alone. There'd be people around, you know you won't have to sit 
here listening to the radio. 

Mrs. Karras responds by shouting in Greek. 

MRS.KARRAS
You understand me, This is my house, and I'm not going no place. 

Damien stands up and lights a cigarette. 

MRS.KARRAS
Dimmy, you worry for something? 

KARRAS
No momma. 

MRS.KARRAS
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter? 

KARRAS
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am. 

We cut to the bedroom light going out, with Damien walking out 
back in uniform. He put's some money on the table and turns up 
the radio so that his leaving doesn't wake his mother. He kisses 
her and walks out. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- BASEMENT- NIGHT 

Regan is in the basement making a model. Chris is decending the 
steps. 

REGAN

She holds up a clay model of an orange bird. 

Chris and Regan both laugh. 

CHRIS
Oh look at that. 

REGAN
You like it? 

CHRIS
Oh it's so funny. 

Chris takes it and put's it on a shelf. 

CHRIS
I better put him over here to dry though. He's still wet. 

Regan walks over to the ping pong table and bounces a ping pong 
ball. By the shelf Chris picks up an ouiji board. 

CHRIS
Hey, where'd this come from? 

REGAN
I found it. 

CHRIS
Where? 

REGAN
The closet 

Chris walks toward the ping pong table with the ouiji board in 
hand. 

CHRIS
You've been playing with it? 

REGAN
Yeah. 

CHRIS
You know how? 

REGAN

Regan places the board down on the table. Chris drags a chair 
over and sits down. 

CHRIS
Wait a minute you need two. 

REGAN
No you don't. I do it all the time. 

CHRIS
Oh yeah, well let's both play. 

The pointer pulls itself away from Chris. 

CHRIS
You really don't want me to play huh? 

REGAN
No I do, Captain Howdy said no. 

CHRIS

REGAN
Captain Howdy. 

CHRIS

CHRIS
Oh, Captain Howdy.... 

REGAN
He's nice. 

CHRIS
Oh I bet he is. 

REGAN

Regan places the magnifier on the board and closes her eyes. 

REGAN
Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? 
Captain Howdy that isn't very nice. 

CHRIS
Well, maybe he's sleeping. 

REGAN
You think? 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- REGAN'S BEDROOM- NIGHT 

Regan is lying in bed looking at a magazine which has Chris and 
Regan on the cover. Chris is tucking Regan in. 

CHRIS
Regan, why are you reading that? 

REGAN
Cause I like it. 

CHRIS
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature. 

REGAN
I wouldn't talk. 

CHRIS
Oh you wouldn't talk, well I didn't have my make up man there. 

Chris sits down on Regan's bed leaning over her. 

CHRIS
Just gotta get this eye-lash off of you. 

Chris tries to get an eye lash from Regan's eye lid. 

CHRIS
No I didn't get it. 

Chris tries again and gets it. 

CHRIS

INTERIOR- UNIVERSITY OF GEORGETOWN- CAMPUS BAR- NIGHT 

Damien is walking away from the bar with two beers. He sits at a 
table and puts one beer in front of the president of the 
university. Loud trendy music is playing in the background and 
the bar is full of students. 

KARRAS
It's my mother Tom. She's alone I never should have left her. At 
least in New York I'd be nearer, I'd be closer. 

PRESIDENT

EXTERIOR-MACNEIL HOUSE- STREET- DAY 

We see leaves blow as we cut to a front shot of the house. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- REGAN'S BEDROOM- DAY 

We start with a close up of Chris on the phone and slowly zoom 
out to see Regan over hearing the phone call. 

CHRIS
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be 
kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes. (to Sharon)
Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his 
daughter on her birthday for christ sake. 

SHARON

CHRIS
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit! 

SHARON

Yes. No, Operator don't tell me there's no answer, it's the Hotel 
Excelcia in Rome would you try it again please and let it ring. 
Hello? Operator you've given me the number four times. What did 
you do, take an iliteracey test to get that job for Christ sake. 
(shouting)
No don't tell me to be calm god damn it! I've been on this 
fucking line for twenty minutes. 

Regan sits on her bed and takes off her shoes. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- CHRIS' BEDROOM- NIGHT 

It's dark and we see Chris a sleep in her bed. The silence is 
broken by the phone ringing. She clubs her hand on the reciever 
and picks it up. She holds it to her head. 

CHRIS
Yeah? You're kidding me? I thought I just went to bed. Uh huh. 
What are we doing scene sixty one? (switches the light on)
Okay, just remind him about that blue belt huh? 

She puts the phone down and rolls over to find Regan laying next 
to her. 

CHRIS
What are you doing here? 

REGAN
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep. 

CHRIS
Oh, honey. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- HALLWAY- NIGHT 

We cut to a close up of the attic outside Chris' room. We then 
see Chris exit her room tying the cord on her robe. She walks 
toward the attic and looks as a crashing noise comes from the 
attic. She walks round to the entrance of the attic and pulls the 
steps down with a pole. She pushes the light switch but nothing 
happens, so she lights a candle and climbs the steps as Regan 
looks on from Chris' bed. When Chris reaches the attic, she walks 
around in the darkness, knocking things over and looking for what 
is making the crash. She looks for the rat traps to see if any 
rats have been caught but all of them remain in tact with the 
lumps of cheese still in place. Chris hears the crash again and 
follows the sound, as she walks through the junk her candle blows 
up ans she hears a voice. 

Chris turns around to see Karl standing on the steps of the 
entrance shining a flash-light toward her. 

KARL
There is nothing. 

CHRIS
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that. 

KARL
Very sorry, but you see, no rats! 

CHRIS
No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific. 

EXTERIOR- UNIVERSTIY OF WASHINGTON- DAHLGREN CHAPEL- DAY 

We cut to an elderly bishop, walking across the campus carrying 
two large bouquet flower pots. He walks up to the entrance of the 
chapel and enters. 

INTERIOR- UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON- DAHLGREN CHAPEL- DAY 

The bishop walks into the chapel, and walks to the aisle. When he 
reaches the aisle he bows and then approaches the altar. He 
places one of the boucuets in front of one statue, but as he 
turns to the camera he walks very slowly and we see him in shock 
as he gasps. We cut to what he has seen. It's the statue of the 
Virgin Mary, which has been horribly desecrated, by being given a 
clay penis and pointing clay breasts. 

INTERIOR- BELLEVUE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL- HALLYWAY- DAY 

We cut to Karras hurridly walking down a corridor being followed 
by his Uncle. 

UNCLE
The edima affected her brain, you understand Dimmy? She don't let 
no doctor come near her. She was all the time screaming, even 
talking to the radio. 

KARRAS
You should have called me the minute it happened. 

UNCLE
Listen, regular hospital not going to put up with her Dimmy, 
understand? So we give her a shot and bring her here, till the 
doctors fix up her leg, then we take her out Dimmy, two or three 
months and she's out good as new. 

They approach an office and Karras' Uncle walks in to speak to 
the nurse. 

UNCLE
Miss? 

NURSE
Yes? 

UNCLE
We want to see Mrs. Karras. 

NURSE
Do you have an appointment? 

UNCLE
Yes 

NURSE
Are you a relative? 

UNCLE
Yes I am her brother, he's the son 

NURSE
Just a minute. 

The grabs a set of keys and writes something in a note book. We 
then cut to Damien staring in the window of the ward. He's see's 
all sorts of people, all with mental problems. 

UNCLE
You know it's funny. If you wasn't a priest you'd be famous 
psychiatrist now on Park Avenue, your mother she'd be living in a 
penthouse instead of here. 

The nurse unlocks the door and opens it. Damien looks at his 
Uncle. 

UNCLE
You go in Dimmy. I wait for you outside. 

Karras walks in and leaves his Uncle behind. 

NURSE
You'll find Mrs. Karras on the last bed on the left hand side. 

As Damien enters, a few of the patients rush toward him. Two of 
them grab him, as the nurse tries to get them away. Damien barges 
them out of his way only to have another patient rush into him 
and take his collar. The nurse takes her away as bed bound 
patients look on with arms out stretched. Damien approaches his 
mothers bed. 

KARRAS
Momma? It's Dimmy momma. 

Mrs. Karras slowly turns her eyes to him. 

MRS. KARRAS
Dimmy. Why they did this to me Dimmy? Why? 

Damien rushes to comfort his mother. 

KARRAS
Momma, I'm gonna take you outta here momma. 

Mrs. Karras struggles to turn away from him. 

KARRAS
Momma I'm goona take you home. 

Mrs. Karras shouts at him in Greek as Damien tries to comfort 
her. 

KARRAS
Momma, everything's gonna be alright momma, I'm gonna take you 
home! 

EXTERIOR- NEW YORK- CITY STREET- DAY 

We cut to Damien talking to his Uncle face to face. 

KARRAS
Couldn't you have put her some place else? 

UNCLE
Like what? Private hospital? Who got the money for that Dimmy? 
You? 

INTERIOR- UNIVERSITY OF GEORGETOWN- BOXING GYM- DAY 

We cut Damien taking his frustration out on a punch bag. He 
throws a few hard punches before stopping for breath. 

INTERIOR- DR. KLEIN'S EXAMINING ROOM- DAY 

Brief montage of shots. 

Klein administering a physical to Regan. Including opthalmoscope, 
tuning fork and simple coordination tests. Also blood sample in 
centrifograph, and urine sampl under microscope. Final shot has a 
nurse with her back against the examining table, her expression 
partly puzzled, partly disturbed as she observes Regan, who is in 
her slip and in constant motion; stepping, twirling, touching, 
making nervous movements whilst aimlessly humming. Klein is not 
present. 

INTERIOR- DR. KLEIN'S OFFICE- DAY 

Chris is seated on the edge of a chair. Klein is behind his desk, 
writing a prescription. 

DR. KLEIN
A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know 
yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl 
adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the 
temper; her performance in math. 

CHRIS
Why the math? 

DR. KLEIN
It affects concentration. 

Here tears the prescription away from the pad. 

DR. KLEIN
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day. 

CHRIS
What is it? A tranquilizer? 

DR. KLEIN
A stimulant. 

CHRIS
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now! 

DR. KLEIN
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause 
of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to 
work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or 
why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction 
to depression- but that's out of my field. 

CHRIS
Depression? 

DR. KLEIN
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce. 

CHRIS
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist? 

DR. KLEIN
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think 
that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks. 

CHRIS
And those lies she's been telling? 

DR. KLEIN
Lies? 

CHRIS
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed 
shakes and stuff. 

DR. KLEIN
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities? 

CHRIS
Never. 

DR. KLEIN
Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- 
uncharacter- 

CHRIS
Wait a minute. What are you talking about? 

DR. KLEIN
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, 
Mrs. MacNeil. 

CHRIS
You're kidding! Like what? 

DR. KLEIN
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive. 

CHRIS
Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance! 

Klein shrugs. No reply. 

CHRIS
Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, 
Doctor. 

DR. KLEIN
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my 
fingers away from her goddam cunt. 

CHRIS
(shocked, laughing)
She used those words? 

DR. KLEIN
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what 
she was saying. 

CHRIS
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-? 

DR. KLEIN
The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. 
Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry. 

EXTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- PROSPECT STREET- NIGHT 

We see the house is lit up as there's a party going on inside. A 
car pulls up before we enter. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- NIGHT 

We see lots of people enjoying them selves, talking, laughing, 
eating. Music playing and people having a good time. We see Burke 
sitting on a couch with two people beside him, he's drunk and is 
sat twirling his finger around in his drink. 

BURKE
There seems to be an alien pubic hair in my Gin. 

ASTRONAUT
I beg your pardon? 

BURKE
Never seen it before in my life. Have you? 

We see more people having fun, Regan laughing and we then cut to 
Father Dyer, a young priest who is talking to the same guy Burke 
was. 

ASTRONAUT
Well actually Father, we're quite comfortable up there, at least 
compared to the Gemini and Mercury program. So they were tight 
for space, see we've got about two-hundred and ten cubic feet so 
we can move around. 

FATHER DYER
Listen, if you ever go up there again will you take me along? 

ASTRONAUT
(laughs)
What for? 

FATHER DYER
First missionary on mars. 

We then cut to Burke who is approaching Karl, who is carrying a 
tray of drinks. 

BURKE
Tell me, was it public relations you done for the Gestapo or 
community relations? 

KARL
I'm Swiss. 

BURKE
Yes of course. Never went bowling with Goebbels either I suppose 
ah? 

Karl walks away. 

BURKE
Nazi bastard. 

We cut to Chris who is talking to Father Dyer. 

CHRIS
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a 
red brick wing? 

FATHER DYER
St. Mike's. 

CHRIS
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's 
there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense 
looking? 

FATHER DYER
Damien Karras. 

CHRIS
Karras. 

FATHER DYER
That's his office back of St. Mike's. He's our psychiatric 
counsellor. He had a pretty rough knock last night poor guy, his 
mother passed away. She was living by herself and I guess she was 
dead a couple of days before they found her. 

We cut to the kitchen where Burke is once again taunting Karl. 

BURKE
Cunting Hun! Bloody damn butchering Nazi pig! 

Karl lunges at Burke and grabs him by the throat. 

KARL
Bastard! I will kill you. 

CHRIS
Karl!! 

Chris, Sharon and Willie pull Karl away from Burke. Willie takes 
him into another room. 

KARL
You fiend! 

Burke just laughs and claps his hands. 

BURKE
What's for dessert? 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- REGAN'S BEDROOM-NIGHT 

We see Regan is tucked up in bed with her eyes closed. Chris 
pulls the covers up to her shoulders. 

CHRIS
Are you asleep? 

There is no reply so Chris kisses her and exits. As Chris 
disappears Regan's eyes open suddenly. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- NIGHT 

We cut to Chris and Sharon who are trying to help (a very drunk)
Burke to the front door. Burke is trying to mumble a song. Sharon 
opens the front door for him. 

CHRIS
Listen Burke, your car is on the curbe. Luis is waiting... 

Burke hugs her. Chris looks confused and hugs him back. Burke 
pulls away and points his finger as if he wants to say something, 
but he forgets. 

CHRIS
What honey? 

BURKE
Fuck it. 

Burke walks off and Chris and Sharon close the door and return to 
the party. Father Dyer is sitting at the piano and everyone is 
singing songs. 

FATHER DYER
Hi Chris. Great party. 

CHRIS
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going. 

FATHER DYER
Listen, I don't need any encouragement, but my idea of heaven is 
a solid white night club, with me as the head liner, for all 
eternity and they love me. 

Everyone laughs. Father Dyer starts to play a song and everyone 
sings along. 

EVERYONE
"Down on the east side of Toyd..." 

FATHER DYER
Toyd, Toyd. 

EVERYONE
"Toyd, that's my home, sweet home. Can we both think it's..." 

Regan appears in view and Father Dyer notices her first. 

FATHER DYER
Hey I, I think we have a guest. 

Everyone turns to Regan as she stands and stares at the astronaut 
guy. 

REGAN
Your gonna die up there. 

The guy looks puzzled and Regan begins to urinate on the floor. 

CHRIS
Regan, my God honey. (to the guests)
I'm sorry, she's been sick. She didn't know what she was saying. 

PART GUY1
That's all right. 

CHRIS
(to Regan)
C'mon. 

Chris takes Regan out. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- REGAN'S BATHROOM- NIGHT 

Regan is in the bath tub, hunched forward, staring infront of 
her. Chris has a sponge and is rinsing water on Regan's back. 

CHRIS
What made you say that Regan? Do you know sweetheart? 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- REGAN'S BEDROOM-NIGHT 

Chris tucks Regan in and walks to the door. 

REGAN
Mother? What's wrong with me? 

Chris walks back to her. 

CHRIS
It's just like the doctor said, it's nerves and that's all. Okay, 
you just take your pills and you'll be fine really. Okay? 

Regan nods and Chris exits the room. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- HALLWAY- NIGHT 

Chris walks to the stairs where we see Willie, down stairs, 
cleaning up Regan's mess. 

CHRIS
Is it coming out Willie? 

WILLIE
Yes, I think so. 

All of a sudden we here Regan screaming along with a constant 
crashing sound. Chris rushes to Regan's room. 

REGAN
Mother! Mother! Mother!!!!! Mother help! 

Chris opens the door and gasps in shock. We then see Regan on her 
bed, but the bed is thumping and shaking ferociously. 

CHRIS
Oh my God! 

REGAN
Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!! 

Chris jumps on the bed to comfort Regan and they both sit 
screaming as the bed continues to rapidly jump around. 

INTERIOR- UNIVERSITY OF GEORGETOWN- HALLWAY- NIGHT 

Father Dyer is walking down the long corridor to Damien's room. 
He reaches the room, knocks ad then enters. 

KARRAS
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box? 

FATHER DYER
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty. 

KARRAS
Where'd you get it then? 

FATHER DYER
I stole it. 

KARRAS
I believe you. 

FATHER DYER
College president shouldn't drink. Tends to set a bad example, I 
figure I saved them from a big temptation. 

KARRAS
Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've 
been there. 

FATHER DYER
There was nothing you could do. Lye down. C'mon. 

Father Dyer helps Damien onto his bed, takes his cigarette and 
takes his shoes off. 

FATHER DYER
Think you can sleep? 

KARRAS
Are you gonna steal my shoes now? 

FATHER DYER
No, I tell fortunes by reading the crease, now shut up and go to 
sleep. 

Damien grabs Father Dyer's arm but slowly let's go. Father Dyer 
turns the light out and heads for the door. 

FATHER DYER
Goodnight Dims. 

KARRAS
Stealing is a sin. 

Dyer exists. We slowly zoom in on Damien while he's asleep. He 
starts to dream and we see the images that come into his head. 
There is falling medallion, a swing pendulum in a clock and a 
running dog. He then sees his mother ascending a subway tunnel to 
the street, Karras is on the other side of the street and 
although there is no sound, we can see that Damien is calling 
"Momma" and Mrs. Karras is calling "Damien". A white demonic face 
flashes a split second as Karras starts to run across the street 
to his mother, but we see her once again descend to the subway. 
We see the falling medallion again and as it hits the floor, the 
silence is broken by Regan's screamng. 

INTERIOR- HOSPITAL- DR. KLEIN'S OFFICE- DAY 

REGAN
I don't want it. 

CHRIS
Honey it's to help you. 

We can see Dr. Klein preparing an injection. 

REGAN
I don't want it, I don't want it. 

Dr. Klein injects the needle into Regan's arm. She spits at him. 

REGAN
You fucking bastard!! 

INTERIOR- UNIVERSITY OF GEORGETOWN- CHAPEL- DAY 

Karras is doing a church service in the chapel. 

KARRAS
(whisper)
Remember O Lord, Thy servant, Mary Karras... who has gone before 
us with the sign of faith, and sleeps the sleep of peace. (to the 
attendants)
Lord I am not worthy to receive you, but only say the words and I 
shall be healed. May the body of Christ bring me ever lasting 
life. 

INTERIOR- HOSPITAL- CORRIDOR- DAY 

Chris is waiting outside Dr. Klein's office. Dr.Klein emerges 
from his room. 

DR. KLEIN
Well, It's a symptom of a type of desturbance in the chemico-
electrical activity of the brain. In the case of your daughter in 
the temperal lobe, up here in the lateral part of the brain. It's 
rare, but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just 
before a convulsion. 

CHRIS
Convulsion? 

DR. KLEIN
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms. 

CHRIS
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was 
thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, 
with me on it! 

DR. KLEIN
Mrs. MacNeil the problem with your daughter is not her bed, it's 
her brain. 

They both walk into Klein's office. 

INTERIOR- HOSPITAL- DR. KLEIN'S OFFICE- DAY 

CHRIS
So, what causes this? 

DR. KLEIN
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure 
disorder. 

CHRIS
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality 
could change. 

DR. KLEIN
The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even 
weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal 
behaviour. 

CHRIS
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good. 

DR. KLEIN
Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All 
we have to do is remove the scar. 

INTERIOR- HOSPITAL- OPERATING THEATRE- DAY 

We see Regan being wheeled on a bed to the operating bench. The 
place the bed next to the bench and pull the bars down. 

MALE NURSE
Regan, could you sit up and scoot over here? 

Regan does so and she lays back onto the operating bench. The 
male nurse pushes a button and the bench begins to move forward. 

MALE NURSE
Regan, I'm just gonna move you down to the table okay? 

The bench comes to a halt. 

MALE NURSE
Just for a short time. 

Both nurses, male and female, loosen Regans gown around the neck 
to prep her for the doctor. They place monitors on her arms. 

MALE NURSE
Very sticky. 

The doctor approaches Regan with a pot of betadine and puts a 
sponge into the pot. 

DOCTOR
Now Regan you're going to feel something, a little bit cold and 
wet. 

He dabs the sponge onto her neck making it a light brown colour. 
The doctor then picks up a hypodermic needle and moves toward 
her. We can see Chris and Dr. Klein in the viewing room. 

DOCTOR
Okay, now you're gonna feel a little stick here. Don't move. 

The doctor injects the needle into Regan's neck. 

DOCTOR
Good. 

He then picks up a a needle head without the syringe, and moves 
toward her. 

DOCTOR
Okay, you're gonna feel some pressure here, now don't move. 

The doctor places the needle into the hole he made with the 
syringe. Regan is quietly yelping in pain, and Chris is in pain 
watching her daughter suffer. The doctor takes the tiny cap from 
the needle, Regan's clothing is squirted with blood and places a 
tube into the needle's head. We see the blood rush from Regan's 
neck through the tube. The male nurse then tapes Regan's chin 
down to prevent her from moving. The nurses then move in a huge 
machine, two pieces either side of Regan's head and a piece 
above. The lights fade out in the theatre and all we can see is 
Regan's face illuminated by this huge machince above her. 

DOCTOR
Hook up. 

We see a finger flip a switch and the machine comes to life. A 
guy in the view room pushes another button and the machine lets 
off several loud bangs. In the theatre we can see Regan crying. 

INTERIOR- HOSPITAL- X-RAY ROOM- DAY 

We see an X-ray slide of Regan's skull appear on an illuminated 
screen. Then several more appear one after the other. We see Dr. 
Tanney is controlling the slides as he examines them, Dr. Klein 
is with him. 

DR. TANNEY
There's nothing there. No vascular displacement at all. You want 
me to run another series? 

DR. KLEIN
I don't think so. I'd like you to see her again. 

A nurse enters the room. 

NURSE
Excuse me Doctor. Chris MacNeil is on the phone, she says it's 
urgent. 

DR. KlEIN
Got some time? 

DR. TANNEY
Of course. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE-DAY 

We hear the doorbell ring and Sharon racing down the stairs to 
answer it, but no sound could block out Regan's screaming from up 
stairs. Sharon opens the door. 

SHARON
Dr. Klein? 

DR. KLEIN
Yes I'm Dr. Klein, this is Dr. Tanney. 

DR. TANNEY
How do you do? 

SHARON
Hi Sharon, things have gotten worse since we called you, I better 
take you up stairs. 

DR. KLEIN
Is she having spasms again? 

SHARON
Yes but they've gotten violent. 

DR. KLEIN
Did you give her the medication she needed? 

SHARON
Yes. 

DR. TANNEY
What was that? 

DR. KLEIN
Thorazine. Before that it was Ritalin. 

They approach Regan's door. Sharon knocks. 

SHARON
Chris, Doctors. 

Chris opens the door. 

DR. KLEIN
Mrs. MacNeil, this is Doctor Tanney. 

We see Regan is laying on her bed, thrashing her torso against 
the mattress and up again. 

REGAN
Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop! It's burning, it's 
burning please mother! 

CHRIS
So something please Doctor, Help her! 

REGAN
Make it stop,it really hurts! Mother! Make it... 

Regan suddenly growls, her eyes roll back and her throat swells 
abnormally. She stands up on the bed. 

DR. KLEIN
Alright then Regan, let's see... 

Regan back hands Dr. Klein and he flies backward. 

CHRIS
Oh Regan! 

REGAN/DEMON
Keep away! The sow is mine! 

She pulls up her dress and mimes masturbation. 

REGAN/DEMON
Fuck me ! Fuck Me! Fuck me! 

She falls back and starts to scream again. 

DR. KLEIN
Get my bag! 

Sharon grabs Dr. Klein's bag and Karl slaps Regan to stop her 
from screaming. Chris screams with horror in reaction to what 
she's just seen. Karl and Dr. Tanney hold Regan down as Dr. Klein 
prepares a syringe to knock her out. 

REGAN
Stay away from me! Stay away! Mother! 

DR. KLEIN
Hold her steady, Hold her tight! 

Dr. Klein injects the needle and Sharon takes Chris outside. When 
the door is closed, Regan's screaming becomes dead silence. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY- DAY 

Chris and Sharon sit in the hallway with their heads in hands. 
Klein and Tanney exit Regan's room and approach them. Chris 
stands. 

DR. KLEIN
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow. 

CHRIS
What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like 
that? 

DR. TANNEY
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated 
motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her 
child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the 
wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same 
thing here. Same principle, I mean. 

CHRIS
So what's wrong with her? 

DR. KLEIN
We still think the temporal lobe... 

CHRIS
Oh. What are you talking about for Christ sake! Did you see her 
or not? She's acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or 
a split personality or... 

DR. TANNEY
There haven't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so-
called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I know the temptation 
is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would 
exhaust the somatic possibilities first. 

CHRIS
So what's next? 

DR. TANNEY
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It 
will involve another spinal. 

CHRIS
Oh, Christ. 

DR. TANNEY
What we missed in the EEG and the arteriogram could conceivably 
turn up there. At the least, it would eliminate certain other 
possibilities. 

INTERIOR- MEDICAL LABORATORY- DAY 

We see a piece of heavy machinery swivelling above the camera. We 
then see Regan strapped to a table, hooked up to the machine. 
She's yelping in pain. 

INTERIOR- DR. KLEIN'S OFFICE-DAY 

Dr. Klein is looking over the lab reports and seems baffled. 

DR. KLEIN
Dr. Tanney says the X-rays are negative. In other words normal. 

Chris sighs. 

DR. KLEIN
Do you keep any drugs in your house? 

CHRIS
No. Of course not, nothing like that. 

DR. KLEIN
Are you sure? 

CHRIS
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke 
grass. 

DR. KLEIN
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean. 

CHRIS
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was 
going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished 
school here. Why d'you ask? 

DR. KLEIN
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.

INTERIOR- CHRIS' CAR- NIGHT 

Angle from driver's seat- 'M' Street and 36th. Through the 
windshield, dead ahead, a crowd has gathered by the base of the 
steep steps beside the house, and an ambulance is pulling out 
into traffic. Police car lights are flashing. As Chris rounds off 
the bridge on to Prospect street, the ambulance pulls out and 
then gets ahead of her, siren wailing. We follow the ambulance 
for two beats. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- KITCHEN- NIGHT 

The lights are blinking on and off and the phone is ringing. 
Chris enters the kitchen and answers the phone. 

CHRIS
(down the phone)
Hello? 

But there is no answer. She puts the phone down and wanders 
further into the kitchen. The lights are still blinking. 

CHRIS
Sharon? 

The lights come back on. 

CHRIS
Shar? 

Still no response. Chris exits to the lounge. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- SECOND FLOOR HALL- NIGHT 

As Chris reaches the landing she halts, her eyes warily scanning 
around, then she continues down the hall toward us, and opens the 
door to Regan's bedroom. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- REGAN'S BEDROOM- NIGHT 

There is silence as Chris stands by the door a moment. Chris hugs 
herself, shivering from the cold. Regan is sound asleep and 
uncovered from the bed sheets. Chris sees that the window is wide 
open. 

CHRIS
(whisper)
Shit. 

Chris moves to the window and closes it, but still feels cold. 
She walks to Regan and pulls the covers back over her. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- SECOND FLOOR HALL- NIGHT 

As Chris exits and softly closes Regan's door. She walks toward 
the stairs when we hear the front door close, followed by a call. 

SHARON
(downstairs)
Sharon! 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- FOYER- NIGHT 

Sharon enters with a brown pharmacy bag. 

CHRIS
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her 
self! What are you kidding her window's wide open... 

SHARON
What didn't he tell you? 

CHRIS
Didn't who tell me? 

SHARON
Burke. 

CHRIS
What's Burke got to do with it? 

SHARON
Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her 
and... Oh, I should of known better. 

CHRIS
Yeah, well I guess you should've. 

Chris hangs up her jacket and the doorbell rings. 

SHARON
What did the doctor say? 

CHRIS
We have to start looking for a shrink. 

She opens the door. It's the assistant director. 

CHRIS
Hi Chuck, c'mon in. 

CHUCK
I suppose you've heard. 

CHRIS
Heard what? 

Chuck takes his hat off and holds it to his chest. 

CHUCK
You haven't heard. 

Chris turns around to face him and looks baffled. 

CHUCK
Burke's dead. (Short pause)
He must of been drunk. He fell down from the top of the steps 
right outside, by the time he hit 'M' Street he'd broken his 
neck. 

Chris puts her hands to her mouth. 

CHRIS
Oh God! 

Chris breaks into tears and press up against the wall. Chuck 
gently hugs her from behind. 

CHUCK
Yeah, I know. 

Chuck backs away. 

CHUCK
I'll see you later. 

Chuck exits. 

CHRIS
Oh Burke! Poor Burke! 

SHARON
I can't believe it. 

Chris lowers her brow into her hand, leaning against the door. 
She shakes her head, exhales. 

CHRIS
I guess everything- 

She breaks off, staring with horror at something descending the 
stairs. It's Regan on all fours. She's gliding, spiderlike, 
noiselessly and swiftly, down the staircase. She halts directly 
at the bottom. Staring at Sharon. Sharon is shocked and eyes 
fixed on Regan. Regan's tongue begins to flicker rapidly in and 
out of her mouth. She crawls very speedly toward Sharon with her 
tongue sticking out. Sharon screams and runs toward the door, 
Chris falls on Regan trying to hold her back. 

CHRIS
Call the doctor! 

We fade to black 

PSYCHIATRIST
Now when I touch your forehead, open your eyes. 

We fade back with a full face shot of Regan, with two fingers 
wiping her brow. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- CHRIS' BEDROOM- DAY 

We stay fixed on Regan's full mug shot. 

PSYCHIATRIST
Are you comfortable Regan? 

REGAN
Yes. 

PSYCHIATRIST
How old are you? 

REGAN
Twelve. 

PSYCHIATRIST
Is there someone inside you? 

REGAN
Sometimes. 

PSYCHIATRIST
Who is it? 

REGAN
I don't know. 

PSYCHIATRIST
Is it Captain Howdy? 

REGAN
I don't know. 

PSYCHIATRIST
If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer? 

We now get a view of the whole room. Chris and Dr. Klein are also 
present. 

REGAN
No. 

PSYCHIATRIST
Why not? 

REGAN
I'm afraid. 

PSYCHIATRIST
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to 
leave you? 

REGAN
Yes. 

We get a close up of the psychiatrist. 

PSYCHIATRIST
I'm talking to the person inside of Regan now. If you are there 
you too are hypnotised and must answer all my questions. Come 
forward answer me now. 

A framed picture of Regan drops to the floor. We switch to a 
close up of Regan who is growling like some kind of animal. Chris 
and Dr. Klein both cover there nose and mouth as if a foul stench 
is circulating the room. 

PSYCHIATRIST
Are you the person inside of Regan? 

Regan's eyes are fixed on the psychiatrist. Her arm is propped up 
like a cobra ready to strike. 

PSYCHIATRIST
Who are you? 

Regan's hand drops and grips the psychiatrists scrotum, squeezing 
like a vice. The psychiatrist screams in pain. 

PSYCHIATRIST
ARGHHHH Harold!!! Help me! 

Dr. Klein grabs Regan and pulls her away. Regan falls back and 
screams extremely loud. 

EXTERIOR- RUNNING TRACK- GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY- DAY 

In training gear, Karras is running laps. Seated on a bench at 
the edge of the track, watching Karras, Lt. Kinderman. Karras 
seems curious, if not disturbed, by Kinderman's presence. When 
Karras stops, panting, Kinderman rises and moves toward him. 

KINDERMAN
Father Karras? 

Karras picks up his towel and wipes his brow. 

KARRAS
Have we met? 

KINDERMAN
No we haven't met, but they said I could tell; that you looked 
like a boxer. 

Kinderman shows his badge. 

KINDERMAN
William F. Kinderman. Homicide. 

KARRAS
What's this about? 

KINDERMAN
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body 
and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father? 

KARRAS
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman? 

KINDERMAN
Always. 

Karras walks away toward the campus. 

KINDERMAN
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings? 

KARRAS
I've seen him. 

KINDERMAN
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died? 

KARRAS
Only what I read in the papers. 

KINDERMAN
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of 
witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting. 

KARRAS
I once did a paper on it 

KINDERMAN
Really? 

KARRAS
From the psychiatric end. 

KINDERMAN
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the churchyou think 
they have anything to do with witchcraft? 

KARRAS
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe. 

KINDERMAN
And Dennings, you read how he died? 

KARRAS
Yeah, a fall. 

KINDERMAN
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke 
Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps 
leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. 
Facing backwards. 

KARRAS
Couldn't it of happened on the fall. 

KINDERMAN
It's possible. Possible however 

KARRAS
Unlikely. 

KINDERMAN
Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder 
and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church. 

KARRAS
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same? 

KINDERMAN
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, 
some unconscious rebellion, perhaps. 

KARRAS
Sick priest, is that it? 

KINDERMAN
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the 
campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at 
the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know 
that. 

KARRAS
I don't know anyone who fits the description. 

KINDERMAN
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh? 

KARRAS
No I probably wouldn't. 

KINDERMAN
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny 
California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he 
knew about a patient. 

KARRAS
Is that a threat? 

KINDERMAN
No, I mentioned it only in passing. 

KARRAS
Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the 
judge that it was a matter of confession. 

Karras walks off toward his dormitory and Kinderman chases him. 

KINDERMAN
Hey, Father? You like movies? 

KARRAS
Very much. 

KINDERMAN
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets 
tired and never likes to go. 

KARRAS
That's to bad. 

KINDERMAN
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss 
the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The 
Crest. It's Othello. 

KARRAS
Who's in it? 

KINDERMAN
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho 
Marx. You're happy? 

KARRAS
I've seen it. 

KINDERMAN
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill? 

KARRAS
Come on! 

KINDERMAN
Answer the question, Father Paranoia. 

KARRAS
Alright. You know who I think really did it? 

KINDERMAN
Who? 

KARRAS
The Dominicans. Go pick on them. 

KINDERMAN
I could have you deported, you know that? 

Karras walks to the front door. 

KINDERMAN
(shouts to Karras)
I lied! 

Karras turns around. 

KINDERMAN
(shouting to Karras)
You look like Sal Mineo! 

Karras smiles and walks inside. 

EXTERIOR- BARRINGER CLINIC- DAY 

The leaves blow as the camera zooms in on the Barringer Clinic. 

INTERIOR- BARRINGER CLINIC- WARD- DAY 

CLINIC DIRECTOR
It looks like a type of disorder that you rarely ever see 
anymore, except in primitive cultures. 

We see Regan on a monitor screen. She's in another fit, in bed 
and restrained by straps. 

CLINIC DIRECTOR
We call it a somnambuliform possession. 

We cut to another angle of Regan who has slightly visible welts 
on her face. She's still screaming. We then cut to Regan, now 
flat on her back, mumbling to herself. 

INTERIOR- BARRINGER CLINIC- DIRECTOR'S OFFICE- DAY 

CLINIC DIRECTOR
Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's 
starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the 
patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien 
intellegence; a spirit if you will. 

CHRIS
Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not 
about to put her in a goddamn asylum! 

CLINIC DIRECTOR
It's- 

CHRIS
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away! 

CLINIC DIRECTOR
I'm sorry. 

CHRIS
You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell 
me is all of your bullshit... 

CLINIC DIRECTOR- There is one outside chance of a cure. I think 
of it as shock treatment. As I say, there is an outside chance... 

CHRIS
Will you just name it, for God's sake? What is it? 

MALE DOCTOR
Do you have any religious beliefs? 

CHRIS
No. 

FEMALE DOCTOR
What about your daughter? 

CHRIS
No, why? 

CLINIC DIRECTOR
Have you ever heard of exorcism? 

Chris looks at him baffled. 

CLINIC DIRECTOR
It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive 
out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded 
these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as 
a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for 
the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of 
suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; 
and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can 
make it disappear. 

CHRIS
You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch 
doctor? Is that it? 

The Clinic Director nods and looks at Chris. 

EXTERIOR- PROSPECT STREET- MACNEIL HOUSE- DAY 

A car has pulled up and Karl is exiting the driver's seat and 
opening the rear door while Sharon exits on the right rear side. 
Karl reaches in and picks up a small figure (Regan)
wrapped in a blanket from Chris' back seat. 

EXTERIOR- M STREET- DAY 

Kinderman is examing the area where Burke was found dead. He 
walks to the steep concrete steps and looks up them. We feel and 
eerie atmosphere surounding these steps. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- REGAN'S BEDROOM- DAY 

Regan is tucked up in bed. Chris moves slowly forward to the 
bedside and looks down at Regan. Chris then leans and tenderly 
adjuts her pillow. In the process, she uncovers a crucifix under 
it. She lifts it out, examining it. 

EXTERIOR- M STREET- DAY 

Kinderman begins to climb the stairs but stops and turns back. He 
looks down in a small ditch beside the steps. He clears the grass 
with his feet and reaches down for something. He picks up a small 
sculpture of an animal made of clay. He examines it and then 
climbs the steps. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY- DAY 

Chris exits Regan's room and approaches Karl who is descending 
the stairs. Chris leans over the bannister. 

CHRIS
Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom? 

KARL
She is going to be well? 

CHRIS
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now 
did you? 

KARL
No. It wasn't me. I didn't. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- STUDY- DAY 

Chris has now confronted both Sharon and Willie in the study. She 
shows the crucifix to them. 

CHRIS
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there? 

SHARON
Of course I didn't. 

WILLIE
I didn't put it. 

Karl enters the room. 

KARL
Excuse me Miss? 

CHRIS
(shouting)
What! 

KARL
A man to see you. 

CHRIS
(shouting)
What man? 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- FOYER- DAY 

Kinderman stands with his hat in his hand as Chris approaches. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- KITCHEN- DAY 

Chris and Kinderman both sit in the kitchen, coffee cups in hand. 

KINDERMAN
Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her 
room in her room that night? 

CHRIS
No, she was heavily sedated. 

KINDERMAN
It's serious? 

CHRIS
Yes, I'm affraid it is. 

KINDERMAN
May I ask...? 

CHRIS
We still don't know. 

KINDERMAN
Watch out for drafts. A draft in the fall when the house is hot 
is a magic carpet for bacteria. 

Karl enters the room. 

KARL
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else? 

CHRIS
No thanks Karl. 

Karl stands in the background. Chris turns to him. 

CHRIS
It's okay Karl. 

Karl exits. 

KINDERMAN
Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, 
stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. 
And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he 
would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his 
neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? 
My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point 
one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the 
various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - 
probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then 
pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except 
your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if 
someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the 
time you returned. The servants, they have visitors? 

CHRIS
No. Not at all, 

KINDERMAN
You were expecting a deliver y that day? 

CHRIS
Not that I know of. 

KINDERMAN
Groceries maybe? A package? 

CHRIS
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that. 

KINDERMAN
Oh, I see. 

CHRIS
Want to ask him? 

KINDERMAN
Never mind. 

Chris rises. 

CHRIS
Would you like some more coffee? 

KINDERMAN
Please. 

Kinderman follows Chris further into the kitchen. He notices some 
of Regan's artwork. He picks up a small sculpted Turtle and 
examines it. 

KINDERMAN
That's cute. 

Chris looks over at Kinderman. 

KINDERMAN
Your daughter, she's the artist? 

Chris smiles. She hands him the coffee. 

KINDERMAN
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your 
daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in 
her room that night? 

CHRIS
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first 
place. 

KINDERMAN
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never 
asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. 
Correct? 

CHRIS
When she's well enough, I'll ask. 

KINDERMAN
Couldn't hurt. In the meantime... 

Kinderman falters, embarrassed. 

KINDERMAN
I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe 
give an autograph? 

CHRIS
Of course. Have you got a pen? 

Kinderman pulls out a pen and a calling card and gives them to 
Chris. 

KINDERMAN
Oh, she'd love it. 

CHRIS
What's her name? 

Kinderman hesitates. His eyes are desperate and defiant. 

KINDERMAN
I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You 
know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times. 

CHRIS
Really? wow. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- FOYER- DAY 

Chris helps Kinderman put hic coat on. 

KINDERMAN
You're a very nice lady. 

Chris gives his hat to him. 

KINDERMAN
Thank you. 

CHRIS
You're a nice man. 

Chris opens the front door. 

KINDERMAN
I'll come back when she's feeling better. 

Kinderman exits and Chris closes the door an locks it. She holds 
her hands to her mouth and slowly walks away. We suddenly here a 
crash from Regan's room, followed by loud voices. 

REGAN
Please! No! 

MALE VOICE
Do it! 

REGAN
Please no! 

MALE VOICE
You bitch! Do it! Do it! 

Chris races up the stairs and runs to Regan's room. 

REGAN
No! Please! No! 

Chris opens the door and sees objects rapdly flying around the 
room. We hear a last gasp scream from Regan untill Chris turns to 
Regan and covers her mouth with horror. 

REGAN/DEMON
Let Jesus fuck you! 

Regan has the crucifix gripped in her hand and is plunging it 
into her bloodied vagina. There are fresh cuts all over her face, 
streaming with blood. 

REGAN/DEMON
Let Jesus fuck you! Let him fuck you!!! 

Chris runs over to Regan and tries to pry the crucifix from her 
hand. They struggle for the crucifix. Regan then grabs Chris' 
head and pushes it into her bloodied crotch. 

REGAN/DEMON
Lick me! Lick me! 

Chris' face emerges covered with Regan's blood. Regan slaps her 
mother and sends her flying to the floor. Chris screams in pain. 
Sharon and Willie race up the stairs. 

SHARON
Chris? 

The door closes by itself being held shut by a chair. They both 
bag on the door to help her. Chris looks up to see that Regan's 
wardrobe is moving toward her. Chris scurries out of the way. We 
turn back to Regan who is sitting with her back to us, but she 
has spun her head in a 180-degree angle, facing backward (Chris). 
Chris looks up at her. 

REGAN/BURKE
Do you know what she did, your cunting daughter? 

Chris turns away and screams, bursting into tears. 

EXTERIOR- 35th STREET BRIDGE AND CANAL- DAY 

Chris is standing on the bridge alone. She's wearing oversized 
dark glasses. Father Karras approaches her, he is wearing khakis, 
sweater and sturdy, scuffled tennis shoes. 

KARRAS
Chris MacNeil? 

CHRIS
Please go away. 

KARRAS
I'm Father Karras. 

Chris turns around and shakes his hand. 

CHRIS
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi. 

KARRAS
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform. 

CHRIS
Yeah, it would've helped. Have you gotta cigarette Father? 

Karras seaches his pocket and pulls out a pack of cigarettes. 
Chris takes one and Karras lights it for her. 

They walk down the steps to the canal side. 

CHRIS
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest? 

KARRAS
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med 
school. 

CHRIS
Where? 

KARRAS
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins. 

CHRIS
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right? 

KARRAS
Yes am. 

CHRIS
Pretty close? 

KARRAS
Pretty close. 

CHRIS
Did he tell you about my party? 

KARRAS
Sure did. 

CHRIS
About my daughter? 

KARRAS
No I didn't know you had one. 

CHRIS
He didn't mention? 

KARRAS
No. 

CHRIS
Didn't tell you of what she did? 

KARRAS
He didn't mention her. 

CHRIS
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then? 

KARRAS
That depends. 

CHRIS
On what? 

KARRAS
The priest. 

CHRIS
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a 
murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, 
would you have to turn him in? 

KARRAS
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no. 

CHRIS
You wouldn't. 

KARRAS
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in. 

CHRIS
And how do you go about getting an exorcism? 

KARRAS
I beg your pardon? 

CHRIS
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go 
about getting an exorcism? 

KARRAS
Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and 
send them back to the sixteenth century. 

CHRIS
I didn't get you? 

KARRAS
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil. 

CHRIS
Oh yeah, since when? 

KARRAS
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. 
All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the 
day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has 
performed an exorcism, not one. 

CHRIS
Yeah well, it just so happens that somebody very close to me is 
probably possessed, and needs an exorcist. 

Chris bursts into tears. 

CHRIS
Father Karras it's my little girl. 

Karras grabs Chris' arm and walks her over to a bench. They both 
sit. Chris is still crying. 

KARRAS
That's all the more reason to forget about exorcism. 

CHRIS
Why, I don't understand? 

KARRAS
To begin with it could make things worse. 

CHRIS
But how? 

KARRAS
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an 
investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the 
meantime... 

CHRIS
You could do it yourself... 

KARRAS
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, 
that's rarely given,- 

CHRIS
Could you see her? 

KARRAS
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist... 

CHRIS
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every 
fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now 
you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody 
help her! 

KARRAS
No, you don't understand. Your daughter- 

CHRIS
Oh, will you help her! Just help her! 

Chris bursts into tears again and buries her head into Karras 
shoulder. Karras puts his arm around her. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- STAIRCASE- DAY 

Chris and Karras are ascending the staircase. When they reach the 
door we see Karl holding a huge headboard with straps and padding 
on it. 

KARL
It wants no straps. 

Karras stares at him, then gives Chris a look. He plucks up his 
courage and enters the room. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- REGAN'S BEDROOM- DAY 

Karras stops as he sees Regan, on the bed, arms held down by a 
set of restraining straps, it seems no longer entirley Regan but 
something somehow demonic that now lies on the bed and stares at 
him. Her face is puffy, scratched and bruised from self-
mutilation. There is a sustagen flask used for a naso-gastric 
feeding, the tube is placed up her left nostril. Karras is 
momentarily taken aback. Then, reining in his revulsion, he 
slowly and warily closes the door behind him, and walks around 
the other side of the bed. 

KARRAS
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you. 

REGAN/DEMON
You might loosen the straps then. 

KARRAS
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan. 

REGAN/DEMON
I'm not Regan. 

KARRAS
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras. 

REGAN/DEMON
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps! 

KARRAS
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear? 

REGAN/DEMON
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras. 

KARRAS
Where's Regan? 

REGAN/DEMON
In here. With us. 

KARRAS
Show me Regan and I'll loosen one of the straps. 

REGAN/HOMELESS GUY
Can you help an old altar boy Fa-dah? 

Karras looks at Regan. He's puzzled by what she has just said. He 
sits down on a chair beside the window. 

REGAN/DEMON
Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a 
message? I'll see that she gets it. 

KARRAS
If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What 
is it? 

Regan keeps a sharp stare on Karras. Karras' smile turns to an 
angry stare. He rises and moves to her bed side. 

KARRAS
What is it? 

Regan leans forward a vomits a disgusting, green bile in Karras' 
face. Karras wipes it off, coughing. Regan keeps her eyes fixed 
on him, with green vomit covering her night gown. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- BASEMENT- EARLY EVENING 

Karras is looking through some of Regan's drawings. Chris 
approaches him with his sweater, now clean. She hands it to him. 

KARRAS
Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your 
daughter more harm than good. 

CHRIS
Nothing you could do would make it any worse. 

KARRAS
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as 
signs of possession. 

CHRIS
Like what? 

KARRAS
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or 
studied. 

CHRIS
What else? 

KARRAS
I don't know. I'll have to look it up. 

CHRIS
I thought you were supposed to be an expert. 

KARRAS
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession 
than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, 
she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many 
psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon 
Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six 
months, under observation in the best hospital you can find. 

CHRIS
You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same 
everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm 
telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I 
want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing 
wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know 
for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me 
that! 

EXTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- NIGHT 

Chris opens the door for Karras. He steps out on the stoop 
carrying his sweater. 

KARRAS
Did Regan know a priest was coming over? 

CHRIS
No. 

KARRAS
Did you know my mother died recently? 

CHRIS
Yes I did, I'm sorry. 

KARRAS
No, is Regan aware of it? 

CHRIS
Not at all. Why d'you ask? 

KARRAS
It's not important good night. 

Karras exits the gates and crosses the street. We cut to 
Kinderman in an unmarked car watching Karras cross the street. 
Kinderman then looks up to Regan's window and sees a silohette 
moving around. 

INTERIOR- UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON- DAHLGREN CHAPEL- DAY 

Karras is performing a service in the church. 

KARRAS
He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said "Take this, 
all of you and eat. For this is my body." When the supper had 
ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise. Gave 
the cup to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you will 
drink from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and 
ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith". 

REGAN/DEMON
(Voice Over)
What an excellent day for an exorcism. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- REGAN'S BEDROOM- DAY 

Karras pulls a tape recorder out of his bag and props an 
microphone on her bed near her. Karras sits on a chair next to 
her wardrobe. 

KARRAS
You'd like that? 

REGAN/DEMON
Intensely. 

KARRAS
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan? 

REGAN/DEMON
It would bring us together. 

KARRAS
You and Regan? 

REGAN/DEMON
You and us. 

The bureau drawer flies open on it's own. 

KARRAS
Did you do that? 

REGAN/DEMON
Uh Huh. 

Karras pushes the drawer back in. 

KARRAS
Do it again. 

REGAN/DEMON
In time. 

KARRAS
No now. 

REGAN/DEMON
In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree? 

Karras presses record on the tape recorder. 

KARRAS
You speak Latin? 

REGAN/DEMON
Ego te abslovo. 

KARRAS
Quod nomen mihi est? 

REGAN/DEMON
Bon Jour. 

KARRAS
Quod nomen mihi est? 

REGAN/DEMON
La plume de ma tante. 

The demon laughs full and mockingly. 

KARRAS
How long are you planning to stay in Regan? 

REGAN/DEMON
Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth. 

Karraspulls out a small vial of water. 

REGAN/DEMON
What's that? 

KARRAS
Holy water. 

Karras moves to the end of the bed. 

REGAN/DEMON
You keep it away. 

Karras uncaps the vial and now sprinkles it's contents over 
Regan. Instantly, Regan writhes in pain and terror. 

REGAN/DEMON
Ahhhhhhhhhhh! Ahhhhhhh! It burns! Ohhhh! It burns! 

Regan's head falls back onto the pillow as she rolls her head 
from side to side shouting out indistrict gibberish: 

REGAN/DEMON
Emit su evig! 

Karras is intrigued and sits on the bed beside her. He moves the 
microphone up to her mouth an listens. 

REGAN/DEMON
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! 
Nirrem! Nirrem! 

KARRAS
Who are you? 

REGAN/DEMON
Tseirp a si eh! Eno on ma I! Eno on ma I! Ahhhhhhhhhhh! 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- STUDY- DAY 

We see Karras descending the stairs as we hear Chris on the phone 
with someone. Karras waits outside until Chris is finished. 

CHRIS
(on the phone)
Okay, I'll talk to you some other time. No it's just that I'm 
going through something and... No, no there's nothing. Thanks 
alot. Bye. 

Chris hangs up the phone. Karras enters and sits on the couch. 

CHRIS
Wanna drink. 

KARRAS
Please. 

CHRIS
What do you drink? 

Chris walks to the drinks cabinet. 

KARRAS
Scotch, Ice, water. 

Chris pours the drink. 

CHRIS
No ice. I'll get some from the kitchen. 

Chris walks toward the kitchen but Karras stops her. 

KARRAS
No it's alright I'll take it straight. 

CHRIS
Are you sure? 

KARRAS
It's fine really, sit. 

Chris sits down. 

KARRAS
Where's Regan's father? 

CHRIS
In Europe. 

KARRAS
Have you told him what's happening? 

CHRIS
No 

KARRAS
Well I think you should. 

He holds up the empty vial. 

KARRAS
I told Regan that was holy water, I sprinkled some on her and she 
reacted very violently. It's tap water. 

CHRIS
What's the difference? 

KARRAS
Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't help support a case for 
possession. 

Chris turns her head away and frowns. She looks at Karras again. 

CHRIS
(whispering)
She...killed Burke Dennings. 

KARRAS
What? 

CHRIS
She killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out of the window. 

Karras looks shocked. 

INTERIOR- LANGUAGE LAB- NIGHT 

Karras is with the lab director. They are listening to Karras 
recording of Regan. Karras is tense. 

The director stops the tape. 

LAB DIRECTOR
It's a language alright. It's english. 

Karras stands up. 

KARRAS
What do you mean english? 

LAB DIRECTOR
It's english in reverse, listen. 

The lab director throws a switch and the tape starts again, in 
perfect english. 

REGAN/DEMON
(tape)
Give us time! Let her die! 

INTERIOR- KARRAS' ROOM- NIGHT 

Karras is listening to the eerie, unearthly voices on the tape. 

REGAN/DEMON
(tape)
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest! 

KARRAS
(tape)
Uoy era ohw. 

REGAN/DEMON
(tape)
Merrin! Merrin! 

Karras stops the tape and rewinds it slightly. He plays it again. 

REGAN/DEMON
(tape)
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest! 

KARRAS
(tape)
Uoy era ohw. 

The phone rings and startles him. He answers the phone. 

KARRAS
(on phone)
Yeah, yes?...I'll be right there. 

EXTERIOR- PROSPECT STREET- NIGHT 

It's very late, Karras is running down the street. He comes to 
the gate of the MacNeil house. Sharon opens the gate. She's 
holding a flashlightand she puts her finger on her lips for 
quiet. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- STAIRWAY- NIGHT 

They both ascend the stairs and creep toward Regan's room. 

SHARON
(whispering)
I don't want Chris to see this. 

KARRAS
Well what's wrong? What is it? 

They stop at Regan's door. Sharon puts her coat on and turns on 
the flash light. She opens the door and they enter. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- REGAN'S BEDROOM- NIGHT 

Sharon closes the door behind them. Karras reacts to the extreme 
cold. His breath, like Sharon's, is frosttily condensing in the 
chill air of the room. He looks at Sharon with wonder. They both 
approach the bedside. They stop by the bed. Regan seems to be in 
a coma, heavily breathing. Sharon is bending, gently pulling 
Regan's pajama top wide apart, exposing Regan's stomach. Sharon 
points the flashlight at Regan's stomach. Karras looks in shock 
when we see on her stomach, rising up slowly on her skin are two 
words HELP ME. Karras' eyes are fixed on these two words as we 
once again see them on Regan's stomach. 

INTERIOR- HEALY BUILDING- GROUND FLOOR HALLWAY- DAY 

Karras walks down the hall toward the stairway. He climbs the 
stairs and we follow him to the top. 

INTERIOR- HEALY BUILDING- CARDINAL'S OFFICE- DAY 

In the room, Karras and the Cardinal. 

CARDINAL
You're convinced that it's genuine. 

KARRAS
I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent 
judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual. 

CARDINAL
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself? 

KARRAS
Yes. 

CARDINAL
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone 
who's spent time in the foreign missions. 

KARRAS
I see, your excellency. 

CARDINAL
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as 
I know. 

KARRAS
Thank you your excellency. 

Karras stands up and kisses the Cardinal's hand. 

INTERIOR- GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT'S OFFICE- DAY 

PRESIDENT
Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in 
just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, 
anyway. 

CARDINAL
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas? 

PRESIDENT
How about Lankaster Merrin. 

CARDINAL
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was 
working on a dig around Nineveh. 

PRESIDENT
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three 
ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now. 

CARDINAL
What's he doing there? Teaching? 

PRESIDENT
No, he's working on another book. 

CARDINAL
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health? 

PRESIDENT
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. 
Besides, he's had experience. 

CARDINAL
I didn't know that. 

PRESIDENT
Ten maybe twelve years ago, in Africa. The exorcism supposedly 
lasted for months. I heard it damn near killed him. 

EXTERIOR- PROSPECT STREET- MACNEIL HOUSE- NIGHT 

A cab pulls up to the house in long shot. Out of the cab steps a 
tall, old priest, carrying a battered valise. A hat obscures his 
face. As the cab pulls away, the priest stands rooted in the 
mist, staring up at the second floor window like a melancholy 
traveler frozen in time. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- FRONT DOOR- NIGHT 

Chris opens the door, disclosing the priest, face still shaded by 
the hat, and Roman collar by coat buttoned at the top. 

MERRIN
Mrs. MacNeil? 

CHRIS
Yes. 

MERRIN
I'm Father Merrin. 

CHRIS
Come in. 

Merrin takes off his hat and coat. 

MERRIN
Is Father Karras here? 

Karras enters the foyer. Chris takes Merrin's hat and coat. 

CHRIS
Yes. He's already here. 

KARRAS
Father? 

Merrin walks over to greet Karras. 

MERRIN
Father Karras. 

They shake hands. 

KARRAS
It's an honour to meet you Father. 

They both look up as the scream of the demon, booming, 
amplifying, comes from Regan's room. 

REGAN/DEMON
MERRIN!!!!!!! 

MERRIN
Are you tired? 

KARRAS
No. 

MERRIN
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and 
gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, 
and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large 
one. I believe we should begin. 

KARRAS
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first? 

MERRIN
Why? 

EXTERIOR- UNIVERSITY STEPS-NIGHT 

Karras is running down the steps carrying a the cassocks and a 
large case. 

MERRIN
( Voice Over )
Especially important is the warning to avoid conversation with 
the demon. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- STUDY- NIGHT 

Karras and Merrin are dressing in vestments taken from the case. 

MERRIN
We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is 
dangerous. He is a liar, the demon is a liar. He will lie to 
confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack 
us. The attack is psychological , Damien. And powerful. So don't 
listen, remember that, do not listen. 

KARRAS
I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the 
different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems 
to be three. She's convinced- 

MERRIN
There's only one. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- SECOND FLOOR LANDING- NIGHT 

Merrin and Karras, fully vested, Roman Rituals in hand, slowly 
ascend the stairs in single file. We can hear the demon making 
horrible, growling noises in the room. The priests approach Chris 
and Sharon, bundled in sweaters . The priests halt, and look at 
Chris. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- REGAN'S BEDROOM- NIGHT 

Merrin opens the door and sees Regan staring at him with burning 
eyes. Merrin steps into the room follwed by Karras. Karras closes 
the door on Chris before she walks in. Merrin walks to the side 
of the bed and Karras halts at the foot. ( the room is freezing. 
Breath is condensing throughout). Merrin lays his holy water on 
the bedside table, takes a crucifix out of a leather case. He 
then traces the sign of the cross at Regan. She looks up. 

REGAN/DEMON
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless 
cocksucker! 

MERRIN
Be silent! 

Merrin sprinkles some holy water on her. She throws her head back 
and crys in pain. Merrin leans down beside her and opens up The 
Roman Ritual. 

MERRIN
Our Father who art in heaven... 

Regan spits and hits Merrin in the eye with a yellowish glob of 
mucus that slowly oozes down his cheek. Karras quickly hides 
behind the bed post as Merrin pulls out a handkerchief and 
unhurriedly wipes away the spittle: 

MERRIN
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on 
earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and 
forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass 
against us. And lead us not into temptation. 

KARRAS
But deliver us from the evil one. 

Regan is coughing and groaning as the two priests continue with 
the ritual. 

MERRIN
Save me o' God by thy name, by thy might defend my cause, proud 
men have risen up against me, men of violence seek my life, but 
God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every need he has 
delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the Holy 
Spirit. 

KARRAS
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without 
end, amen. 

MERRIN
Save your servant 

KARRAS
Who places her trust in thee, my God. 

MERRIN
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower. 

KARRAS
In the face of the enemy. 

Regan raises her head and screams at Merrin several times. 

MERRIN
Let the enemy have no power over her. 

KARRAS
And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her. 

REGAN/DEMON
Your mother sucks cocks in hell Karras, you faithless slime! 

MERRIN
O'Lord hear my prey. 

KARRAS
And let my cry come unto thee. 

MERRIN
The Lord be with you. 

KARRAS
And also with you. 

MERRIN
Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and 
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned 
that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only 
begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion. 

Regans bed begins to jump up and down, crashing onto the floor. 
Regan continues to scream at the two priests. 

MERRIN
Hasten to our call for help and snatch from ruination and from 
the clutches of the noonday devil, this human being made in your 
image and likeness. Strike terror Lord, into the beast, now 
laying waste your vineyard, let your mighty hand cast him out of 
your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil, so he may no longer hold 
captive this person, whom it pleased you to make in your image. 

Merrin sprinkles more holy water on Regan. She falls back crying 
in pain. 

MERRIN
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, 
in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever. 

KARRAS
Amen 

MERRIN
O'Lord hear my preyer. 

To Karras' amazement the bed begins to rise. Merrin waits for 
Damien's reponse, but Karras is frozen with shock as the bed 
rises past his face. 

MERRIN
Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien! 

KARRAS
And let my cry come unto thee. 

The bed crashes back to the floor. Regan still screams and 
writhes in pain. 

MERRIN
Almighty Lord, word of God the father Jesus Christ, God and Lord 
of all creation, who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp 
underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me, your unworthy servant 
pardon for all my sins... 

REGAN/DEMON
Bastards! Stop! 

Regan stares at Father Karras and snakes her abnormaly long 
tongue in and out at him. 

MERRIN
...and the power to confront this cruel demon. 

KARRAS
Amen 

Regan falls back on her pillow and begins to groan. Both priests 
trace the sign of the cross. Merrin holds his purple stole to 
Regan's cheek as green vomit slowly oozes from her mouth. Regan 
turns her head and vomits on the stole. 

MERRIN
See the cross of the Lord. Be gone you hostile power. O'Lord hear 
my prayer. 

KARRAS
And let my cry come unto thee. 

MERRIN
The Lord be with you. 

KARRAS
And also with you. 

Merrin takes the bile covered stole from around his neck and 
hands it to Karras who quickly washes it in Regan's bathroom. We 
hear banging, as cupboard doors open against the wall. Regan is 
flat on her back laughing wickedly. Merrin holds his hands to his 
ears because of the noise. Karras hands the stole back to Merrin, 
who kisses it before applying around his neck. Regan continues to 
laugh as Merrin begins to cough violently. 

MERRIN
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...! 

REGAN/DEMON
Shove it up your ass you faggot! 

MERRIN
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands 
you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of 
hell! 

REGAN/DEMON
Fuck him!!! 

MERRIN
...Be gone!! 

REGAN/DEMON
Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!! 

MERRIN
...from this creature of God!!! 

Regan lays back as Merrin races to her bedside tracing the sign 
of the cross with his fingers in her hair. 

MERRIN
Be gone!! In the name of the Father, and of the son, and of the 
holy spirit!! By this sign of the holy cross, of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, who lives and reigns with the father and the holy 
spirit... 

Regan sits up and with a nightmare slowness, a fraction at a 
time, her head begins to turn, swiveling like a mannequin's and 
creaking with the sound of a rusted mechanism. Once again 
Damien's attention is diverted and Merrin has to prompt him. 

MERRIN
Damien!!! 

Her head completly turns in a 360-degree turn and stares at 
Karras. 

KARRAS
Amen. 

MERRIN
Defender of the human race... 

A thunderous earthquake knock both priests to the ground. 

MERRIN
...look down in pity... 

REGAN/DEMON
You killed your mother!!! You left her alone to die!!!! She'll 
never forgive you!!! Bastard!!! 

KARRAS
Shut up!! 

MERRIN
... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil. 

Another quake knocks them to the ground. Regan falls back, the 
bed sheets fly off of the bed and the straps slowly rip apart. 
Regan's eyes roll back into the socket and she slowly starts to 
levitate. 

MERRIN
I command you by the judge of the living and the dead, to depart 
from this servant of God. 

Regan is now levitating toward the celing, arms out stretched 
like a cross. 

MERRIN
It's the power! (To Karras)- Holy water. 

Karras runs to the bedside table and grabs the bottle of holy 
water, he runs back and gives it to Merrin. 

MERRIN
It's the power of Christ, that compels you. 

MERRIN + KARRAS
The power of Christ compels you. 

Merrin sprinkles holy water. 

MERRIN + KARRAS
The power of Christ compels you. 

Merrin sprinkles holy water and we see a cut appear on her skin. 

MERRIN + KARRAS
The power of Christ compels you. The power of Christ compels you. 
The power of Christ compels you. The power of Christ compels you. 

Regan begins to descend. 

MERRIN + KARRAS
The power of Christ compels you. The power of Christ compels you. 
The power of Christ compels you. The power of Christ compels you. 
The power of Christ compels you. The power of Christ compels you. 
The power of Christ compels you. 

Regan lands back on the bed once more. 

MERRIN + KARRAS
The power of Christ compels you. 

Karras rushes to the bed and ties her hands together to symbolize 
the cross. 

MERRIN
He brought you low by his bloodstained cross! Do not despise my 
command because you no me to be a sinner. It's God himself who 
commands you! The majestic Christ who commands! God the Father 
commands you! God the son commands you! 

As Karras turns away, Regan raises her tied hands and deals him a 
powerful blow on the back of his head. He falls to the floor. 

MERRIN
God the holy spirit commands you! 

Merrin sprinkles more holy water on Regan, she falls back and 
screams in pain. 

MERRIN
The mystery of the cross commands you! The blood of the martyrs 
commands you! 

The priests are again knocked to the floor by an earthquake. 
Briefly Regan lifts herself toward an apparition of the demon 
statue Pazuzu. 

MERRIN
Give way to Christ, you prince of murderers. You're guilty, 
before Almighty God, guilty before his son, guilty before the 
whole human race. It's the Lord who expels you. He who is coming 
to judge both the living and the dead and the world by fire. 

As Merrin kneels by the bed, Karras crawls over and covers Regan 
with a blanket. 

MERRIN
Are you tired? 

Karras nods. 

MERRIN
Let's rest before we start again. 

Merrin leaves the room, but Karras stays sat on the bed, 
shivering with both coldness and fear. Regan is asleep. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY- STAIRS- NIGHT 

An exhausted Merrin and Karras are sitting in the hallway, on the 
stairs, outside the bathroom. 

KARRAS
Why this girl it makes no sense? 

MERRIN
I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves 
as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God 
could love us. 

MERRIN
Will you excuse me, Damien? 

Merrin rises and moves toward the bathroom. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- BATHROOM- NIGHT 

Merrin sits on the toilet and takes out his pilbox. He extracts a 
nitorglycerin tablet and places it under his tongue. He is 
shaking with fear as he holds his head with exhaustion. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY- NIGHT 

Karras moves back toward the bedroom and enters. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- REGAN'S BEDROOM- NIGHT 

Karras is shocked to see an instant apparition of his mother, 
laying on the bed in place of Regan. It vanishes. He moves toward 
Regan, who is shivering and drenched with sweat. 

REGAN/MRS. KARRAS
Dimmy, why you did this to me? 

Karras gets out a stehoscope and places it on Regan's chest. 

REGAN/MRS. KARRAS
Please Dimmy, I'm affraid. 

KARRAS
You're not my mother. 

REGAN/MRS. KARRAS
Dimmy please! 

Merrin re-enters the room. 

MERRIN
What is it? 

KARRAS
Her heart. 

MERRIN
Can you give her something? 

KARRAS
She'll go into coma. 

Regan, in the voice of Karras' mother, speaks a few pleading 
phrases in Greek to Karras. 

KARRAS
(shouting)
You're not my mother!!! 

MERRIN
Don't listen. 

REGAN/MRS. KARRAS
Why, Dimmy? 

Damien breaks into convulsive sobbing. 

MERRIN
Damien. 

REGAN/MRS. KARRAS
Dimmy, please! 

MERRIN
Damien! Get out! 

Damien arises from the bed. Merrin leads him out, and then re-
enters the room himself. He sprinkles some holy water on Regan 
and kneels at her side. He holds her hand tightly. 

MERRIN
Our Father, who art in heaven... 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- FOYER- NIGHT 

Downstairs Karras sits brooding as Chris enters. 

CHRIS
Is it over? 

Karras shakes his head negatively. 

CHRIS
Is she gonna die? 

KARRAS
(firmly)
No. 

He rises and starts ascending the stairs with renewed conviction. 
The doorbell rings and Chris moves toward the door. Before 
opening she applies the chain lock on. She opens the door slowly 
and we see Kinderman staring at her from the gap. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- REGAN'S BEDROOM- NIGHT 

Karras re-enters Regan's room and sees Merrin face down on her 
bed. Regan is sitting up against the bottom right hand bed post 
as Karras pulls Merrin to the floor. Karras feels for Merrin's 
pulse, then tries frantically to pump life back into the priest 
with blows to his chest, but gives up when he realises Merrin is 
dead. He hears a giggle and turns to Regan. 

KARRAS
You son of a bitch! 

He grabs her and pulls her to the floor. He begins to punch her 
in the face and head, then shakes her and nearly strangles her in 
his fury. 

KARRAS
Take me! Come into me! God damn you! Take me! Take me! 

A gargantuan struggle is visible in the demonic features of 
Regan's face. His face has taken on a demonic shade, and his eyes 
have turned bright green. She screams out as Karras' body jerks 
back, apparently manipulated by some inner force, which now 
reaches toward Regan to strangle her. Karras fights the force for 
control of his body, and he screams, compelling it toward the 
window. 

KARRAS
No!! 

With his last angiushed cry, Karras leaps out of the window. We 
see him roll down the concrete steps outside and hit the floor at 
the bottom. His cry was immediatly followed by frightened sobs 
and whimpers that are unmstakably those of an ordinary little 
girl. 

REGAN
(crying)
Mother...Mother...Mother...Mother... 

Chris rushes in and pauses to make sure that it's really Regan 
again. She's follwed in by Kinderman. 

CHRIS
Rags? 

She dashes over to where her daughter is cowering on the floor. 
She flings herself down on top of Regan, cradling her and crying 
in hysterical relief, as Kinderman looks at Karras' body from the 
window, looks at Merrin's dead body on the floor and then looks 
at Chris and Regan. 

EXTERIOR- M-STREET- STEPS- NIGHT 

A crowd is gathering at the scene of an accident. Their 
attentionis focused by a man lying in a pool of blood on the 
pavement at the foot of the steps under Regan's window. 

BYSTANDER
Somebody fell at the bottom of the steps here! 

Father Dyer pushes through the crowd and kneels beside Karras. 
Fighting back tears, he grasps Karras' hand and leans close to 
whisper in his ear. 

FATHER DYER
Do you want to make your confession? Are you sorry- (his voice 
catches)
Are you sorry for having offended God, with all the sins of your 
past life? (he breaks down for a moment, then starts 
administiring the last rites)
Ego to abslovo in nomine patris, et filli, et spiritus sancti. 
Amen. 

As a wailling siren signals the approach of an ambulance, Dyer 
weeps openly. 

EXTERIOR- PROSPECT STREET- TOP OF STEPS- DAY 

On a bright, sunny day, we are looking down the steps which are 
now clean. No blood, or body at the bottom. 

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- DINING ROOM- DAY 

Sharon and Chris are briskly packing up last minute items before 
moving out. 

SHARON
Where do you want this? 

CHRIS
What is it? 

SHARON
Phonograph. 

CHRIS
Storage. 

Sharon puts in in one of the large cardboard boxes that are 
standing about. 

CHRIS
I'm gonna miss you. 

SHARON
Me too. 

CHRIS
Sure you won't change your mind? 

Sharon shakes her head. She reaches into her pocket and hands 
Chris the St. Joseph medal. 

SHARON
I found this in her room. 

Chris puts in her pocket. 

SHARON
That's everything. 

Chris hugs her. She pulls away and walks to the foot of the 
stairs. 

CHRIS
Regan! C'mon honey we have to get going! 

EXTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- PROSPECT STREET- DAY 

We see Karl is loading the car with cases. Father Dyer is 
standing outside the gates. Chris exits the house and Dyer moves 
toward her. 

CHRIS
She doesn't remeber a thing. 

FATHER DYER
That's good. 

Regan exits the house and walks to Chris. 

REGAN
All done. 

CHRIS
Honey this is Father Dyer. 

REGAN
Hi Father. 

DYER
Hello. 

KARL
Ready Mrs. 

Chris shakes Father Dyer's hand. 

CHRIS
Goodbye Father. I call you. 

FATHER DYER
Okay. 

Chris gets into the car, but Regan stands staring at Dyer's 
collar. She leans forward and kisses Father Dyer on the cheek. 
Not sure of what she has done, she retreats to the car. The car 
drives out to the street and Father Dyer waves goodbye. Father 
Dyer walks out and Willie closes the gates. 

FATHER DYER
Goodbye. 

WILLIE
Good bye Father. 

FATHER DYER
I hope to see you again soon, 

WILLIE
I hope so too. 

The car stops and we hear Chris call. 

CHRIS
Father Dyer? 

Dyer rushes to the car. 

CHRIS
I thought you'd like to keep this. 

She hands him Karras' St. Joseph medal. Dyer clutches it tightly. 
The car drives on, and Dyer watches it drive off. Dyer walks down 
toward the top of the M Street Steps. He looks down them and 
frowns, we see Regan's window in the background, boarded up. Dyer 
then turns away and walks back to Prospect Street. As he turns 
the corner he sees Kinderman standing outside the house. 

FATHER DYER
Lieutenant? 

KINDERMAN
I came to say goodbye. 

FATHER DYER
You just missed them. 

KINDERMAN
How's the girl? 

FATHER DYER
She seemed fine. 

KINDERMAN
Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. 
Back to work. Bye now, Father. 

FATHER DYER
Good bye. 

They both walk their separate ways. Kinderman stops. 

KINDERMAN
Father Dyer? 

Dyer turns back to him. 

KINDERMAN
Do you like films? 

FATHER DYER
Sure. 

KINDERMAN
I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. 
Would you like to go? 

FATHER DYER
What's playing. 

KINDERMAN
Withering Heights. 

FATHER DYER
Who's in it? 

KINDERMAN
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine 
Earnshaw, Lucille Ball. 

FATHER DYER
I've seen it. 

KINDERMAN
Another one. Had your lunch? 

FATHER DYER
No. 

Kinderman loops his arm around Dyer's. They start to walk off. 

KINDERMAN
I'm reminded of a line in the film Casablanca. At the end 
Humphrey Bogart says to Claude Rains, " Louie- I think this is 
the begining of a beautiful friendship." 

DYER
You know you look a bit like Bogart. 

KINDERMAN
You noticed. 

We fade out as Tubular Bells starts to play.

The music changes to the loud Fantasia For Strings.

              FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3: 3D


              FADE IN:
 
              TITLE AND CREDITS
 
              A piercing high note is sustained on the soundtrack as the
              main title, "CRYSTAL JAPAN" speeds straight at the audience
              in 3-D and seems to jump right out at them.
 
              The opening credits follow.  Ominous theme music fills the
              soundtrack, growing darker and more dissonant.
 
              The theme music slowly dissolves into the sound of a radio
              news broadcast, as the credits continue to unfold.
 
                                  RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                        ...and I'm Ed Harris with the KLTZ
                        Early Morning Report.
 
              Theme music out.

                               (continuing)
                        Crystal Lake in Pinehurst County,
                        the scene of several unsolved
                        deaths years ago, is tragically
                        back in the top of the news this
                        morning.  Police have uncovered
                        the remains of eight, as yet,
                        unidentified persons in a gruesome
                        and baffling story of mass
                        murder...

              EXT. ROADSIDE MARKET - EVENING
 
              Shooting over a line of ruffled bushes with leaves just
              turning towards a rural, time-worn country market.  A wide
              gravel parking area makes it accessible to the highway
              running past it, otherwise, this Mom & Pop store seems almost
              like a vision of times gone by.
 
              The bushes and overgrown grass, unrestrained by any human
              care, strengthen the sense of isolation.  The dying sun
              shoots its last rays through the trees behind the market.
 
              The market has a battered second-story: the living quarters
              of the people running it.  A truck roars by.  Then silence,
              and then again the sound of the radio news report:

                                  RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                        ...Judging from the sheer
                        brutality of the murders, police
                        theorize that they must have been
                        committed by at least four
                        persons...
 
              EXT. THE HOUSE / STORE - ANOTHER ANGLE
 
              Sagging clotheslines cluttered with drying laundry run across
              a narrow backyard, all the way to a rickety old shed.  The
              clotheslines are supported by one solitary pole.  Linen and
              garments billow in the rising evening breeze.
 
              Cold, foreboding music accompanies the camera as it moves
              toward a pair of flapping khaki pants and an olive green
              workshirt hanging side by side on the line.
 
              The radio news report grows louder as the clothing snaps
              directly into the lens.
 
                                  RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

                        in Linfield for observation.
                        She's been unable to provide
                        police with any clues and is being
                        kept under round the clock guard...
 
              HEAVY FOOTSTEPS
 
              And then a man parts two shrouds of wet laundry, making his
              way back towards the house.  This is HAROLD: 40ish, paunchy,
              unshaven and so clumsy that he hits the clothesline pole and
              knocks it down, burying himself under a heap of linen.  A
              transistor radio pops out of the pocket of his threadbare
              shirt, still broadcasting the news.  One of the upstairs
              windows opens with a creak, and
 
              EDNA
 
              Harold's wife, sticks her head out and looks into the
              backyard:
 
                                  EDNA
                               (loud, harsh)
                        Goddamnit Harold!  I spent all day
                        yesterday washing your clothes and
                        look what you're doing to 'em.
                        Shows how much you care about me.

              Harold watches her from under the pile of laundry.  Then he
              grabs the radio, staggers up, increasing the radio's volume
              as he does so, to drown out the voice of his wife.
 
              Above him, Edna raves on for a moment (we can't make out what
              she is saying), then furiously slams the window shut.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. UPSTAIRS LIVING ROOM - EVENING
 
              The room is musty and cluttered like an old attic.  Edna
              stomps away from the window and turns her attention to the
              partially functional, old clunker of a black and white TV.
              She plops herself down onto the lumpy couch and picks up two
              knitting needles and returns to work on a sweater.  A news
              report about the mass murders is being broadcast.

                        just before dawn.  Reports of
                        cannibalism and sexual mutilation

                        brutal in local history.
 
              EDNA
 
              Leans in to adjust the long rabbit-ear antenna, spreading the
              ears apart for a better picture.  She listens intently.

                        murders remains a mystery at this
                        hour as does the identity of the
                        killer or killers.  The search

              Visibly upset, Edna rises to her feet.  She goes over to the
              door leading downstairs to the market, opens it and call out.
 
                                  EDNA
                        Harold, what're you doing down
                        there?
 
              No response.  She rushes to the window, jerks it open and
              sticks her head out.
 
                                  EDNA

              No answer.

              of the backyard.  The laundry quietly swells in the wind.
              For an instant, a human form is visible between layers of
              drying clothes.  From this distance, Edna can't make out who
              it is.
 
                                  EDNA
                        Harold?
 
              INT. HOUSE
 
              Unnerved by the continuing noise of the TV, Edna goes back to
              shut it off.  She quickly returns to the window and looks out
              again.
 
              EDNA'S POV
 
              No sign of anyone, but there is an empty span of clothesline
              where several articles of clothes were hung, only a second
              before.
 
              INT. HOUSE
 
              Edna runs for the apartment door.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. MARKET - EVENING
 
              Edna flies down the stairs and enters the store from the
              back.  The market is dark, save does shafts of dying sunlight
              through the grimy front windows.

              She scans the few aisles back and forth.
 
                                  EDNA
                        Harold?
 
              A big rabbit appears from behind an arrangement of Campbell's
              soup cans, and stands on its hind legs on the aisle, trying
              to guess Edna's next move.  Still calling Harold, she turns;
              starts at the sight of the rabbit; she grabs a tomato from
              the produce display, throw it at the animal.
 
                                  EDNA
                               (continuing)
                        God Damn pest, what are you
                        staring at?
 
              She misses, grabs more vegetables and hurls them at the
              rabbit.  The rabbit dodges them, and scurries away.
 
              EXT. BACKYARD - EVENING
 
              The sunlight is almost gone, stretching the shadows even
              more.  In her nightgown, Edna pushed open the creaky screen
              door and steps out into the backyard.
 
              Shooting towards her through the laundry flapping on the
              clothesline.  As she touches a set of pajamas and finds out
              that they are still wet.
 
              A shoulder suddenly enters the flame, and someone's
              silhouette blocks the screen just for a couple of seconds,
              before the intruder slips behind another curtain of drying
              clothes, revealing Edna again:  she's still checking the
              clothes and hasn't noticed anything.
 
              She comes to where the trousers and workshirt were, and no
              longer.  That's a shock, but she's not quite sure that they
              were here in the first place, so she goes on, and starts
              talking to herself to fortify her ailing courage.
 
                                  EDNA
                        Christ All Mighty, Harold, you
                        just take what's yours and leave
                        the rest for me to do.  Very
                        considerate!
                               (collecting the dry
                                laundry and putting
                                it in a basket)
                        You could at least finished the
                        job.  Do I have to do everything
                        around here?
 
              Edna hears a noise and whips around.  Her imagination is
              working overtime.

              A bedsheet is swelling slowly in the breeze, taking the shape
              of a human body.  Is anyone behind it?  Ominous music...
 
                                  EDNA
                               (swallowing hard)
                        Harold... I swear, sometimes
                        you're such a child...
 
              She charges forward.  She rips the sheet off the line and
              falls in a heap with it.  There is no one behind it.
 
              She turns over and lays on her back.  Above her, there's only
              the dark evening sky and the branches of a tree, rustling
              back and forth.
 
              Edna gets up and quickly pulls the remaining laundry off the
              lines, tossing it into the basket.  As she does, she passes
              near the wooden shed at the back of the store.
 
              EXT. YARD
 
              The shed door creak open.  Edna turns around.  Suddenly,
              there's a crashing noise from inside.  That's enough for
              Edna... she hauls up the basket and rushes back inside the
              store.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. MARKET - NIGHT
 
              The white rabbit that gave Edna such a scare is now hopping
              across a row of canned goods.  A man's hand enters frame and
              grabs the rabbit by the nape of its neck and lifts it off the
              shelf, into his arms.
 
              It's Harold.  He places the rabbit on his shoulder and grabs
              a jar of peanuts from the shelf.  He twists open the vacuum-
              sealed jar and wolfs down a handful of its contents.  With
              another handful, he feeds the rabbit, who sniffs and partakes.
 
              Harold rescrews the lid and places it back on the shelf.  He
              turns on the radio in his breast pocket.  Music blares.
 
              He grabs his broom and starts sweeping down the aisle, the
              rabbit remaining contentedly on his shoulder.
 
              Harold stops at the dairy case and grabs a half-gallon jug of
              milk.  He breaks the seal and pulls off the cap.  He first
              offers the rabbit a taste, then gulps down a swig himself.

              IN THE BACKGROUND
 
              An unidentified face, in soft focus, peers in through the
              storefront window then disappears almost as quickly.  Harold
              is unaware.
 
              HAROLD
 
              screws the cap back on and replaces the jug in the case.
 
              The sound of crunching and munching.
 
              Harold turns around.  The the produce section, the cellophane
              packages of carrots on display are moving slightly.
 
              He reaches in and pushes off the top few packages to reveal,
              underneath, another rabbit, a grey one this time, nibbling on
              a carrot.
 
              He lifts the rabbit out of the case and places it on his
              opposite shoulder.
 
                                  HAROLD
                               (looking from one
                                rabbit to the other)
                        Sorry guys, it's back to the
                        slammer before Edna make a fur
                        coat out of ya.
 
              On his way to the back door, Harold passes a rack of cakes
              and pies.  He stops long enough to open a box of six
              chocolate-covered donuts.  He takes one out and shoves it
              into his mouth.
 
              Unbeknownst to Harold, a human form in shadow appears at the
              back door.  The door is quietly pushed open.  Someone is
              watching him.
 
              The camera as stalker enters the store and moves slowly
              towards Harold, his back to us.  Ominous music accompanies
              the approach.
 
              Checks filled to capacity.  Harold closes the package and
              puts it back in place on the rack, hiding it under several
              unopened packages.
 
              Harold turns.  The stalker is right behind him, completely
              startled, he jumps back and chokes on the doughnuts.  The
              rabbits hop off his shoulders.
 
              Unexpectedly, Harold find himself face to face... with his
              wife, Edna.

                                  EDNA
                        Didn't I feed you enough for
                        breakfast?
 
              Harold doesn't answer.
 
                                  EDNA
                               (continuing)
                        The doctor said you had to lose
                        weight, didn't he?  I try to help
                        you but you sneak food behind my
                        back.  What am I gonna do with you?
 
              Without a word, Harold bends down to retrieve the rabbits.
              He scoops them up in his arms.
 
                                  EDNA
                               (continuing)
                        And put those filthy animals back
                        where they belong, please!
 
              Harold exits by way of the back door.

              Harold puts the grey rabbit on his shoulder, the white rabbit
              remains wrapped in his arms.  He swallows the rest of the
              doughnut in his mouth as he flips a flashlight out of his
              back pocket and ambles across the yard.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. SHED - NIGHT
 
              Light filters through the cracked walls partially
              illuminating a variety of tools, old barrels, various odds &
              ends - and a rabbit hutch.
 
              Harold flicks on the flashlight as he enters.  The rabbit
              atop his shoulder jumps off and scurries away.  The rabbit in
              his arms squirms and squeals.  The animals sense that
              something is wrong.
 
                                  HAROLD
                               (stroking the white
                                rabbit)
                        What're you little guys so nervous
                        about?
 
              He scans the shed with the flashlight to locate the runaway
              as he tries to contain the jittery ball of fur in his arms.

              The flashlight searches each corner, until the beam finally
              stops on:
 
              THE RABBIT HUTCH
 
              Music pounds hard on the soundtrack, as through the hutch
              grillwork we can see a mass of dead rabbits, lying one next
              to the other, staring up with glinting, glass eyes.
 
              Harold stands immobilized, in a state of shock.  He looks
              down upon the limp bodies of his beloved pets, his face
              turned into a sad mask of outrage.  He holds onto the white
              rabbit even tighter.
 
                                  HAROLD
                        Who would do this...?
 
              Trembling, Harold reaches to lift the lid of the hutch.  The
              music throbs...
 
              A big timber rattlesnake springs out of the hutch, mouth wide
              and open, twin poisonous fangs shining in the beam of the
              flashlight.
 
              The music drops out as the snake's loud kiss dominates.  The
              muscles of its dark, lean body push the deadly mouth ahead,
              into the lens of the camera.
 
              Instinctively, Harold slams the hutch down, dropping his
              flashlight and the white rabbit.  The snake hisses and spits
              at the camera through the wife mesh.
 
              Literally scared shitless, Harold races out of the shed,
              holding his stomach with both hands.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
 
              Harold dashes through the back door, and up the stairs like
              a charging bull.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. UPSTAIRS LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT
 
              Harold bursts through the door, crashing into his
              unsuspecting wife.  Edna is knocked off balance and tries to
              hold onto him.
 
                                  EDNA
                        What happened?  What's the matter?

              Harold can't talk.  He rubs his stomach and heads straight
              for the bathroom, vanishing inside.
 
                                  EDNA
                               (continuing)
                        It's all the crap you've been
                        stuffing yourself with.
 
              Edna turns up the volume on the TV and plunks herself down on
              the couch.
 
              She reaches for her knitting bag and empties its contents.
              One of her two, long, thin knitting needles is missing.
 
                                  EDNA
                               (rummaging all around
                                her)
                        Now where could that other needle
                        have gone?
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. STOREROOM / BATHROOM - NIGHT
 
              The room is a combination:  storing place mostly, there are
              two ample cupboards facing each other, each leaning against
              a wall, a mess of crates and boxes lying on top of each other
              behind a dusty curtain... and a toilet bowl, left from the
              days when this was just an oversized bathroom.  The toilet
              bowl is against the fourth wall, at an angle behind the door.
 
              The sound of the TV filters through the door as Harold,
              trousers down to his knees, sits on the toilet, sighing with
              relief as the first bout of diarrhea is over.
 
              He loosens his collar, wipes some sweat from his brow,
              reaches behind the toilet tank, and produces a hidden bottle
              of Whiskey.
 
              He unscrews the cap and takes a hardy swig.  He leans back
              and shut his eyes.
 
                                  HAROLD
                               (to himself)
                        Those poor little creatures...
 
              Another swig.  Some of the liquor spills over his chin and he
              wipes it with his sleeve.  His eyes wander around aimlessly,
              then focus on...

              THE DUSTY CURTAIN
 
              partially masking the mess of boxes and crates.  It seems to
              ripple subtly, moved by an ever so slight movement of air,
              perhaps someone's breath?
 
              Harold waits.  The curtains seem still.  Harold is about to
              relax when a brief, hollow noise is heard.
 
              Harold tries to locate the noise, but it's over before he can
              tell its source.  Pants around his ankles, he rises, shuffles
              to one of the closets.  It takes some courage to yank the
              door open, and the camera moves fast into a...
 
              FLAT CLOSEUP of empty shelves - nothing has touched them in
              a long time, except dust.
 
              Breathing relief, Harold pulls up his pants again, just
              enough to be able to hobble grotesquely to the dusty curtain.
              He rips it apart, stares at the odd assortment of boxes and
              crates - empty, lifeless, and uncannily menacing because of
              their lifelessness.
 
              Reassured, Harold gives the other closet a glance, almost
              decides against checking it - and then changes his mind, and
              stumbles, pants still around his ankles, towards it.
 
              Looks like this one hasn't been opened at all for a long
              time.  Harold tugs at the door - a creak, followed instantly
              by a musical stinger as a huge hand holding a meat cleaver
              rips into the shot, strikes Harold, imbedding the cleaver in
              his chest.
 
              Harold manages a half-scream that mixes incongruously with
              the laughter from the TV in the living room.  As the hand
              twists the cleaver, the scream becomes a raspy cough.
 
              Harold stumbles backwards and crashes to the floor.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
 
              Edna hears the crash.  She turns off the television.
 
                                  EDNA
                        Harold?
 
              No answer.  She gets up from the couch and goes to the
              bathroom door.  She listens and hears the noise of the toilet
              flushing and flushing, as if someone's hand never released
              the lever.

                                  EDNA
                               (rattling the door
                                knob)
                        Harold... what's taking you so
                        long in there?  You all right?
 
              She pushes against the door.  It doesn't budge.  She looks
              down and notices some kind of liquid seeping out from
              underneath the bathroom door.  She dips her fingers in it and
              sniffs.
 
                                  EDNA
                               (continuing)
                        Whiskey, I thought so.
 
              She goes over to a desk, opens a small drawer and finds a
              skeleton key.
 
              She hurries back to the bathroom/storeroom door, ready to
              insert the key.  To her shock, the door is now open a crack!
 
              For a moment, Edna is nonplussed.
 
                                  EDNA
                               (continuing)
                        Harold!
 
              She pushes the door - it swings open, revealing the open
              closets, the boxes and crates...
 
              INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
 
              Edna steps inside and inadvertently kicks the half-empty
              bottle of Whiskey.  She picks up the bottle while the
              flushing noise persists maddeningly.
 
              She turns toward the toilet, which is behind the door and
              screams at the sight of Harold sitting there.
 
              HAROLD
 
              pants down, like a grotesque dummy, blood drooling out of the
              corners of his mouth, the meat cleaver sticking out of his
              chest and one elbow stuck against the flushing handle.
 
              The Whiskey bottle falls from Edna's hand, hits the floor and
              shatters.
 
              Edna screams uncontrollably.
 
              From behind her a huge hand enters the flame and pierces the
              back of her head with the previously missing knitting needle.
              The needle is pushed out through her mouth, right at the
              camera.

              she gags on her own blood and slums out of frame.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. WORKING CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING
 
              A group ethnic children are playing stickball in the street,
              weatherworn two and three-family houses on either side of
              them.
 
              A red passenger van screeches around the corner and heads
              down the block, slowing down as it advances on the oblivious
              children.  The driver sounds the horn, warning of the van's
              approach.  Most of the children scatter, but a few don't,
              yelling and banging on the sides of the van as it passes.
 
              The van continues for a few yards then parallel parks in the
              first available space.
 
              The driver Chris...19, blond, attractive but intense...steps
              down and circles around to the passenger side where two
              others jump out.  They are Debbie...19, brown-haired,
              vivacious and healthy, the all-american cheerleader
              type...and Andy...slims, athletic and ruggedly handsome.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        Which one is it?
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (pointing)
                        It's the last house on the left.
                        She lives downstairs.
 
              Chris turns back to the van.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (calling through
                                window)
                        Hey Shelly!  Come on out and meet
                        your date.
 
                                  SHELLY'S VOICE
                               (from inside van)
                        Bring her to me!
 
              Chris looks back at Andy and Debbie for advice.
 
                                  ANDY
                               (shrugging his
                                shoulder)
                        What're you gonna do?
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

              Chris calls into the van once again.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        How about you two?  You coming?
 
              Two other voices shout back:
 
                                  VOICES
                               (in unison)
                        No!
 
              Chris throws up her hands in frustration, joining Andy and
              Debbie.  They cross the street abreast.
 
              CAMERA TRACKS in front of the three friends.  A rotund,
              ominous-looking figure in a hideous, ghostly white mask
              springs out from around the hidden side of the van.  The
              figure follows a safe distance behind the unsuspecting
              threesome, brandishing a knife.
 
              As they walk, Andy and Debbie are locked in each other's arms
              and they begin to kiss.  Chris looks at them and shakes her
              head.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        Sex, sex, sex.  You guys are
                        getting boring, you know that?
 
              Debbie breaks the kiss, feeling a little embarrassed.
 
                                  ANDY
                        So what would a weekend in the
                        country be without sex?
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (stern)
                        Cool it, Andy.
 
                                  ANDY
                               (apologetic)
                        I didn't mean it the way it
                        sounded...
 
                                  CHRIS
                        I know you didn't...
 
              Little by little, the masked figure advances from behind.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (to Andy and Debbie)
                        Look guys, I don't want to ruin
                        your weekend.  What happened to me
                        at the cottage happened a long time
                        ago and I think I've worked that out.
                        I'm all right now.
 
              The figure draws even closer raising the knife above his head.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (continuing)
                        I appreciate the fact that you
                        worry about me, but don't.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        Okay, we won't.  We'll just have
                        fun, all agreed?
 
              The masked figure rears back and plunges the knife into
              Andy's back.
 
                                  ANDY
                        Aaahhh!
 
              The rubber knife bends in half.  Andy, Debbie and Chris whirl
              around to face the assailant.
 
                                  ANDY
                               (continuing)
                        Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always
                        have to be such an asshole!
 
                                  SHELLY
                               (still wearing the
                                mask)
                        I beg your pardon, I'm not an
                        asshole.  I'm an actor.
 
                                  ANDY
                        Same thing.
 
              Chris and Debbie, in disgust, turn away and walk off.  Andy
              drops back to walk with Shelly.
 
                                  ANDY
                               (paternal)
                        Look Shelly, you're my roommate
                        and I like you... most of the
                        time.  But you gotta stop doing
                        these things.  Now, I set this
                        date up for you, didn't I?  So
                        don't embarrass me.  When you meet
                        this woman, just relax and be
                        yourself.

                                  SHELLY
                        Would you be yourself...
                               (ripping off mask)
                        ...if you looked this this?
 
              Shelly puts on a pair of unflattering prescription glasses.
              Although he has a pleasant face, Shelly is overweight, greasy-
              haired and unkempt.
 
              Chris and Debbie lead the way for Andy and Shelly up the
              porch steps, to the front door of a shabby, two-family house.
 
              Chris rings the bell.  Shelly takes a few steps back.  He
              mats down his unruly hair, tucks in his shirt and takes off
              his glasses.  He's ready.
 
              The door opens and a middle-aged Hispanic woman stands behind
              the outer screen door.
 
                                  MOTHER
                               (Spanish accent)
                        Yes?
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (friendly)
                        Hi, Mrs. Sanchez.  I'm Chris.
                        We've come to pick up Vera.
 
                                  MOTHER
                               (bruskly)
                        She's not going.
 
              She shuts the door in Chris' face.  The group stands there
              not knowing what to do next.  V.O.'s from inside the house
              they can hear Vera and her mother arguing in Spanish.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        What are they saying?
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        I don't know.  I flunked Spanish.
 
              They all turn to leave when suddenly the front door swings
              open.  This time Vera, knapsack over her shoulder, ready to
              go, comes out onto the porch.  She's a knockout...20, exotic,
              raven-haired beauty...in tight jeans.  They turn and stare at
              her.
 
                                  VERA
                               (forcing a smile)
                        Hi everybody, what're you looking
                        at.  Let's go.

              Shelly, intimidated by Vera's sexy good looks, steps behind
              Andy and slips the mask back over his face.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (to Vera)
                        Is everything okay?
 
                                  VERA
                        You know, just your basic old
                        fashioned mother problems.
                               (changing the subject)
                        So, where's my date?
 
              Shelly comes out from behind Andy.
 
                                  SHELLY
                               (sheepishly)
                        Hi.
 
                                  VERA
                               (letting her
                                disappointment show)
                        You're Shelly?
 
                                  SHELLY
                        I'm sorry.
 
              Andy angrily rips the mask off Shelly's face.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (looking across the
                                street)
                        Hey!  The van's on fire!
 
              EXT. VAN
 
              White smoke billows out of the van windows, engulfing the
              vehicle and the luggage tied to the top.
 
              The whole group rushes off the porch and races to the van.
              The first one there, Andy, opens the passenger side door and
              jumps in.  Chris runs around to the driver's side and does
              the same.
 
              INT. VAN
 
              Through thick, acrid smoke, Chili and her boyfriend, Chuck...
              Cheech and Chong lookalies...can be seen sitting in the back
              on the floor, each puffing away like crazy on a bong filled
              with Marijuana.  Each wears a stereo headset that is plugged
              into their own Sony Walkman portable cassette players.
 
              Andy and Chris looks at each other as if to say "I should
              have known."

                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING
 
              Chris' red van speeds along the empty rural highway through
              the lush New England countryside.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. VAN - MORNING
 
              Through the driver's side window, the wind blows in on Chris
              and tosses her flaxen hair as she drives.  Debbie sits on
              Andy's lap in the passenger seat - the only other seat in the
              van.
 
                                  ANDY
                        How much farther to the cottage?
 
                                  CHRIS
                        We could've been there already...
                               (looking at Debbie)
                        ...if some people didn't have to
                        go to the bathroom every five
                        minutes.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (defensive)
                        Oh yeah...well just hope that you
                        never get pregnant, 'cause all you
                        do all the time is piss!
 
              REAR OF THE VAN
 
              Chili and Chuck are sprawled out on the floor, taking
              inventory of their numerous joints and bags of Marijuana.
 
              Shelly sits cross-legged near the very back of the van,
              opposite Vera, who sits with her legs open.  Daydreaming, she
              gazes upward at the sky and treetops through the back window.
 
              Shelly can't stop staring at Vera, admiring her sexy body.
              Vera senses that Shelly is undressing her with his eyes and
              quickly turns her head around and catches him looking at her
              breasts.  Shelly averts his eyes in embarrassment and looks
              over at Chuck who lights up a joint, inhales and hands it
              Chili.
 
                                  SHELLY
                        Is that all you two are gonna do
                        this weekend...smoke dope?

                                  CHUCK
                        Why not, man?  Is there a law
                        against it?
 
                                  SHELLY
                               (persisting)
                        There's better things to do with
                        your life.
 
                                  CHUCK
                               (confused)
                        Like what?
 
                                  CHILI
                               (inhaling)
                        I can't think of anything.
 
              She offers the joint to Shelly.  He declines.  Chili offers
              it to Vera.
 
                                  VERA
                        Sure, why not.
 
              Vera comes forward on her hands and knees, reaching out for
              the joint.  As she does, she inadvertently thrusts her
              shapely rear end almost into Shelly's face.  Shelly makes no
              attempt to retreat from it.  Actually he rather enjoys it.
 
                                  VERA
                               (as she draws on the
                                joint)
                        Is this stuff any good?
 
                                  CHUCK
                        Home grown, man!  Of course it's
                        good!
 
                                  CHILI
                        And it's good for you, too.
                        Strictly organic.  No
                        preservatives, man.
 
              Andy sniffs at the air around him filled with the aroma of
              good grass.
 
                                  ANDY
                        Hey, let's share the wealth with
                        those less fortunate up front here.
 
              Vera passes the joint to him and sits back down across from
              Shelly.
 
              Shelly is rummaging through a small black suitcase. It's
              contents are concealed from Vera's view.

                                  VERA
                               (curious)
                        What d'ya got in there?
 
                                  SHELLY
                               (very secretive)
                        My whole world.
 
                                  VERA

                                  SHELLY
                        Stick around and you'll see.
 
              Vera turns away and looks out the back window.
 
              We can hear the faint sounds of sirens.
 
              EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
 
              In the distance, two police cruisers, with lights flashing,
              in hot pursuit.

                        Yes, man!
 
              They all look at one another, perplexed.  Vera is amused.
              Without a word and simultaneously, Chili and Chuck begin to
              stuff loose grass and joints into their mouths.

                                  CHUCK
                               (mouth full)

                        Aw shit!
 
              He starts to eat.  Vera joins in, too.  The police sirens
              grow louder.
 
              EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
 
              The cruisers advance.

              Andy grabs another bag and hands it to Chris.

                        driving.
 
              Andy turns to Debbie and offers up the cellophane bag.
 
                                  ANDY

                        No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
 
              The sirens seem to be getting closer.  Chili leans in behind
              Chris.

              The van speeds up, but so do the police cruisers, even
              narrowing the gap.

              Chili, Chuck, Andy and Vera's cheeks are filled to capacity
              with dope.  Their faces are turning green.  Still they
              continue to stuff in more at a frantic pace.

              Shelly holds his black suitcase tightly to his chest as he
              watches out the back window with concern.

              To appease everybody, Shelly begins to nibble ever so
              slightly on the marijuana out of Vera's hand.

                        They're too close.  I gotta pull
                        the van over.  Hurry up and
                        swallow!  Everybody just be cool.

              Chris pulls the van to the side of the road.  She sticks her
              head out to watch for the approaching cruisers.  Much to her
              surprise and everyone else's, both police cars zoom by the
              van without stopping.

                        I'm gonna be sicker than all of

              She slowly unbuttons her blouse.  Everyone looks at her,
              puzzled.  Chuck raises his head.

              Her fingers reach inside her bra -- but instead of freeing
              her breasts, she pulls out a good size plastic bag of
              marijuana.  Chuck's mouth drops open.

              The two police cruisers make a sharp right into the small Mom
              'n Pop store parking lot and SCREECH to a halt.
 
              A small group of curious onlookers congregate at the front
              entrance of the store.
 
              The cruiser lights continue to flash red and blue as the
              Police Officers step out of their vehicles.
 
              The Officers order the onlookers to "go home" then enter the
              store.
 
              Chris' red van approaches down the highway.

              CHRIS' MOVING POV
 
              A team of Medics carry out two heavy body bags from the store.
 
              Chris watches with morbid fascination, fueling her anxieties.
 
              Debbie is also looking out the window at this unpleasant
              scene.  She turns to see Chris and reads the concern on her
              face.

              Chris turns her attention back to the highway and drives on.

              ABEL... 72, long stringy white hair and whiskered, skinny in
              baggy clothes, weathered stern face.  Like a lone star, he
              ambles down the lonely highway, dragging a duffle bag.
 
              The SOUND of a vehicle approaching in the distance...
 
              Abel sticks out his right thumb in a hitchhiking stance.  He
              affects a smile and looks toward the vehicle down the road.

              The sun pours in through the windshield.  Debbie shades her
              eyes to get a better look at the figure up ahead.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        Would you look at that!  I've
                        never seen a senior citizen
                        hitchhiker before.
 
              The others in the back come forward to look.

                        break.  Pick 'im up.

              Shelly reacts very emotionally to the suggestion.

                        That scarecrow?  Can't you tell

                        Not us!  He's really creepy.
 
              The van is now upon the aged hitchhiker.  He flashes a smile
              at them:  plaintive, shy, and yet somehow ominous.

                        He looks just like my grandfather,
                        man.  Let's give him a ride.

              The van screeches to a halt and backs up to Abel.  The side
              door slides open and Abel is lifted into the back.
 
              The van pulls away.

              Abel settles into the back next to Shelly who studies the old
              traveller with both curiosity and trepidation.
 
              Chris adjusts her rearview mirror to include Abel.
 
              Abel nods "hello" to one and all.  They nod back.
 
                                  ABEL
                               (in an eloquent
                                soothing voice)
                        You are, all of you, very kind and
                        generous young people to lend a
                        helping hand to a tired, old man.
                        Thank you very much.  Perhaps I
                        can repay the kindness.
 
              The civilized speaking-manner of the shabby-looking stranger
              calms the layer of fear that any might have had.

                                  ABEL
                               (continuing)
                        My name is Abel.  And I am my
                        brother's keeper.
 
                                  SHELLY

                                  SHELLY
                        I mean, is there any place in
                        particular where we can drop you
                        off?
 
                                  ABEL
                        Drop me off?  How do you mean?
 
              Shelly's suspicions return and he glances from Vera to Debbie
              and Andy.  Andy shrugs his shoulders.
 
              Abel reaches into his dusty dufflebag and pulls out a very
              small bundle wrapped in a scrap of cloth.
 
              Chris watches via the rearview mirror.  Her expression is
              wary.
 
              Abel unwraps the object and places it in front of Shelly's
              face.
 
                                  ABEL

                        Look what His Grace has brought me.
 
              Shelly looks down at a the small, slimy, white oblong thing.

                        What is that?
 
                                  ABEL
                        I found this today.  There were
                        other pieces of the body lying
                        there, but I believe "he" wanted
                        me to have this...
 
                                  SHELLY
                               (gasping)
                        That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!

                                  ABEL
                        "He" wanted me to warn you.
                               (evangelical)
                        Look at this, all of you!
 
              He holds the eyeball out for each to view.  They shrink back
              away from him, cringing at the sight.
 
              The eyeball is reflected in the rearview mirror.  Chris is
              becoming quite upset.
 
                                  ABEL
                               (continuing)
                        See with your own eyes what I have
                        seen.  Runaway!  Go back to where

              The van comes to an abrupt stop.  The side door opens and the
              old man is practically tossed out.
 
              On the ground, Abel yells after the van as it speeds away.
 
                                  ABEL
                        I warned you!

              The van is parked on the shoulder of the highway.
 
              Chris leans against a tree, her arms crossed over her chest.
              She looks towards the woods, waiting.
 
              In front of her face, two sneakered feet pass by.  It's Andy,
              walking on his hands.
 
              Vera stretches her arms over her head then drops her torso
              and arms to the ground, bent over.

                        Some their arms....

                        And some nothing at all.

              From out of the woods, Debbie appears.  She zips up the front
              of her jeans and approaches the others.  Chris and Vera
              applaud.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        I can't help it.
 
              Smiling, Chris puts her arms around Debbie's shoulder and the
              two walk toward the van.
 
              From seemingly out of nowhere, the ROAR of MOTORCYCLES is
              suddenly upon them.
 
              The group whisks around to find three souped-up motorcycles
              bearing down on them, navigated by a manacing-looking TRIO.
 
              The motorcycles head straight for them.  In a panic, the
              group scatters.  Dust swirls as the Motorcyclists veer away
              from the group and the van just in time to avert a collision.
 
              As the dust settles, the group picks themselves off the
              ground.
 
                                  CHRIS

              The others have assumed their respective positions.  However,
              the jovial atmosphere has degenerated due to the unsettling
              series of incidents.
 
              Long faces and silence prevails.
 
              Then, up ahead just off the road, a pleasant surprise, for

              Chris slows down the van.  The group quickly moves forward
              and peers out the front windshield.  One by one, a smile
              crosses each dour face.

              EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
 
              As the van passes the powerless Cyclists, the side door
              swings open and the passenger window rolls down.  The group
              sticks their heads out and jeers and applauds.
 
              INT. VAN - DAY
 
              Chris turns on the radio -- Rock 'n Roll MUSIC blares as the
              lighthearted atmosphere returns.
 
              EXT. HIGHWAY
 
              Jauntily, the van zips down the highway.

              coming up over the hilly highway.
 
              The van turns off onto the dirt road and makes its way
              through a wooded landscape along a winding trail.  Sun
              dapples through the trees.

              EXT. LAKESIDE COTTAGE - DAY
 
              An overgrown driveway meanders among oak trees towards a
              rustic two-story house.  The oak trees have been there long
              before the house was built -- their heavy branches hang low,
              like tired arms, almost blocking the driveway.
 
              The house has an elevated porch and curtained windows.  It is
              in relatively decent condition though weatherbeaten and
              creates from the start an impression of family history.
 
              There is ample parking space before the house. On the left
              side of the driveway as one approaches, some thirty yards
              diagonally across from the house, there is a tall red barn
              with a hayloft equipped with a block and tackle (to bring up
              the bales of hay into the loft's square window).

              To the right of the house is an outhouse with a heartshaped
              venthole in its wooden door.
 
              To the left of the house is a large lake with a knotty old
              dock and a small tree-covered island in the middle.  The
              whole area is surrounded by a lush landscape.
 
              The SOUND of a VEHICLE approaching...
 
              The CAMERA reveals this serene, idyllic panorama and PICKS UP
              Chris' van as it bumps along the dirt road and slows down to
              a crawl to pass over a creaky, dilapidated wooden bridge that
              runs over a dried-up stream.
 
              INT. HOUSE
 
              The CAMERA peers OVER-THE-SHOULDER of an UNIDENTIFIABLE
              FIGURE as he moves from one living room window to the other,
              watching the van as it sweeps under the low branches towards
              the house.
 
              EXT. HOUSE
 
              The van comes to a stop.  Chris jumps out and looks towards
              the house.  A collection of memories posses her for a moment
              before she reaches for the knotted rope and unties the tarp
              covering the bulk of the baggage on top.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (loud so the others
                                can hear)
                        Let's bring in the luggage first,
                        then I'll give you a tour of the
                        house and the barn and then we can
                        hang out at the lake... All right?
 
              No response.  Just the distant SOUND of FEET RUNNING and
              LAUGHTER.
 
              Chris walks around to the other side of the van and finds the
              doors left wide open and no one about.  She turns to see her
              friends running towards the lake, unable to resist the
              splendor of the shimmering water and sun dappled landscape.
 
              Debbie turns back and gestures for Chris to join them.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        Come on down!
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (shaking her head)
                        You go ahead...

              In the background, behind Chris, the Shadowy Figure, OUT OF
              FOCUS, appears behind a curtain in the living room.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (to Debbie)
                        I'm gonna take my bags into the
                        house first and look around.
 
              Chris turns toward the house.  The Figure disappears from
              view.  Chris grabs a piece of baggage in each hand and
              innocently strides up the path and porch steps to the front
              door.
 
              It has been a while since she has last visited the family
              country home and she is actually pleased to have this moment
              to herself.
 
              She rifles through her handbag, comes up with the keys and
              reaches for the doorknob to find that the door is already
              open, ever so slightly.  A look of concern flashes across
              Chris' face.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (continuing)
                        Hello?
 
              Only the distant SOUNDS of her friends by the lake can be
              heard.
 
              Cautiously, Chris pushes the door.  Creaking, it opens wide.
              She hesitates a moment then takes a step inside.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (hearing a noise)
                        Who's there?
 
              From out of nowhere, a hand grabs Chris by the neck and pulls
              her OUT OF FRAME.  She SCREAMS!
 
              Then the SOUNDTRACK becomes coldly SILENT...
 
                                                       CUT TO:

              Pinned up against the wall, Chris is being embraced and
              kissed passionately by a MAN whose face is not yet visible.
 
              Resisting, Chris pushes him off.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        Derek... stop.

                                  DEREK
                        Why?
 
              DEREK is 23, tall, dark and virile.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        You know what I've been through.
                        Don't ever scare me like that.
 
                                  DEREK
                        I'm sorry.  I just wanted to
                        surprise you.  What can I say?
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (with a smile)
                        You can say... "Hello, how are
                        you?"... for starters.
 
                                  DEREK
                               (genuinely)
                        Hello.  How are you?
 
              He pulls her towards him to kiss her again.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (moving away)
                        You haven't changed a bit.  Always
                        so sure of yourself.  Even when we
                        were kids, when you wanted
                        something, nothing could stop you.
 
                                  DEREK
                        Is that so bad?
 
                                  CHRIS
                        I don't know.
 
                                  DEREK
                        You're irresistible.  I lose
                        control.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        Just slow down.  Let me get to
                        know you again.  Let me get to
                        know this place again.
 
                                  DEREK
                        Okay.  There's a whole weekend
                        ahead of us.  There's time.
 
              Chris embraces Derek.  Behind them, passing the porch
              windows, OUT OF FOCUS, is the shadowy figure of JASON.
              Neither Chris nor Derek is aware of the presence.

                                  CHRIS
                               (breaking the embrace)
                        Come outside and help me with the
                        bags.
 
              The turn and head for the front door.  Jason's figure moves
              away from the windows, out of sight.

                        I'll get the bags off the top.
                        You get the ones inside.
 
              Chris moves around to the opposite side.  The sliding door
              which was previously wide open is now closed.
 
                                  CHRIS

                                loud)
                        This door was open just a minute
                        ago, wasn't it?

                                of the van)
                        What?
 
                                  CHRIS
                        Nothing.
 
              The SOUND of the others thrashing about in the lake can be
              heard as Chris reaches for the handle and whisks the door
              aside.  Instinctively, she braces herself, but nothing jumps
              out at her.  Annoyed with herself for being so suspicious and
              jumpy, Chris just leans in and grabs for the first bag she
              sees.
 
              A HAND springs INTO FRAME and wraps around Chris' wrist.  She
              gasps and jumps back.
 
              Shelly sticks his head out the side of the van.
 
                                  SHELLY
                        That's my bag.  I'll take care of
                        it.

                                  CHRIS
                        What're you doing in there?  Why
                        aren't you down at the lake with
                        the others.
 
                                  SHELLY
                        'Cause they're skinny-dipping and

              Pitch black save for a slice of sunlight from an elevated
              basement window.  The door swings open.  Silhouetted in the
              doorway are Chili and Chuck just come from the lake, drenched
              and dripping in their wet clothing.

                        That's the way it is, man.
                        Cellars are dark.

                        And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin'
                        down there either.
 
              Chili flicks a wall switch next to her.  A naked light bulb
              springs to life, glowing dimly.
 
                                  CHILI
                        There's nothin' to be afraid of.
 
              She takes Chuck by the hand and leads him down the stairs.
              Their sneakers, sodden with water, squeak and squish as they
              go.  Water drips from their hair and clothes, forming little
              puddles that follow their every step.
 
              The basement is overrun with cobwebs and spiderwebs.  Rusted
              gardening tools, broken bicycle parts and boxes of old toys
              are strewn helter-skelter.  An old washer and dryer sit just
              to the left of the electrical fusebox.

                                  CHILI
                               (continuing)
                        Gimme your threads, man.
 
              Chuck pulls off his shirt and hands it to Chili.  She rings
              it out onto the floor creating a pool of water under the
              fusebox.
 
              As Chuck zips down his pants, Chili turns on the dryer.
              Annoyingly, the dryer RATTLES and SHAKES.
 
              Suddenly the light bulb goes off, plunging the twosome into
              near darkness.
 
              FOREBODING MUSIC enters the SOUNDTRACK...
 
                                  CHUCK

              But yet, the dryer CLATTERS on.
 
              From over by the stairs, the SOUND of a METAL OBJECT being
              kicked against the door.
 
              Chili and Chuck whirl around to look.
 
              A rusty old roller skate bounces down the stairs and hits
              bottom with a CLUNK.

                                  CHRIS
                        This was my bedroom.  It's yours
                        for the weekend.
 
              Chris walks over to the windows and separates the curtains,
              flooding the room with light.  She opens the windows -- a
              cool breeze blows in.
 
              Debbie surveys the cheerful room with antique furniture that
              includes a folding.  Japanese-style dressing curtain.  But
              there is one important element missing in this bedroom...
              there's no bed.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        Uh, Chris... I don't mean to be
                        picky, but... where do we sleep?
 
              With an impish smile, Chris goes over to the closet and pulls
              out a crumpled mass of netting.  She hands it to Debbie.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (perplexed)
                        What's this?
 
                                  CHRIS
                        Your bed.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        A hammock?
 
                                  CHRIS
                        Have you ever made love in a
                        hammock?
 
              Chris exits, closing the door behind her.

                                  DEBBIE
                               (envisioning the
                                pleasant
                                possibilities)
                        Hmmm... why not?
 
              Debbie begins to unravel the nylon mesh when suddenly, a gust
              of wind topples over the Japanese dressing curtain.  It hits
              the floor with a sharp SLAP.  At the same exact moment, the
              door is kicked open with a BANG, SLAMMING against the
              opposite wall.
 
              Debbie jumps.  It's Andy.  He squeezes through the door with
              the bulky baggage.
 
                                  ANDY
                               (looking around)
                        Where's the bed?
 
              With the back of his foot, Andy kicks the door to close it.
              An instant before the door slams shut, we SEE a fleeting yet
              ominous, glimpse of Jason behind Andy in the hallway.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
 
              Chris in CLOSE SHOT, looks around the room, concerned about
              what she sees.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (calling out)
                        Derek, come in here!
 
              WIDER SHOT
 
              including the whole room.  The bed is a mess as if someone
              had slept in it recently, the closets are open -- hangers on
              the floor, some linen strewn about, the dresser drawers are
              pulled out and left hanging.
 
              Derek comes into the room carrying a box full of wooden
              paddles with little rubber balls attached by a long elastic
              thread.
 
                                  DEREK
                        Look what I found.  Remember these?
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (her attention
                                focused elsewhere)
                        Did you stay here last night?

                                  DEREK
                               (looking around)
                        No.  I got here just before you
                        did.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        Somebody was in here.
 
                                  DEREK
                        Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
 
                                  CHRIS
                        I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a
                        little strange to you?
 
              Chris begins straightening up the room, pushing in the
              drawers, etc.
 
                                  DEREK
                        Don't get paranoid.  I'm sure your
                        parents left it this way last time
                        they were here.  You know how
                        messy your father is.  If there
                        was a phone here, I'd call them up
                        right now.
 
              Derek moves over to help Chris make the bed.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        You have an answer for everything,
                        don't you?
 
              Derek shrugs his shoulders.
 
                                  DEREK
                               (gentle but firm)
                        I just think that it's about time
                        you stopped looking over your
                        shoulder, always expecting there's
                        someone coming after you.  That's
                        no way to live.
 
              Chris looks at Derek thoughtfully, but unconvinced.  They
              finish making the bed in silence.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. LAKE / COTTAGE - DAY
 
              Several six packs of empty beer bottles line a picnic table
              which is further cluttered with half-eaten sandwiches and the
              usual array of picnic goodies.

              Shelly and Vera sits across from each other, in the midst of
              a beer chugging contest.  Derek, Andy and Chuck sit on either
              side Shelly, encouraging him to victory.  Chris, Chili and
              Debbie, on either side of Vera, do likewise.
 
              Vera downs her next bottle with apparent ease.  Shelly balks
              as another beer is thrust in front of him.
 
                                  SHELLY
                               (nauseous)
                        No more... I can't!
 
                                  ANDY
                        Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
 
              Shelly relents and suffers the beer as it goes down.  The
              accomplishment is met with a pat on the back.
 
              Vera, too, hesitates for a moment then chugs her beer, this
              time more slowly and with a degree of difficulty.
 
              Tipsy, Shelly rises to his feet.
 
                                  SHELLY
                               (as if in control)
                        If you'll all please excuse me...
 
              Shelly picks up his small black suitcase and walks off on
              wobbly legs.
 
                                  ANDY
                               (yelling after him)
                        How could you let her beat you?
 
              SHELLY
 
              grabs his mouth and runs past the house into the outhouse,
              slamming the door behind him.
 
              The SOUNDS of Shelly vomiting can be heard.
 
              INT. OUTHOUSE
 
              Leaning over the hole, Shelly wipes his mouth with his
              sleeve.  Weakened and defeated, he sits down and leans his
              head back against the wall, closing his eyes.
 
              An OMINOUS TONE enters the SOUNDTRACK...
 
              From behind Shelly, the CAMERA MOVES past him and LOOKS OUT
              from the heart-shaped venthole carved in the door.

              From this distant vantage point, WE CAN SEE up to a second-
              floor window where a shadowy figure (Jason) looks down from
              behind a sheer curtain.
 
              SHELLY
 
              opens his eyes and listens to the others by the lake, having
              fun without him.  He stands up and OUT OF FRAME.
 
              EXT. OUTHOUSE
 
              Shelly comes out of the outhouse.  Alone with his black
              suitcase, he starts for the front door of the house.
 
              The OMINOUS TONE returns to the SOUNDTRACK...
 
              The CAMERA CRANES UP to the second-floor bedroom window where
              moments before the shadowy figure stood watching.  The figure
              is now gone from the window.  Only the curtains rustle in the
              breeze.
 
              The SOUND of the front door SLAMMING.  Shelly is inside.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. HOUSE - DAY
 
              CAMERA is behind Shelly as he ascends the spiral staircase.
              Halfway up, he HEARS a LOUD THUD.  Pausing to listen, he
              turns his face around, right into CAMERA.  He hears nothing
              further and continues up the stairs.
 
              When he reaches the landing, he HEARS SCREAMING coming from
              the lake.  He rushes into the bedroom which faces the water.
 
              INT. BEDROOM - DAY
 
              It's Andy and Debbie's bedroom where the hammock is now set
              up, draped with a bedspread.  Shelly looks out on the lake.
 
              SHELLY'S POV
 
              The SCREAMING is nothing more than playful activity.
 
              Suddenly, the SOUND of a window in the room SLAMMING shut.
              Startled, Shelly whips around to see the window beside the
              Japanese dressing curtain now closed.  Dust around the window
              has been unsettled.  The Japanese curtain wavers.  Shelly
              cannot see behind it.
 
              He edges over to the curtain and flings it aside.  There's
              nothing there.  He exits.

              INT. HALLWAY - DAY
 
              He walks to his room at the far end of the corridor and
              pushes on the door to open it.  It doesn't budge.  Leading
              with his shoulder, he bashes into the door.  This time it
              gives.  Shelly stumbles off-balance into the room (this is
              the same room which looks directly down on the outhouse)!
 
              A HIGH-PITCHED FOREBODING NOTE enters the SOUNDTRACK...
 
              Shelly takes a long look back down the hallway as he closes
              the door.
 
              CAMERA HOLDS for a moment on the closed door as the MUSICAL
              NOTE INTENSIFIES...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. LAKE / COTTAGE - DAY
 
              A chilling, bloodcurdling SCREAM, from inside the house,
              shatters the calm by the lake.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        What was that?
 
                                  ANDY
                               (looking around at
                                the others)
                        Where's Shelly?
 
                                  VERA
                        I haven't seen him.

                        Come on!...
 
              He leads the others in a race towards the house and up the
              porch steps.

              INT. HOUSE - DAY
 
              The group barrels into the house and assembles in the living
              room at the base of the stairs.
 
                                  DEREK
                               (calling out)
                        Shelly!  Where are you?!

                                  CHRIS
                               (shouting up the
                                stairs)
                        Are you all right, Shelly?
 
              Silence.
 
                                  DEREK
                        Let's spread out and check all the
                        rooms.  Outside, too.
                               (to Chris)
                        You stay with me.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        No.  I can look around by myself.
                        I'll take the upstairs.
 
              The group disperses.  The CAMERA STAYS with Chris.  She heads
              up the spiral staircase to the second-floor landing.
 
              INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY
 
              She looks both ways down the corridor and sees Shelly's
              closed bedroom door at the end of the hall.  She approaches,
              tries the knob and pushes.  The door is stuck.  She kicks it
              open with her foot.  The door slams against the wall of the
              room.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (before going in)
                        Shelly...?
 
              The room is in order.  Chris takes a few hesitant steps
              inside, looking all around.  There's no trace of him.
 
              There are two closets in the room.  Chris reaches out for the
              nearest one and pulls open the door.
 
              MUSICAL STINGER...
 
              SHELLY
 
              An axe imbedded in his head, and bleeding profusely, falls
              forward into Chris' arms.  She SHRIEKS as Shelly's lifeless
              body slides down her arm and slumps to the floor.  Chris
              recoils, SCREAMING in horror.
 
              DEREK AND VERA
 
              burst into the room.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (sobbing)
                        He's dead... he's dead...

                                  VERA

                                turning her away)
                        Don't look!  Let's just get the
                        hell out of here.
 
              Andy and Debbie, followed by Chili and Chuck, rush into the
              room.  They react accordingly, except Andy.  He is curiously
              unaffected by the gruesome sight.  He bends down over Shelly.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        Don't touch him!
 
              Undaunted, Andy places his hand on Shelly's stomach... and
              tickles him.  Shelly springs to life, giggling uncontrollably.

                        Get up, you creep.
 
              Shelly looks up at the angry mob.

                               (a little worried)
                        I guess I fooled you, huh?

                        Why you little bastard!  I'll kill
                        you!
 
              Chris jumps Shelly and pummels him with punches.  The fake
              axe falls from his head as Shelly fends off Chris.  Derek
              grabs her and pulls her off.
 
                                  DEREK
                        Leave him alone.  He doesn't know
                        any better.
 
                                  SHELLY
                        It was a joke... just a joke... I
                        didn't mean to...

                        You never mean to.
 
              Vera glares disdainfully at Shelly.  She finds him pitiful.

              The barn doors are wide open.
 
              The SOUND of an ENGINE CHOKING and SPUTTERING to life.  A
              rusted-out, old Volkswagen Beetle CHUGS out of the barn.
              Vera is driving.
 
              Cleaned all of his makeup and blood, Shelly races out of the
              house and runs alongside the VW, peering in at Vera.
 
                                  SHELLY
                        Let me go with you!  I gotta get
                        away from here, too.
 
              Without a word, Vera zooms off, abandoning Shelly.  But when
              she reaches the bridge, she brakes and opens the passenger
              door.  Elated, Shelly bolts to the car and jumps in.

              packs of beer, bottles of cheap champagne and assorted

              Vera sneers at the woman and looks down the aisles for
              Shelly.  She finds him leafing through a magazine rack.
 
                                  VERA
                        Shelly... I need some money.
                        Throw me your wallet.
 
              Shelly digs into his pocket, comes up with the wallet and
              tosses it over to Vera.

              She reaches up to catch it, but it hits the side of her hand
              and drops to the floor.
 
              Vera bends down to pick it up, but someone beats her to it.
              A black hand with rings on each finger scoops the wallet up
              first.
 
              FOX... a Black woman outfitted in skin-tight black leather...
              holds the wallet.  Vera and she have an immediate and mutual
              dislike for each other.
 
              Flanking Fox, on either side, is ALI... a strapping Black man
              with a full set of gold teeth... and LOCO... sporting a
              bandana, gold earrings and leather jacket.

              in with on the road earlier.
 
              As Fox and Vera stare at each other, Shelly comes up behind
              Vera.

                        mine...
 
              Ali and Loco leer at Shelly and surround him.  They lift him
              off the ground, each grabbing an arm.

                        I'll take that, now.
 
              Fox continues rummaging through the wallet.  She pulls out a
              prophylactic packet.

              regains his feet.

              Fox and Loco strut deliberately towards the VW.
 
              Vera throws the car into gear and hits the gas pedal.  The

              Loco, sending him and his cycle flying off the road.
 
              As Vera regains control of the VW, Ali drops back next to Fox
              behind the car.
 
              Ali hands Fox the chain and signals for her to move up the
              passenger side.
 
              INT. VW
 
              Shelly watches as Fox moves up alongside.
 
                                  VERA
                        Got any good ideas?
 
                                  SHELLY
                        Maybe.
 
              He reaches into the back seat and pulls out a bottle of
              champagne.
 
                                  VERA
                        This is no time to celebrate!

                        Just keep your eyes on the road.

              Waving the chain menacingly, Fox pulls up alongside Shelly's
              window.
 
              Quickly, Shelly unravels the seal and shakes up the champagne
              bottle.
 
                                  VERA
                        What're you doing?

                        No time to explain.  Just listen.
                        When I yell "stop," you jam on the
                        brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?

                               (pleased with
                                Shelly's initiative)
                        You're the boss.
 
              FOX
 
              hauls back with the chain and rams it through Shelly's
              window, barely missing her mark.
 
              SHELLY
 
              shakes the bottle as he pries up the plastic cork.
 
              FOX
 
              rears back with the chain and readies herself to strike a
              second time.
 
              Shelly aims the champagne bottle out the window.  With a
              final flick of his thumb the cork flies out and strikes Fox
              in the face -- a direct hit!
 
              Fox reaches for her face and falls backwards off her cycle.

                        Stop the car!  Now!!
 
              Vera jams on the brakes.
 
              EXT. VW
 
              The car comes to a screeching halt.

              ANGLE ON ALI
 
              shocked!  Unable to stop in time or swerve out of the way,
              his cycle runs right up the back of the car and flips over on
              top of him.
 
              The VW shifts into first gear and proceeds unimpeded.  Left
              in its wake are three motorcyclists sprawled out on the
              highway.

              EXT. COTTAGE / BARN - DAY
 
              The sun casts an orange glow over the landscape as it slowly
              sinks in the West.
 
              Andy is at one end of the porch working out -- strenuous
              calisthenics.  Chili and Chuck sit together on the porch
              swing, opposite Andy, sharing a joint.  They watch Andy's awe-
              inspiring performance as they rock back and forth.
 
                                  CHUCK
                        Maybe we should do some exercise.
 
                                  CHILI
                        This is all the exercise I need...
 
              She raises the joint to her mouth and tokes on it.
 
              In the background, Debbie comes jogging out of the woods,
              over to the small bridge and towards the house.  Behind her,
              the war-torn Volkswagen Beetle winds its way down the dirt
              road.  Debbie turns and jogs backwards as the car approaches.
 
              Chili, Chuck and Andy see the car coming. The damage is
              evident even from a distance.  They run from the porch as the
              VW passes Debbie and comes to a halt just in front of the
              barn.
 
              Chili, Chuck, Andy and Debbie surround the car.  Chuck puts
              his hand through the frame of the windshield and touches
              Vera's face.

                                  CHUCK
                        Where's your windshield, man?
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        What happened to you guys?  Are
                        you all right?
 
                                  ANDY
                        The question is... is the beer all
                        right?
 
              Shelly and Vera grab the bags and get out of the car.  They
              hand the packages to Chili and Chuck.
 
                                  VERA
                        We had a slight misunderstanding
                        with that motorcycle gang...
                               (she puts her arm
                                around Shelly)
                        ... but Shelly made them see the
                        error of their ways.
 
                                  SHELLY
                               (heroically)
                        It was nothing.
 
              Together, Shelly and Vera head for the house.  Andy and
              Debbie linger by the car.
 
              BARN
 
              Through the musty darkness, a HULKING HAND reaches out and
              stealthily pushes open the creaky barn door.  It's Jason.  He
              peeks through the crack and watches the group.
 
              DEREK AND CHRIS
 
              come running out of the house.  Derek is dumbfounded at the
              sight of his abused and battered car.
 
                                  DEREK
                        My beautiful car!  What'd you do
                        to it?!
 
              Vera and Shelly pass him on their way to the porch.

                               (hanging Derek the
                                keys)
                        We're really sorry, but it wasn't
                        our fault.

                                  SHELLY
                        A few minor repairs and it'll be
                        as good as new.
 
              Derek runs up to his car.  Chris follows.  Shelly and Vera go
              inside the house.  Chili and Chuck follow behind, carrying
              the packages in.
 
              The barn door slowly closes, unseen by anyone.
 
              DEREK
 
              examines the injuries sustained by his car.
 
                                  DEREK
                        This is too painful to look at.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        Why don't we drive over to the
                        cove and watch the sunset.  It'll
                        mellow you out.
 
              Derek considers it for a moment.
 
                                  DEREK
                        Might be nice to get away from
                        these crazy friends of yours.
 
              They jump into the car.  The CAMERA PANS with the VW as it
              drives off, revealing Andy and Debbie leaning against a tree,
              kissing.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        Why don't we go take a swim?
 
                                  ANDY
                        I don't know...
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (seductively)
                        We'd be all alone.  We could do
                        anything we wanted and nobody
                        would see.
 
                                  ANDY
                        Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
 
              He grabs Debbie by the hand and runs with her towards the
              lake.  As they run past the van, Debbie breaks away from Andy.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        You go ahead.  I'm gonna get a
                        blanket.

              Andy continues to the lake, walking on his hands when he
              reaches the dock.
 
              VAN
 
              Debbie slides open the side door and crawls inside.
 
              OMINOUS MUSIC invades the SOUNDTRACK...
 
              A pair of DARK BOOTED FEET approach furtively.
 
              Debbie's rear end is practically sticking out as the boots
              sneak around the back of the van and edge their way towards
              her.
 
              Abruptly, Debbie backs down out of the vehicle, blanket in
              hand, and scampers away without seeing the prowler.
 
              PROWLER
 
              CAMERA TILTS UP from the boots to reveal... Ali, the Black
              motorcyclist.  He's carrying an empty gas can and a siphon.
              His eyes scan the area.  There's no one on sight -- Debbie is
              already down by the lake.
 
              He signals with his hands and out from the bushes come Loco
              and Fox.  They scurry over to the van and duck down next to
              Ali who is unscrewing the van's gas cap.
 
                                  FOX
                        Maybe we shouldn't do this, Ali.
 
                                  LOCO
                        We gotta even the score, don't we?
 
                                  ALI
                               (to Fox)
                        Nobody's gonna get hurt, baby.
 
              Ali sticks the siphon down into the fuel tank and lays the
              gas can on the ground below it.  Loco tries to grab the
              siphon from Ali.
 
                                  LOCO
                               (over anxious)
                        Let me do it.
 
                                  ALI
                               (authoritative)
                        I know what I'm doing.
 
              Fox's attention is drawn to the barn as her cohorts continue
              with the task at hand.

              BARN
 
              Fox cautiously pulls open one of the two doors.  It CREAKS
              loudly.  She stops and looks around to see if anyone has
              heard -- the coast is clear.  She slips into the barn and
              pulls the door closed behind her.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. BARN - DUSK
 
              Spears of fading sunlight, thick with dust, cut across the
              musty interior.
 
              Fox scans the premises.  Her face lights up with the smile of
              a child in a toy store trying to decide which area to explore
              first.
 
              This is your typical barn with a variety of heavy duty tools,
              some rusting; saw horses; wooden benches and ladders; a horse
              stall; haybins, haystacks and a second floor hayloft; and,
              several storage rooms.
 
              With the fascination of a street kid who has probably never
              seen the inside of a barn, Fox wanders through the rustic
              interior.  In her high-heeled boots, she has trouble
              maneuvering around on the muddy, hay covered floor.
 
              As she approaches the toolshed, one of her heels sticks deep
              into a sticky patch of mud and she falls forward off-balance.
              To stop her fall, Fox reaches out for the toolshed handle.
              She grabs it but the rotting old door tears off its hinges
              and she topples to the ground -- her face landing inches away
              from a pitchfork's prongs aiming upwards at her.
 
              Her eyes focus on the sharp teeth of the pitchfork.  Alarmed
              by the close call, Fox tosses the implement away, gets up and
              dusts herself off.
 
              Looking skyward to the loft area, Fox moves over to its
              ladder and starts up.  The ladder quivers as she ascends,
              apparently dislodging a bale of hay at the top and sending it
              crashing towards her.  (Or, was it Jason?)  Fox swings her
              body out of the way just in time.  The bale whizzes by her
              and hits the barn floor with a THUD.
 
              She continues up the ladder and disappears through the loft
              flooring.

              Ali and Loco have just completed filling up one gas can and
              are starting to fill the second one.  Ali sticks the siphon
              in his mouth and draws on it.  The gas begins to flow as Loco
              shoves the container into place to catch all the fluid.
 
              The SOUND of Fox wailing like a wounded animal...
 
              Ali and Loco spin around and look up.
 
              POV OF BARN
 
              Fox comes swinging out, Tarzan-like, from the hayloft on the
              rope attached to the block and tackle.  She's having a hell
              of a good time.

              disappears from view through the square opening in the loft.
              A second later, she reappears, swinging out on the rope again.

              This time the rope swings out from the loft... without Fox
              attached.  There's a dead silence.  The rope dangles.

                                  ALI
                               (to Loco)
                        Go get her out of there.
 
              Loco hunches over, keeping his body low to the ground as he
              high-tails it to the barn and zips inside.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. BARN - DUSK
 
              Loco advances deeper into the barn, his eyes looking
              everywhere.
 
              It's getting darker, minute by minute.
 
                                  LOCO
                               (agitated)
                        Fox... where are ya!?
 
              No response.
 
                                  LOCO
                               (continuing)
                        Stop foolin' around.  You're
                        screwin' up everything.
 
              Still no response.
 
                                  LOCO
                               (continuing)
                        Shit!
 
              He hears the SOUND of banging against the wall of the loft
              above him.  He starts up the ladder.
 
                                  LOCO
                               (continuing)
                        You've had it now, woman!  I'm mad!
 
              LOFT
 
              Loco comes through the opening and steps onto the floorboard.
              The deep shadows hide the corners of the loft and Loco has to
              squint his eyes to see.
 
              Right behind him, he hears the SOUND of the banging again.  He
              whips around...
 
              MUSICAL STINGER...
 
              In front of him, Fox's body, raised off the ground and
              impaled with a pitchfork through her and into the wall.

              Her eyes are open wide with a deathly stare while her feet
              kick against the wall with final spasms of life.  Blood flows
              from the penetrations in her torso.
 
              The horrific sight is even too much for Loco.  He gags and
              grasps his mouth with his hand, choking back a scream.
 
              He turns to run...
 
              Another MUSICAL STINGER!
 
              Loco's face registers shock and horror as he runs smack into
              the teeth of an onrushing pitchfork being thrust at him.
 
              He cringes and gurgles up blood as the prongs are jammed
              through his stomach and out his back.
 
              He staggers, the pitchfork handle sticking straight out of
              his gut.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. BARN - DUSK
 
              Carrying the two jugs of gasoline, one in each hand, Ali is
              just outside the barn doors.  To gain entrance, he kicks on
              the doors and looks around to see if anyone has heard him.
              He waits for one of the two to let him in.
 
              POV OF LAKE
 
              Andy and Debbie frolic by the waterfall, oblivious to the
              murderous goings-on.
 
              ALI
 
              still waiting to be let in.  He kicks on the door again.
 
                                  ALI
                               (loud whisper)
                        Loco... Fox... Open this damn door.
 
              Frustrated by the lack of response from inside, Ali puts one
              can down and pries open the door for himself.  He fumbles his
              way inside.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. BARN - DUSK
 
              Ali closes the door behind him and immediately hears
              FOOTSTEPS CLOMPING around above him in the hayloft.

                                  ALI
                        What the hell are you two doin' up
                        there?
 
              He rages over to the ladder and looks up.  His eyes widen and
              mouth drops open.  Directly above him, Loco, the pitchfork
              still protruding from his stomach, falls through the opening
              in the loft floor, right at Ali.
 
              The two crash to the barn floor, together.  Ali throws Loco's
              body off of him and struggles to his feet.  He backs away,
              fixated on Loco's engorged corpse and cries out for Fox -- a
              deep, moanful bellow.
 
              The CAMERA DOLLIES quickly into a CLOSE SHOT on his face.
              His eyes focus directly in front of him as he SCREAMS right
              into CAMERA.  It's Jason!
 
                                  ALI
                               (trembling)
                        Noooo!
 
              Ali turns and makes a mad dash for the door.  In his panic,
              he trips over one of the gas cans.  Frantically, he crawls on
              his hands and knees to the door.
 
              He reaches to pull himself up by the door and a large monkey
              wrench comes smashing down on the side of his face, bashing
              in his skill.  He slumps to the floor.
 
              In the distance, Andy and Debbie's voices can be heard
              approaching.
 
              From behind Jason, the CAMERA MOVES with him to a side window
              and peers out.
 
              Through the window, we SEE Andy and Debbie, wrapped in the
              blanket, coming up from the lake.  They're wet and dripping.
              Andy pulls Debbie along with him, towards the barn.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        What're you doing?
 
                                  ANDY
                        We haven't looked in the barn,
                        yet.  Let's take a look.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (stopping)
                        Not now.  I'm cold.
 
              Andy moves right up to the grimy window.  Shading his eyes,
              he peeks inside.  He seems to be looking right at Jason (and
              CAMERA), but he apparently doesn't see him.

                                  ANDY
                               (to Debbie)
                        How about a roll in the hay?
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        You can play with yourself, 'cause
                        I'm going in the house.
 
              She turns back towards the house.  Andy lingers for a moment
              then catches up with Debbie.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM / HOUSE - NIGHT
 
              The front door swings open, Debbie and Andy take one step
              in... and duck!
 
              ANDY AND DEBBIE'S POV
 
              A couple of little, red rubberballs spring straight at them
              (and CAMERA), retract quickly and pulsate at them again.
 
              It's SHELLY, a paddleball in each hand.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        Cut it out!
 
                                  SHELLY
                        Can't stop now.
 
              Andy looks into the living room.  Vera, Chili and Chuck are
              engaged in the same child's play.  Each wallops a little
              rubberball in their own inimitable style.
 
                                  VERA
                               (adept)
                        Ninety six... ninety seven...
                        ninety eight... ninety nine... one
                        hundred...
 
              She continues without faltering.
 
                                  CHUCK
                               (fumbling)
                        One hundred... ninety nine...
                        ninety eight...
 
              He misses and tries again.  Chili is hitting the ball as if
              she were serving in a tennis match.  It's a veritable were
              ring circus.
 
                                  ANDY
                        Who brought up this bright idea?

                                  SHELLY
                               (concentrating on the
                                game)
                        We were looking for something to
                        keep our hands busy.  It was
                        either this or an orgy.  Vera
                        chose this.
                               (resigned)
                        What're ya gonna do?
 
              The fireplace is raging with a full-bodied, crackling flame.
              Debbie drags Andy over to the box of paddle rackets in front
              of the fireplace and hands one to him.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        How about you and I whacking a
                        couple of balls around?
 
                                  ANDY
                        If you insist.
 
              They join the others.  Rubberballs are flying from all
              directions (at CAMERA).
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. COVE / LAKE - NIGHT
 
              Derek's VW is parked just off the road overlooking the cove
              not far from the water.
 
              Derek flicks on the car's headlights.  They gleam right into
              CAMERA.
 
              CHRIS
 
              is standing at the water's edge, backlit by the headlight
              beams.
 
                                  DEREK
                               (approaching)
                        Is that better?
 
              Chris nods and sits on the shore, looking out at water.  She
              rubs the chill from her body.  Derek takes off his jean
              jacket and puts it around Chris' shoulders.  He sits down
              beside her.
 
              Derek tosses pebbles across the shimmering water.  Moonlight
              glints like little stars off the ripples.
 
              After an uncomfortable silence, Derek looks over at Chris.
              Silhouetted by the light, Chris' profile is accentuated in
              all its vulnerability and sensuality.

              He puts his arm around her.  She tenses up.  Derek wants to
              kiss her, but doesn't.
 
                                  DEREK
                        You know, I'm not sure I could
                        live anywhere else.  The nights
                        are always so peaceful and quiet.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        It's deceiving.
 
                                  DEREK
                        What do you mean?
 
                                  CHRIS
                        The quiet can fool you.  It fooled
                        me.  You can never be sure of
                        what's out there.
 
              Frustrated, Derek stands up and moves to the edge of the
              water, picking up handfuls of pebbles and throwing them.
 
                                  DEREK
                               (without looking at
                                Chris)
                        Why did you come back here?
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (hesitating)
                        ... To prove something to
                        myself... to prove I'm stronger
                        than I think I am.
 
                                  DEREK
                        And, what about us?
 
                                  CHRIS
                        I'm here with you.  Can't that be
                        enough for now?
 
                                  DEREK
                        I don't know.  I don't see you for
                        months on end, and when I do, you
                        put this wall between us.  How do
                        I break through?
 
                                  CHRIS
                        I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
 
              Derek sits down next to her, again.  There's momentary
              silence.
 
                                  DEREK
                        What happened that night?

                                  CHRIS
                        You promised you'd never ask me.
 
                                  DEREK
                        After you left me that night, I
                        didn't see you or talk to you
                        again for a year.  No one would
                        tell me anything.  All I know is
                        what the police told me.
                               (leaning in to her)
                        We have nowhere to go unless you
                        let me in.
                               (pausing)
                        What happened?
 
              Chris looks into Derek's eyes.

              The SOUND of a rubberball hitting the paddle racket with a
              constant, even rhythm.
 
              IN CLOSE-up, the CAMERA PANS the staring bored faces of

                        you passed the World's Record
                        several whacks ago.
 
                                  ANDY
                               (genuinely excited)
                        I did?!  I broke the world's
                        record.
 
                                  CHUCK
                        Who cares, man?!
 
                                  ANDY
                        I do.
 
              He stops whacking the ball.  The others sigh with relief.

                                  ANDY
                               (continuing)
                        You're all just jealous.
 
                                  SHELLY
                        Actually, I have no idea what the
                        World's Record is.  I was just
                        kidding.
 
              The others laugh.
 
                                  ANDY
                        Think you're funny?  Well, I'll
                        just have to start all over again.
 
              The whole group jumps Andy and wrestles the paddle away from
              him.
 
                                  SHELLY
                        Well, what do we do now?
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (taking Andy by the
                                hand)
                        Come on, Champ, I think you and I
                        can find something to do.
 
              Andy, dutifully and happily, follows Debbie up the winding
              staircase.
 
                                  CHILI
                               (to Chuck)
                        Remember that strange looking
                        plant we saw outside.  Let's go
                        smoke it.
 
              Chuck follows Chili out the back door.
 
              Shelly looks around.  Vera is the only other person in the
              room.  They stare at each other, then look away.
 
                                  SHELLY
                        I guess that leaves you and me.
 
              Awkward silence.  Shelly gets a very determined look on his
              face like his is going to ask Vera something he has never
              asked a woman before.
 
                                  SHELLY
                               (sincere)
                        Vera... you and I have had a
                        chance to really get to know one
                        another today.  I like you... very
                        much.  I was thinking that maybe.

                                  VERA
                               (quickly interrupting)
                        Don't say any more.
 
              Shelly drops his head, dejected.
 
                                  VERA
                               (continuing)
                        I'm going outside for a few
                        minutes.  We'll talk when I get
                        back.
 
              She turns away and goes out the front door.  Shelly moves
              over to the living room window and watches her.
 
              EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
 
              Vera ambles down the porch steps and when she reaches the
              front walk, she surveys the surroundings and breathes deeply.
 
              SHELLY - INT. LIVING ROOM
 
              watches Vera stroll away.  His disappointment is sketched all
              over his face.  He turns away from the window and moves over
              to the fireplace, looking into the flame.
 
              FOREBODING MUSIC...
 
              Jason's dark, hulking frame moves into THE SHOT as he looks
              through the window at Shelly.
 
              Shelly pokes aimlessly at the hot ambers, his back to the
              window, unaware of the lurking Jason.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
 
              Andy and Debbie are locked in each other's arms in front of
              the hammock.
 
                                  ANDY
                        How do we do it?
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (deadpan)
                        First we take off our clothes,
                        then you get on top of me or I get
                        on top of you...
 
                                  ANDY
                        I know how to do it.  I mean, how
                        do we do it in the hammock?

              Without a word, Debbie removes her top garment.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        Think you can figure it out?
 
                                  ANDY
                               (staring at her
                                breasts)
                        I'll think of something.
 
              He wraps his arms around Debbie and fervently kisses her.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. COVE / LAKE - NIGHT
 
              CHRIS AND DEREK
 
              sitting on shore, close together, somber.  The headlight
              beams have dimmed.  The dark, desolate landscape looms around
              them.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        I had never made love to anybody
                        before that night. You made it so
                        special, I hope it would always be
                        like that for us.
 
              The CAMERA begins to dolly slowly -- ever so slowly -- around
              Derek and Chris.
 
              **OPTIONAL:  The following dialogue may be used as a narration
                           over a FLASHBACK SEQUENCE.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        When you dropped me off at the
                        house, it was very late.  My
                        parents were waiting up for me.
                        As soon as I got in the door, they
                        starting yelling and cursing at
                        me.  I was so upset... I told them
                        I slept with you.  My mothers
                        slapped me.  That was the first
                        time she'd ever hit me.  I
                        couldn't believe it.  I ran out of
                        the house and into the woods as
                        fast and as far as I could run.
                        I was crying.  They had destroyed
                        the most beautiful night of my
                        life and I wanted to punish them
                        for that.  I decided to hide out
                        all night.  They'd be so worried 
                        that they'd be sorry for what they
                        did to me.  The woods were cold and
                        damp from the rain.  I found a dry
                        spot under a rotted oak tree and I
                        guess I fell asleep.
                               (takes a deep breath)
                        All I can remember next is being
                        startled out of sleep by the sound
                        of footsteps.  I thought it was my
                        father so I hid behind the tree.
                        But the footsteps just stopped.
                        The woods were dark.  I couldn't
                        see anything.
                               (intensifying)
                        I heard a cracking noise behind
                        me.  I turned around and... and...
                        oh, God... there was this hideous
                        looking man.  So grotesque he was
                        almost inhuman.  He had a knife
                        and he started to slash away at
                        me, again and again.  I was so
                        hysterical and I don't know how I
                        was able to get away.  I ran and
                        ran, but he kept coming.  He was
                        big but so fast.  He caught me and
                        pulled me down to the ground and
                        he... he... ripped my blouse off.
                        I was screaming, but who could
                        hear me?  Then... oh, God... he
                        dragged me by the hair along the
                        ground.  I was kicking and
                        yelling.  He dragged me deeper and
                        deeper into the woods.  Oh,
                        please... please...
 
                                  DEREK
                               (stroking her)
                        It's all right, you're all right.
                        I'm with you.

              EXT. LAKE - NIGHT
 
                                  CHRIS
                        I... I don't know what happened
                        after that.  I must have fainted
                        because the next thing I knew I
                        would talk about it.  And I never
                        have.  Not until now.  I just
                        wanted to forget.  But I can't.
                        I'll never forget that horrible
                        face.  Never.
 
              The car headlights suddenly snap off.
 
                                  CHRIS
                               (alarmed)
                        Who's there?
 
              They look around.  There's no one in sight.
 
                                  DEREK
                        It's the battery, damnit.
 
              The two run up to the car.  Derek jumps in and tries to start
              it.  The engine WHIRS but won't turn over.  Chris looks
              apprehensively at Derek.  He grabs a flashlight from the
              glove compartment, flicks it on and gets out of the car.
 
                                  DEREK
                               (taking Chris' hand)
                        It's no problem.  We'll just walk
                        back.
 
              Hand-in-hand, the two start down the wooded path.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. LAKE - NIGHT
 
              CAMERA SHOOTS over the waterfall towards the dock.  Vera
              strolls down the wooded platform -- the old boards CREAK
              beneath her.
 
              Only the flowing water can be heard as a darkened,
              indistinguishable FIGURE ENTERS FRAME -- directly in front of
              CAMERA -- and lowers himself all the way into the lake by the
              waterfall.
 
              Vera rolls her pant legs up to her knees.  She dangles her
              long legs over the dock.  Her toes break the surface of the
              water, SWOOSHING it back and forth.
 
              LAKE
 
              Air bubbles rise to the top.  Vera does not see the darkened
              figure as he swims beneath the surface of the water.
 
              The night is a symphony of sounds:  crickets SCRATCHING en
              masse, branches and leaves FLUTTERING in the evening breeze,
              water LAPPING at the shore.

              UNDERWATER POV
 
              of Vera.  She leans back, her arms bent behind her, her face
              arched upwards.
 
              VERA'S FEET
 
              kick back and forth SPLASHING the water.  Air bubbles mark
              the trail of the approaching underwater figure.
 
              Vera breathes in.  The sensuous serenity deeply relaxes her.
              She begins to softly sing a song form her childhood in
              Spanish.
 
              UNDERWATER POV
 
              Vera's feet are an arms length away, kicking towards the
              CAMERA LENS.  She finishes her song and lays back...
 
              MUSICAL STINGER!
 
              The figure jumps out of the water and grabs Vera's leg and
              pulls her.  Vera SCREAMS and lurches forward, almost sliding
              off the dock.  She reaches out and clings to the side.
 
              The figure holds her calves and tugs harder.  Vera's grasp is
              slipping.  She tries to kick him off.
 
              Suddenly, the figure releases her limbs and submerges
              underwater.
 
              Vera pulls herself back up onto the dock.
 
              Clad in a black scuba suit and white faceless mask, the
              rotund figure rises out of the water onto the shore.  In one
              hand he holds a small spear-gun.  With the other, he removes
              his mask.  It's Shelly!
 
              Vera glares at him.
 
                                  SHELLY
                        You've just learned a valuable
                        lesson.  A beautiful girl like you
                        should never go out in the dark
                        alone.
 
                                  VERA
                        Damn you, Shelly!
 
              Vera stomps off the dock towards him.  Shelly retracts.
 
                                  VERA
                               (continuing)
                        Why do you do these stupid things?!

                                  SHELLY
                               (looking away)
                        I have to.
 
                                  VERA
                        You don't "have to."
 
                                  SHELLY
                        I just want you to like me.
 
                                  VERA
                        I do like you.  But not when you
                        act like a jerk.
 
                                  SHELLY
                        Being a jerk is better than being
                        nothing.
 
                                  VERA
                        I never said you were "nothing".
 
                                  SHELLY
                        You don't to say it.  I can tell.
 
                                  VERA
                        You're wrong.
 
              Shelly hangs his head and says nothing further.  He just
              walks off towards the house.
 
                                  VERA
                               (sympathetic)
                        Hey... I'll be in, in a little
                        while.  We can talk some more.
 
              EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT
 
              Shelly trudges up the front walk to the porch and plops
              himself down on the porch swing, still clutching the mask and
              spear-gun.
 
              In a contemplative mood, he slowly swings back and forth.
              The taut metal chains that support the swing, vibrate and
              CREAK in a steady rhythm.
 
              Shelly looks down at the lake.
 
              SHELLY'S SWINGING POV
 
              Vera sits back down on the dock, facing away from the house.

              SHELLY
 
              is alerted to what sounds like the cry of a wounded animal
              emanating from the barn.  He looks over and sees a shadow
              cross in front of one of the windows.  The cry continues.
 
              Shelly jumps off the swing and heads for the barn with his
              mask and spear-gun at his side.
 
              EXT. BARN - NIGHT
 
              Shelly comes up to the window and looks in.  It's too dark to
              see anything.
 
                                  SHELLY
                               (rapping on the
                                window)
                        Chuck?  Chili?  What're you guys
                        doing in there?
 
              He hears RUMBLING inside, but no response.  He moves to the
              front doors and pries them open.
 
              INT. BARN - NIGHT
 
              Shelly comes in and fumbles for the light switch.
 
                                  SHELLY
                        You guys doin' somethin' I
                        shouldn't see?
 
              He finds the switch and FLICKS on the light.  The very moment
              the light goes on, an OWL swoops down and aims straight for
              his head (and CAMERA).  Shelly drops the spear-gun and the
              mask to thwart off the bird with his hands.  The owl flies
              out of the partially open barn doors.  Shelly quickly closes
              them.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. LAKE / DOCK - NIGHT
 
              Vera is pacing, back and forth, on the dock.  She stops at
              the far edge and peers into the water.
 
              VERA'S POV
 
              Floating by is a woman's bra (probably, Debbie's).
 
              Vera smirks as she lies prone on the boards and reaches with
              her hand, grabbing the undergarment and rescuing it from the
              lake.

              She leans back into a kneeling position and rings out the
              soggy bra.  Her heels dig into the rear pocket of her jeans,
              pushing a wallet out of the pocket onto the dock.  Vera
              reaches behind her and picks it up.  It's Shelly's wallet --
              the one he gave her at the liquor store.
 
              Leafing through the contents, Vera finds his driver's license
              and a photograph of Shelly and his mother.
 
              She looks around.  Shelly is nowhere in sight.  Assuming he
              has returned to the house, she gets up to look for him -- as
              she rises, her hand knocks against the dock.  The wallet
              slips out her her grasp and bounces into the lake.
 
                                  VERA
                               (watching the wallet
                                sink)
                        That's just great!
 
              After a moment of deliberation, she takes off her shoe and
              plunges into the water, diving after the billfold.
 
              She swims around underneath the surface, searching with her
              hands.  She rises for air periodically.
 
              She submerges deeper than the previous attempts.  Air bubbles
              rising to the surface, establish her whereabouts -- a good
              distance from the shore.
 
              She comes up for air once more, empty-handed.
 
              VERA'S POV
 
              the dock.  A dark figure, wearing Shelly's white mask and
              holding the spear-gun, kneels at the edge of the pier.
 
              From the water, at this distance, Vera easily mistakes the
              figure (Jason) for Shelly.
 
                                  VERA
                               (waving to the
                                figure, shouting)
                        Hey... I dropped your wallet!  I'm
                        sorry!
 
              She starts to breast stroke toward him.
 
              OMINOUS MUSIC throbs on the SOUNDTRACK...
 
              Jason raises the spear-gun to eye level.
 
              Vera swims unknowingly toward her demise.  A few yards from
              the dock, she glides right into Shelly's floating wallet.

              Jason aims the spear-gun.
 
              Vera, grabbing the wallet, she treads water and raises it
              triumphantly over her head for "Shelly" to see.
 
                                  VERA
                               (continuing)
                        I found it!
 
              She looks up to see the spear-gun pointed right at her head
              (and CAMERA).
 
                                  VERA
                               (panicked)
                        What're you doing?  Who are you?!
 
              MUSICAL STINGER!
 
              Jason pulls the trigger, releasing the spear.  With a WHOOSH,
              the arrow penetrates Vera's skull.  A look of unmitigated
              disbelief on Vera's face as she sinks into the water.  Blood
              seeps to the surface.
 
              LONG SHOT
 
              of lake and dock.  Jason, in the distance, his back to
              CAMERA, just stands at the edge of the pier looking down into
              the bloody water.
 
              CAMERA PANS over to the house and CRANES UP to a second floor
              bedroom window, glowing from candlelight, and peers in.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
 
              The room is darkened save for pools of light emanating from
              several candles -- one in each window, the others on the
              opposite side of the room -- lending an atmosphere of warmth
              and intimacy.
 
              CAMERA DOLLIES IN towards the hammock which wildly rocks bath
              and forth accompanied by the sounds of lovemaking.
 
              Debbie and Andy are not visible in full -- only glimpses of
              their naked limbs and torsos can be seen above the curved
              side of the hammock.  Blankets and sheets hang sloppily over
              the edges to the floor.
 
              CAMERA continues to DOLLY IN as the SOUNDS grow more heated
              until Debbie and Andy are FRAMED in a TWO SHOT as they climax.
 
              The thrashing about stops and the hammock slows down to a
              gentle swaying.

                                  DEBBIE
                        That was the best yet.  Was it
                        you... me... or the hammock?
 
                                  ANDY
                        I vote for me.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        I vote for the hammock.
 
              Debbie attempts to get out of the hammock.  It's not a simple
              move -- she nearly falls to the floor taking Andy with it.
 
                                  ANDY
                        I'm seasick.  Get in or get out of
                        the boat.
 
              Debbie gets out.  She heads into the bathroom and flicks on
              the light -- bright and a strain to the eyes.  She turns on
              the shower.
 
                                  ANDY
                               (loud)
                        What're you doin'?
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (poking her head back
                                in)
                        I think it's called "a shower".
                        You might try it sometime.
 
                                  ANDY
                        You're too clean for me.
 
              Debbie responds by closing the door.
 
              INT. STAIRCASE / HALLWAY
 
              FOREBODING MUSIC pierces the SOUNDTRACK...
 
              Displaying a thick-bladed machete, Jason ascends the spiral
              stairs.  Andy can be heard off-screen calling loudly to
              Debbie in the shower.
 
                                  ANDY (O.S.)
                        Hey Deb... can you hear me?
 
                                  DEBBIE (O.S.)
                               (from bathroom)
                        Barely.

                                  ANDY (O.S.)
                               (louder)
                        I'm going downstairs to get a
                        beer. You want one?
 
                                  DEBBIE (O.S.)
                        What?
 
              Jason reaches the landing at the top of the stairs and
              disappears into the shadows.
 
              INT. BATHROOM
 
              Behind the sheer curtain, Debbie's naked silhouette can be
              seen lathering herself in the shower.
 
              SHOWER
 
              Debbie luxuriates in the soap and hot water.
 
              Distorted through the plastic curtain, the door opens.
 
              Debbie remains blissfully unaware as she soaps her face.  She
              hears a BANGING NOISE.  Her eyes are closed due to the soap
              and shower spray.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        Andy?
 
              No response.  Concerned, Debbie turns off the water and wipes
              the soap from her eyes.
 
              Looking up, she sees a shadowy figure poised in front of the
              curtain.  Quickly, she reaches out and rips the curtain
              aside...
 
              Staring her in the face is a pair of men's feet and jean-
              covered legs.  It's Andy, walking on his hands.
 
                                  ANDY
                               (upside-down)
                        Do you want a beer or not?
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (relieved)
                        Sure.
 
              Andy turns himself around and handwalks out of the bathroom.
 
                                  ANDY
                        I'll be back in a minute.
 
              Debbie jumps out of the tub and shuts the door.  She returns
              to the shower and turns the water back on.

                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. BEDROOM / HALLWAY - NIGHT
 
              CLOSE SHOT on Andy upside-down.  CAMERA MOVES with him as he
              hand-steps out of the bedroom.  He WHISTLES an upbeat tune as
              he goes.
 
              An OMINOUS TONE enters the SOUNDTRACK, a haunting counterpoint
              to Andy's WHISTLING.
 
              Jason's hulking frame is braced up against the wall in the
              hallway corridor at the entrance to the bedroom.  Andy is
              unaware of Jason's presence as he hand-walks right past his
              boots towards the staircase.
 
              Off-screen, Debbie calls out to Andy over the SOUND of the
              shower.
 
                                  DEBBIE (O.S.)
                        Andy... Are you still out there?
 
              At the head of the stairs, Andy stops and pivots around 180
              degrees, turning head-on into Jason's boots.  Surprised, he
              looks up.
 
              ANDY'S UPSIDE-DOWN POV
 
              of Jason in Shelly's white mask.  A machete is poised above
              his head.
 
              MUSICAL STINGER!
 
              Before Andy can react, the machete is thrust down between his
              legs, slicing through his upside-down body.  Andy's ghastly
              SCREAM reverberates as he topples backwards down the spiral
              stairs.
 
              Jason retrieves his body.  He drags Andy's halved corpse up
              the stairs and back into the bedroom, closing the door behind
              him.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
 
              With the shower running full blast, the door closed, and
              HUMMING to herself, Debbie remains oblivious to the sounds of
              the murderous activities.  She rinses her hair and turns off
              the faucet.
 
              The CAMERA MOVES slowly IN CLOSE on Debbie as she steps but
              of the tub and dries herself off.

              She hears a CRASHING SOUND that seems to have come from the
              bedroom.  She stands still and listens.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                        Andy?  You can have my beer.  I
                        don't want it.
 
              Humming again, she wraps herself in her robe and swings the
              bathroom door open.
 
              INT. BEDROOM
 
              The room is quiet, untouched.  Andy is nowhere in sight.
              Debbie shrugs it off, moves to the bedroom door, opens it and
              sticks her head out.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (calling downstairs)
                        Andy, don't bring me a beer.  Do
                        you hear me?
 
              She stays at the door for a moment listening for Andy.  Behind
              her, in the bedroom, Jason creeps across room.  Debbie is
              unaware.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (continuing)
                        Andy!  Answer me!  I hate when you
                        do that.
 
              She SLAMS the door shut!  Peeved at Andy, she picks up a book
              (Stephen King's newest novel) from a table and rolls into the
              hammock top of the covers which hang all the way to the floor.
 
              She settles in.  The hammock sways slightly.  She finds her
              place in the book and playing with her damp hair, she starts
              to read.
 
              Quite unexpectedly from above her, a large drop of blood
              falls and splatters all over the white pages of her book.
              Alarmed, she touches the fluid with her finger tips,
              examining it.
 
                                  DEBBIE
                               (incredulous, to
                                herself)
                        Blood...?
 
              She looks up at the ceiling...
 
              DEBBIE'S POV
 
              Wrapped around the rafters is Andy's mangled, bloodied corpse.

              Before Debbie can SCREAM...
 
              MUSICAL STINGER!
 
              From beneath the hammock, hidden by the covers, Jason's hand
              reaches up and around and snaps her head back down, pinning
              her to the pillow.
 
              The carving knife is driven through the back of her neck and
              pops out the front, right at CAMERA.  Blood spurts all over
              Debbie's horrified face.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
 
              A flashlight beam sprays directly into the CAMERA LENS
              bleaching out the FRAME.
 
              Derek and Chris silently walk along the dirt road leading
              back to the house.  Derek holds the flashlight.
 
              Their footsteps add to the cacophony of night sounds.  Chris'
              eyes dart about; she's becoming quite uneasy.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        Could we move a little faster?
 
                                  DEREK
                        Sure, just watch where you're
                        going.
 
              They start to job.  The beam from their flashlight bounces
              all over the road as they run.
 
              Suddenly and unwittingly, Derek strides into a pothole, twist
              his ankle and falls forward.  The flashlight falls from his
              hand.  Derek lands in the arms of a dark figure standing on
              the side of the road.  Derek gasps as the man clutches him.
 
              Chris grabs the flashlight from the ground and shines the
              light into the man's face...
 
              It's Abel, the aged hitchhiker.
 
                                  CHRIS
                        What're you doing out here?
 
              Derek gets back on his feet.  The ankle is tender.
 
                                  DEREK
                        You know him?

                                  CHRIS
                        Sort of.
 
                                  ABEL
                        I'm one of the Flock as are you my
                        Brother and Sister.
 
                                  DEREK
                               (looking askance)
                        Yeah... sure...
                               (to Chris)
                        I think we should be going.
 
              They start to leave, but Abel blocks their path.
 
                                  ABEL
                        I can't let you go.
 
                                  DEREK
                        Look old man, we don't want any
                        trouble.
 
                                  ABEL
                        Then turn around and walk away
                        from trouble.
 
                                  DEREK
                        Come on, Chris...
 
              Derek hobbles past Abel.  Chris follows a moment later.  Abel
              looks after them as they go then up at the sky.
 
                                  ABEL
                        I have done by best.  I can do no
                        more.
 
              Chris looks back at Abel as she and Derek continue down the
              road.

              INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
 
              Chuck stands at the stove, shaking a pot of popcorn over a
              lit burner.  The corn kernels are actively popping as Chuck
              lifts the cover off the pot, revealing the white fluffy
              morsels as they fly up and out (at CAMERA).  Chuck leans in
              to catch them with his mouth.  He captures a few though more
              land on the floor.  He quickly replaces the lid.
 
              Chili comes in from outside with a flashlight in hand.

                                  CHILI
                        I can't find the bong anywhere.
                        Can't you remember where you
                        dropped it?
 
                                  CHUCK
                        I can't even remember what day it
                        is, man.
 
                                  CHILI
                        It's Friday the 13th.
 
              All the lights go out -- complete darkness except for the
              blue fire of the lit burner.  Chili SCREAMS over the sound of
              the popping corn.
 
                                  CHUCK
                               (alarmed)
                        What's the matter?!
 
                                  CHILI
                        Nothin'.  I was just foolin'
                        around.
 
                                  CHUCK
                        Don't do that to me!
 
              Chili flicks on the flashlight and hands it to Chuck.
 
                                  CHILI
                        Here.  Go down the cellar and
                        check the fusebox.
 
                                  CHUCK
                        Will you come with me?
 
                                  CHILI
                        Be a man, man.
 
              Chili takes a kerosene lamp down from the window sill as
              Chuck reluctantly opens the cellar door and starts down the
              stairs.
 
              Chili ignites the lamp's wick, illuminating the kitchen with
              a yellow glow.
 
              She carries the lamp over to the stove and sets it down.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

              INT. CELLAR - NIGHT
 
              Barefoot, Chuck tiptoes down into the dark, musty basement.
              The flashlight beam preceeds his every step as he slowly
              advances.
 
              To calm his anxieties, he talks to himself, outloud.
 
                                  CHUCK
                               (his eyes roving all
                                around)
                        There's nothin' to be scared of,
                        man.  Just go over to the fusebox
                        and check it out.  You can do
                        that.  Yeah, sure.
 
              His bare feet SLOSH in the line of the water puddles on the
              cellar floor as he nears the fusebox.  He raises the
              flashlight at the open box -- the fuses and electrical wiring
              exposed.  The main switch is in the "OFF" position.
 
              Chuck lifts the switch into the "ON" position.  The naked
              basement bulb glimmers.
 
                                  CHUCK
                               (turning to go)
                        Whew... that's better.
 
              MUSICAL STINGER!
 
              Backlit and silhouetted by the bulb is Jason -- a threatening
              sight.
 
              Chuck is startled and scared.  Before he can speak, Jason
              grabs his face with both hands, lifts him off the ground and
              throws him into the open fusebox.
 
              Chuck's feet land in a pool of water as his hands make
              contact with the exposed electrical wires.  Electricity zaps
              through his entire body, electrocuting him.  The lights blink
              on and off.

              INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
 
              Chili is standing at the stove shaking a second pot of
              popcorn kernels.  The blinking lights are an annoyance,
              causing her to squint.  Then, the blinking stops and the
              lights go completely dead.  The lantern remains the only
              light source.

                                  CHILI
                               (calling out)
                        What's goin' on, Chuck?!
 
              There's no answer.  Then abruptly, something heavy bashes
              against the kitchen door.
 
                                  CHILI
                               (continuing)
                        What's goin' on around here?
                        Who's there?
 
              She picks up the lantern and goes to the door.  She hesitates
              then pulls it open.
 
              MUSICAL STINGER!
 
              Shelly's corpse -- his skull split open, his face and chest
              bloodied -- falls into the kitchen at Chili's feet.
 
                                  CHILI
                               (nonchalant)
                        Get up, Shelly.  Stop foolin'
                        around.
 
              She believes this to be another of Shelly's ruses.  Stepping
              over his body, she goes to the basement stairs and calls down
              to Chuck.
 
                                  CHILI
                               (continuing)
                        What're you doin' down there, man?
 
              INT. BASEMENT
 
              Holding the kerosene lamp in front of her, Chili starts down
              the stairs.  FOREBODING MUSIC drones on the SOUNDTRACK,
              accompanying her.
 
                                  CHILI
                        Chuck?
 
              No answer.  She stops at the bottom of the stairs and pans
              the lamp from side to side.
 
              MUSICAL STINGER!
 
              Suddenly, as though suspended from the ceiling, Chuck's head
              and shoulders flop down in front of her, his arms outstretched
              and his face stark white.

                                  CHILI
                               (trembling)
                        Oh, my God...
                               (shouting)
                        Help!!!
 
              She turns and runs up the stairs, the kerosene lamp shaking
              wildly in her hand.
 
              INT. KITCHEN
 
              She bolts out of the basement and stumbles over Shelly's
              body, falling to the floor.  She looks back at Shelly and
              realizes that this is not a joke and that he is, indeed, dead.
 
              She gags and, SCREAMING, grabs the still lit kerosene lamp
              and scrambles to her feet.  She runs into the living room.

              The fireplace is burning bright as Chili dashes to the base

              Of course, no answer.
 
              FIREPLACE
 
              Unseen by Chili, Jason's hand reaches for a sizzling poker
              left in the fire and pulls out the red-hot iron.
 
              Chili swings open the front door.  The CAMERA MOVES in on her
              from behind.  Crying, she SCREAMS out into the darkness.
 
                                  CHILI
                        Vera!  Chris!  Where is

              The CAMERA continues towards her from behind.

                        Oh please, is anybody here?!

              She looks all around.  It's deathly quiet.  She whips around
              and runs back into the --
 
              LIVING ROOM
 
              right at Jason and into the scorching poker.  It burns
              through her blouse and fries the skin around where it
              penetrates.

              Ominous black clouds roll across the heavens.  THUNDER begins

              Deep shadowed woods. A quiet breeze rustles some dry leaves.

              A very mangy wild dog feeds on what was once a rabbit run
              over in the road.  ROARING AROUND THE BEND COMES AN OLD FORD
              PICKUP. The terrified canine runs for its life into the woods.

              TIGHT ON HOCKEY MASK
 
              We stare down on Jason's infamous mask held in a young man's
              (HAWES) hands.

                        talked me into this, Jarvis.
 
              ANGLE ON HAWES
 
              Sitting in the passenger seat examining the mask is ALLEN
              HAWES.  He is a rather unusual-looking guy in his mid-
              twenties, nervously smoking a cigar.

                        Hell, I must be crazy.  If the old
                        institution ever found out about
                        this...boy, they'd throw our butts
                        back in an' strait-jacket 'em
                        permanent.
 
                                  TOMMY (o.s.)
                        You didn't have to come, Hawes...
 
              PRESS IN - ON DRIVER
 
              TOMMY JARVIS is a good-looking young man in his late teens.
              He drives like a bat out of hell, wearing a very intense
              expression of determination.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        This is between me and Jason.

              TWO SHOT ON THEM
 
                                  HAWES
                               (becoming more nervous)
                        Yeah, I know.  But I still don't
                        get the therapy here. Jason's
                        dead, right?  How will seeing his
                        corpse stop your hallucinations?
 
                                  TOMMY
                        Seeing it won't. But destroying
                        him once and for all will. Jason
                        belongs in hell.
 
              TIGHT ON TOMMY
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (coldly)
                        I'm gonna see he gets there.
 
              HAWES
 
              stares wide-eyed at Tommy.  He then turns to look out the
              back window.
 
              EXT. PICKUP
 
              TIGHT ON HAWES' FACE IN REAR WINDOW - TILT DOWN
 
              A huge can of gasoline, a crowbar and two shovels are seen in
              the back of the truck.  THUNDER BEGINS TO RUMBLE LOUDER.
 
              EXT. FOREST ROAD - NIGHT
 
              Dust kicks up as the old pickup races down the road.
              LIGHTNING FLASHES, illuminating the dark woods.  THUNDER
              CRASHES HELLISHLY.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
 
              TRACKING along a row of tombstones, we follow Tommy and his
              flashlight as he searches.  Hawes follows, carrying the gas
              can, tools and mask. THUNDER continues as a fierce, whistling
              WIND attacks.
 
              Tommy's eyes squint to read each tombstone, looking for the
              one.  LIGHTNING FLASHES.

              WIDER - ON TOMMY
 
              Getting frustrated, but far from giving up, Tommy moves to
              the new row of markers.  Suddenly he freezes and we PRESS IN
              on him.
 
              ANGLE ON JASON'S GRAVE
 
              LIGHTNING illuminates the tombstone that reads "Jason
              Voorhees - At Rest".
 
              TIGHT ON TOMMY
 
              As he stares, a deep terror chills his bones.  Something else
              then catches his eye.
 
              ANGLE ON ANOTHER GRAVE
 
              Close to Jason's marker we see another.  It reads "Pamela
              Voorhees - Beloved Mother."
 
              FULL SHOT ON TOMMY AND HAWES
 
              Returning his attention to Jason's grave, Tommy points "this
              is the one" to Hawes, who gulps and nods.  Putting down the
              other items, the boys take hold of the shovels.  Tommy raises
              his up first.
 
              THE SHOVEL
 
              plunges into the ground.  A LIGHTNING BLAST punctuates it as
              it removes a large chunk of grass and dirt.
 
              CLOSE ON OUR GRAVEDIGGERS
 
              They begin to exhume the legendary killer's body. Tommy works
              feverishly.  Hawes works nervously.
 
              Again and again their shovels strike, digging into the earth.
 
                                                       SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
 
              THE SHOVEL (LATER)
 
              is scraping the dirt of of a rotted coffin lid.
 
              ANGLE UP - ON TOMMY
 
              The sweating boy tosses the shovel out of the shallow grave.
              Hawes silently hands him the crowbar from above.

              TIGHT ON COFFIN
 
              The crowbar is driven into the side.  Tommy's hands take a
              firm grip and yank.  A HORRIFIC CREAK resounds as the lid
              cracks open.
 
              LOW ANGLE - ON TOMMY
 
              He hands the crowbar back to Hawes.  They exchange a look and
              a deep breath.  Tommy then goes for it.  His hands extend
              slowly toward the coffin.  More THUNDER GROWLS.
 
              TOMMY'S FINGERS
 
              slip into the narrow space beneath the coffin lid.
 
              PRESS IN TIGHT ON HAWES' FACE
 
              He winces and bites his lip.
 
              PRESS IN TIGHT ON TOMMY'S FACE
 
              With all the courage he can muster, Tommy strains to do the
              deed.  He yanks the casket open!
 
              ANGLE ON JASON IN COFFIN
 
              With a BRILLIANT FLASH OF LIGHTNING, the lid swings open to
              reveal the huge decomposing body of JASON.  His HEAD IS
              COMPLETELY COVERED BY AN ARMY OF DISGUSTING MAGGOTS.
 
              HAWES GASPS
 
              He fights with his stomach to keep his dinner down..
 
              TOMMY CLIMBS OUT OF GRAVE
 
              He turns and stares down at his nemesis. A slow hatred begins
              to build.  We PRESS IN on Tommy, HEARING his horrid memories:
              His sister screams, NO, TOMMY, NO while 10-year-old Tommy
              kills Jason, repeating, "DIE, DIE!"
 
              TIGHT ON TOMMY
 
              As he listens, his eyes well up with a violent rage.
 
              WIDER
 
              Tommy looks around vengefully.  Seeing an old fence a few
              yards away, he heads for it.  Hawes is confused by his
              actions.
 
                                  HAWES
                        Hey, where are you going?

              TRACK WITH TOMMY
 
              Without a word, he storms over to the rusty fence. He grabs
              one of the spearlike posts and pulls it out.
 
              LOW ANGLE - DOLLY BACK
 
              With fire in his eyes, Tommy stalks Jason with the weapon.
              THUNDER ROARS ABOVE.
 
              HAWES
 
              rushes up to Tommy, greatly alarmed.
 
                                  HAWES
                        What's that for? Tommy, what are
                        you doin', boy?!
 
              The boy storms right past him.
 
              REACHING THE GRAVE
 
              Tommy glares down hatefully at this monster who has destroyed
              his loved ones and his life. Raising the spear, he explodes
              and jumps down.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        You bastard!
 
              LOW ANGLE - ON TOMMY
 
              As he lands in the grave, Tommy plunges the spear down with
              a mighty force. THUNDER AND LIGHTNING BLAST HELLISHLY.
 
              THE SPEAR
 
              penetrates deep into Jason's chest.
 
              ANGLE ON HAWES, DUMBFOUNDED
 
                                  HAWES
                        Oh, shit.
 
              TOMMY
 
              withdraws it, then angrily rams it down again and again.
 
              CLOSE ON JASON'S FACE
 
              The force of the blows causes many of the numerous maggots to
              start dropping off his face. Grossly decayed flesh is
              illuminated the LIGHTNING.

              CLOSE ON TOMMY'S FACE
 
              Exhausted, his rage finally vented, he drives the spear into
              Jason for the last time.
 
              ANGLE DOWN - ON TOMMY AND JASON
 
              Over the boy's shoulder we see the long spear extending out
              of Jason's cold heart.
 
              WIDER
 
              Recovering from his tantrum, Tommy climbs out of the grave.
              Hawes stares open-mouthed at his friend.
 
                                  HAWES
                        Boy, he must've really messed you
                        over.
 
              TOMMY
 
              reaches down, picks up Jason's hockey mask, and stares at it.
 
              INSERT - HOCKEY MASK
 
              It seems to stare back evilly at him.
 
                                  TOMMY (O.S.)
                        Yeah.  Fuck you, Jason.
 
              RESUME TOMMY
 
              Tommy, knowing the nightmare is finally over, tosses the mask
              into the grave.  He then bends down and starts to uncap the
              gas can.
 
              WIDER ON SCENE
 
              Without warning, the sky EXPLODES with a mass of LIGHTNING.
              One of the BOLTS OF ELECTRICITY is drawn to the spear as to
              a lightning rod.  SPARKS fly as the spear is struck and
              electrified.  Tommy and Hawes dive for cover.
 
              TIGHT ON JASON'S FACE
 
              JASON'S DECOMPOSED EYELIDS FLASH OPEN!
 
              ANGLE ON TOMMY AND HAWES
 
              Uncovering their heads, they look skyward in fear.  Quickly,
              Tommy gets to his feet and goes for the troublesome spear.

              ANOTHER ANGLE
 
              The unintended lightning rod is still smoking a little from
              the blast.  He touches it.  It's hot.  He pulls out a pair of
              gloves from his jacket.  Putting them on, he then attempts to
              remove the spear.  He can't get proper leverage.  So Tommy
              jumps down into Jason's grave.
 
              LOW ANGLE - ON TOMMY
 
              He struggles to pull the spear out.  It's apparently driven
              into the bottom of the coffin as well.  Hawes leans down into
              the grave.
 
                                  HAWES
                        Let's just get the hell out of
                        here.  My heart can't take any
                        more of this.
 
              CLOSE ON JASON'S FACE
 
              Jason's wicked eyes glare at Tommy.
 
              RESUME TOMMY
 
              The boy, of course, does not see what's about to occur.  He
              finally yanks the spear out, and throws it up onto the grass.
              Slowly he removes his gloves and tosses them to Hawes.  He
              starts to climb out.  JASON SPRINGS UP FROM BEHIND AND GRABS
              HIM.
 
              CLOSE ON HAWES SCREAMING
 
              He goes crazy with hysteria.  He starts to run.
 
              ANGLE DOWN - ON GRAVE
 
              Tommy fights for his life as Jason tries to pull him down
              into the grave.  He manages to kick Jason back down long
              enough to climb out.
 
              TOMMY
 
              scrambles for the gas can as the STORM CLOUDS DETONATE ABOVE.
              He gets it open, turns around, and starts throwing it on the
              rising corpse of Jason.
 
              ANGLE ON JASON
 
              The gas splashes all over him as he keeps coming!

              REVERSE ON TOMMY
 
              He backs up as Jason stalks him.  Knowing there's enough gas
              now on his predator, he drops the can.
 
              TIGHTER - ON JASON
 
              He's coming closer.
 
              TIGHTER - ON TOMMY
 
              Panicking, he searches his pockets for the matches.  He finds
              them.  As he pulls them out, the STORM CLOUDS ERUPT WITH AN
              INCREDIBLE DOWNPOUR.
 
              JASON
 
              stops as the rain drenches him.  Maggots start to wash off
              him as he stares at his helpless victim.
 
              RESUME TOMMY
 
              He tries desperately to light a match in this pounding rain.
 
              TOMMY'S HANDS
 
              struggling with the soaked matchbook.
 
              JASON
 
              starts to close in.  Suddenly HAWES EMERGES FROM BEHIND,
              HOLDING UP A SHOVEL.  He HOLLERS as he swings it.
 
              ANGLE ON HAWES
 
              He WHACKS the back of Jason's head as hard as he can.  It
              doesn't even faze his undead superkiller.
 
              JASON WHIPS AROUND ON HAWES
 
              His arm lunges forcefully at Hawes' chest.
 
              ANGLE HAWES' BACK
 
              JASON'S HAND, CLUTCHING HAWES' HEART, BURST OUT HAWES' BACK.
 
              ANGLE ON GRAVE
 
              Hawes' body falls back into Jason's grave.
 
              TIGHT ON COFFIN
 
              As Hawes lands in the coffin, the lid shuts over him.

              ANGLE ON TOMMY
 
              Horrified and weaponless, he runs like hell.
 
              LOW ANGLE - ON JASON
 
              Seeing his victim escaping, Jason whips around and looks for
              a weapon.  He goes for the nefarious spear.  Something in the
              grave then catches his attention.
 
              EXT. FOREST ROAD - NIGHT
 
              Tommy races out of the cemetery to his pickup.  He jumps into
              the truck and takes off in the rain.
 
              EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
 
              With his back to us, Jason dons his beloved hockey mask and
              picks up the spear.  We PRESS IN TIGHT ON HIM as he turns
              around to face us.  FREEZE FRAME.  Meaner, stronger, and more
              unstoppable than ever before...

              FADE IN:
 
              EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT
 
              Tommy's old pickup SCREECHES UP before us.  He leaps from the
              truck and races for the office door.  The sign by it reads
              "Forest Green County Sheriff's Dept."
 
              INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT
 
              Tommy BURSTS into the room.
 
              ANGLE ON SHERIFF BEHIND DESK
 
              SHERIFF MICHAEL GARRIS is a hard-ass Vietnam vet who, at
              forty-three, has "seen enough trouble and don't want no
              more."  That's why he took this job a few years back.  Having
              just nodded off, Tommy's entrance startles him.  He leaps to
              his feet, gun drawn with lightning speed.
 
              REVERSE ON TOMMY
 
              Shocked by the sheriff's sudden aggression, Tommy instantly
              throws up his hands.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        Don't shoot.  Please.

              ANGLE ON SHERIFF
 
              He relaxes, seeing it's just a teenager.  But he's still
              pissed off as he holsters his gun.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        You in show business, kid?  You
                        sure know how to make an entrance.
 
              MOVING SHOT
 
              The hyper boy rushes toward the sheriff.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        You gotta do something!  Jason's
                        alive!  He killed my friend, now
                        he's coming for me!!
 
              EXT. FOREST ROAD - NIGHT
 
              Jason is coming.  Gripping the spear before him, he heads
              toward us.

                        Now you better cool out a minute,
                        boy.  You already almost got your
                        head blown to pieces.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (demanding)
                        Will you listen, dammit!
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (stands up)
                        Don't piss me off, junior.  Or I
                        will repaint this office with your
                        brains.
 
              Tommy tries to control his emotions and sound rational.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        Jason is alive.  We dug up his
                        body.  I was gonna cremate it
                        and...
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (smirks and interrupts)
                        Hold it.  Whoa... What's your
                        name, son?

                                  TOMMY
                               (quickly)
                        Tommy Jarvis.  We gotta do
                        something.  He's even more
                        powerful now that...
 
              The sheriff circles the desk and approaches Tommy.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Aren't you the kid whose mother
                        and friends were....
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (nods)
                        Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (cutting him off again)
                        And you've been at some
                        psychiatric clinic ever since,
                        haven't you?
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (catching his drift)
                        Yes, but they released me
                        because...
 
              The door behind him BURSTS OPEN.
 
                                  DEPUTY
                        Rains stopped.  Ya owe me that
                        five-spot, partner.
 
              ANGLE ON DOORWAY
 
              DEPUTY RICK COLONE hurries in with an armload of fast food.
              Dark, mid-thirties, and a little on the short side.  He is
              surprised to see someone here this late.
 
                                  DEPUTY
                        Sorry.  I didn't...
 
              BACK TO SCENE
 
              Sheriff Garris waves his deputy in.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (sarcastic)
                        No problem, Rick.  Come over and
                        meet a former resident here, Tommy
                        Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank
                        going about...

                                  TOMMY
                               (explodes)
                        There's no time for this
                        bullshit...
 
              MOVING SHOT - ON TOMMY
 
              He bolts across the office and grabs one of the rifles from
              the rack.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        Jason's got to be stopped.
 
              ANGLE ON GROUP
 
              Both lawmen drive for the crazy kid. Their food flies as they
              struggle to get the rifle away from the strong youth.
 
              Finally the deputy pins Tommy's arms from behind.  The
              sheriff yanks the rifle away.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (pointing at Tommy)
                        Now that's what know in the books
                        as screwin' the pooch.
                               (to deputy)
                        Iron this punk.
 
              Tommy fights to get away from the deputy, who throws him into
              the cell.  The iron bars are slammed shut.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (struggling)
                        No... Ya gotta listen.  Jason's
                        coming back here.  He's after me.
                        I tried to destroy him but I
                        fucked up....
 
              TIGHT ON SHERIFF
 
              He leans in toward Tommy's cell.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        You got that right.  Now you
                        listen up.  I'm sorry for what
                        happened to you and your folks
                        years ago.  But no one in Forest
                        Green wants to be reminded of what
                        that maniac did here.  That's why
                        they changed the name to Forest
                        Green.  People want to forget this
                        was once Crystal Lake.  And they
                        don't need some kid stirring up
                        Jason shit again.

              RESUME ON TOMMY
 
              He paces the cell in wild frustration.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        Why didn't you cremate him?!
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (impatiently)
                        They were gonna!  But some asshole
                        sent a lot of money to give Jason
                        and his mother a decent burial.
                        Now look, you just lie down and
                        get some rest.  In the morning
                        I'll call that clinic and see if
                        they...
 
              Tommy grabs the bars and pleads with him.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        If you'd just go to the cemetery,
                        you'll see I'm not lying.
 
              CLOSER ON SHERIFF AND TOMMY
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Either you go to sleep or I'll
                        come in there and put you out.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (defiantly)
                        You're gonna be sorry you didn't
                        listen to me.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (more defiantly)
                        You're gonna be sorry if you don't
                        shut the fuck up.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. FOREST BACK ROAD - NIGHT
 
              A funky VW Bug bounces along a narrow muddy road.  LAUGHTER
              is HEARD from within.
 
              INT. CAR - NIGHT
 
              A likable couple in their mid-twenties are obviously lost.
              LIZBETH drives and giggles, slap-happy from the long trip and
              late hour.  Her boyfriend, DARREN, struggles to read the map
              in the dim car light.  A huge pothole causes him to bang his
              head on the roof.

                                  DARREN
                        Will you slow down?  It's hard
                        enough to read this thing.
 
                                  LIZBETH
                               (trying not to laugh)
                        Well, who told me to take this cow
                        path?
 
                                  DARREN
                        You admit the sign did say "Camp
                        Forest Green," with an arrow
                        pointing this way.
 
                                  LIZBETH
                        I admit nothing without talking to
                        my lawyer.
 
              DARREN
 
              throws down the map with a growl.
 
                                  DARREN
                        So much for the head counselors
                        ever finding the camp on their
                        own.  I say we stop the car, get
                        out, and start screaming for help.
 
              The car comes to a grinding halt.
 
                                  DARREN
                               (sighs)
                        I was just kidding, Lizbeth.
 
              He looks at his girlfriend, who is staring fearfully out the
              windshield.  Darren turns to look.
 
              DARREN'S P.O.V. - OUT WINDSHIELD
 
              Standing in the middle of the road, illuminated by the
              headlights... JASON.  He holds the deadly spear before him.
 
              RESUME COUPLE
 
              Needless to say, Lizbeth is becoming more afraid.
 
                                  LIZBETH
                        Darren, we better turn around.
 
                                  DARREN
                        Why?

                                  LIZBETH
                        Why?  Because I've seen enough
                        horror movies to know masked
                        weirdos are never friendly.
 
              She starts to back up.  Darren looks behind him, then grabs
              the wheel.
 
                                  DARREN
                        Wait!
 
              THE CAR TIRE
 
              almost rolls off the narrow road into a water-filled gully.
 
              ANGLE ON DARREN
 
              He stares intensely at Lizbeth.
 
                                  DARREN
                        There's no way we can do this...
                               (he looks at Jason)
                        ...If the car drops into that
                        gully, we'll never get it out.
 
              JASON
 
              just stands his ground.  He ain't backin' down.
 
              LIZBETH
 
              keeps her eye on the evil-looking stranger.
 
                                  LIZBETH
                        Do you have any alternate
                        suggestions?
 
              ANGLE ON DARREN AND LIZBETH
 
              He bites his lip nervously.
 
                                  DARREN
                        Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
 
                                  LIZBETH
                               (taken aback)
                        We're gonna scare him?!
 
              Darren attempts to pump up a macho attitude.
 
                                  DARREN
                        That's right.  Just drive toward
                        him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to
                        die.

                                  LIZBETH
                               (staring at Darren)
                        That's a freakin' fact.  Least of
                        all us.
 
                                  DARREN
                        Just drive.  He'll get out of our
                        way.
 
              ANGLE ON LIZBETH
 
              She shakes her head, not believing she's actually going to do
              this.
 
              INSERT - ACCELERATOR
 
              Her foot stomps it down.
 
              THROUGH WINDSHIELD
 
              We race toward Jason, who doesn't budge.
 
              INSERT - BRAKE
 
              Her foot slams on the brakes.
 
              LOW ANGLE - ON HEADLIGHT
 
              The car skids to a stop, inches from the stock-still killer.
 
              LIZBETH
 
              turns to her now-less-than-confident boyfriend.
 
                                  LIZBETH
                               (sarcastically)
                        Yeah, that really scared the shit
                        out of him.
 
              ANGLE ON DARREN
 
              He gets pissed.  He leans over and BLASTS the HORN.
 
              LOW ANGLE - ON JASON
 
              Jason gets pissed too.  He swings the spear and SMASHES OUT
              a headlight.
 
              BACK TO COUPLE
 
                                  DARREN
                               (shocked)
                        Oh, jeez.

                                  LIZBETH
                               (starting to shift)
                        That's it.  We're driving this
                        baby back to town... in reverse.
 
              Darren, now angered, grabs her hand as she starts to shift.
 
                                  DARREN
                        The hell we are.
 
              ANGLE ON GLOVE COMPARTMENT
 
              Darren opens it and pulls out a .22 revolver.
 
              LIZBETH
 
              stares at the gun, then at Darren, in shock.
 
                                  LIZBETH
                        Where'd you get that?
 
              Darren gets out of the car.  He's scared shitless, but tries
              not to show it.
 
                                  DARREN
                        Don't worry about it.  Just stay
                        cool.
 
                                  LIZBETH
                               (trying to maintain)
                        Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry.
                        Now stop it.
 
              JASON
 
              watches Darren's every move.
 
              DOLLY BACK ON DARREN TO JASON
 
              With great apprehension he heads toward Jason, holding the
              gun out with both hands.  He clears his nervous throat.
 
                                  DARREN
                        All right, scumbag.  Get out of
                        the road.
 
              From over Jason's shoulder we see Darren cock the trigger and
              aim.
 
                                  DARREN
                        Now!
 
              Instantly Jason rams the spear into the other headlight!  He
              is now a very dark figure in front of the car.

              LIZBETH
 
              screams, and shouts at her boyfriend.
 
                                  LIZBETH
                        Darren, get in here right now!
                        He'll kill you!
 
              ANGLE ON DARREN
 
              He gets a bit cocky, knowing he's the one with the gun.  He
              glances back at his girl.
 
                                  DARREN
                               (loudly)
                        Not if I get him first.
 
              JASON
 
              suddenly CHARGES him!
 
              ANGLE ON DARREN AND JASON
 
              Darren fires.  But the bullet either misses or it just
              doesn't affect Jason.  He thrusts the spear forward.
 
              THE SPEAR
 
              drives right through Darren's stomach and out his back!
 
              PRESS IN ON LIZBETH
 
              She goes hysterical.
 
              LOW ANGLE - ON JASON
 
              Effortlessly, he lifts up the impaled boy and tosses his limp
              body aside.  Jason then turns his murderous gaze on Lizbeth.
 
              THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
 
              Lizbeth gasps.  Quickly, she tries to drive away.  Seeing
              something coming, she dives across the other seat.  JASON'S
              SPEAR SMASHES THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD AND IMPALES ITSELF INTO
              THE DRIVER'S SEAT.
 
              ANGLE ON LIZBETH
 
              The terrified girl crawls out of the open passenger door.
              She falls into the muddy and water-filled gully alongside the
              road.

              MOVING SHOT - ON JASON
 
              He withdraws his weapon from the car and heads for his victim.
 
              LIZBETH
 
              struggles to stand.  She slips, badly twisting or breaking
              her ankle.  Looking back quickly, she is horrified.
 
              HER P.O.V. - ON JASON
 
              with spear poised, he's coming!
 
              TIGHT ON LIZBETH
 
              Knowing it's hopeless to run, she tries a last-ditch effort
              to barter for her life.  Lying in the muddy water, Lizbeth
              digs into her jacket.  She pulls out her wallet and removes
              her money and credit cards.
 
                                  LIZBETH
                               (crying)
                        Don't kill me, please.  You can
                        have these.
 
              She looks up and offers her valuables.
 
              LIZBETH'S P.O.V.
 
              Jason is gone.
 
              BACK TO LIZBETH
 
              She is amazed.  Where did he go?  What's the difference --
              she's safe.  WRONG.  As she looks behind her, JASON'S FEET
              SLAM DOWN IN THE WATER NEXT TO HER HEAD.  She opens her mouth
              to scream.
 
              LOW ANGLE - UP ON JASON
 
              He raises the spear and RAMS IT DOWN TOWARD HER FACE!  A
              spine-chilling CRUNCH is HEARD.
 
              WIDER
 
              Jason stands over his victim... Her body floats on the filthy
              water, but her head is drive down underneath.  BLOOD begins
              to bubble up around the extended spear.
 
              CLOSE ON HER HAND
 
              A lifeless hand releases the money and credit cards it was
              clutching.

              We follow the floating American Express card along the now-
              bloody stream... Remember, don't leave home without it.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY
 
              Tommy is asleep on the cot in his cell.  Suddenly the LOUD
              SOUNDS of the DOOR OPENING and YOUNG VOICES startle him awake.
 
              MOVING SHOT - ON GROUP
 
              Entering from the bright sunshine are the sheriff and four
              kids in their late teens.  Teasing, holding on to the arm of
              her sheriff father, is MEGAN.  She is a cute and feisty 18-
              year-old.  Her three friends, PAULA, a warm and personable
              girl with a short new-wave haircut; SISSY is black, sexy and
              very boy-crazy; and CORT, with his long hair and heavy metal
              T-shirt, is always ready to rock.
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (to sheriff)
                        Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick
                        drive down Cunningham Road and
                        look for them.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Megan, my deputies have more
                        important things to do than look
                        for camp counselors with car
                        trouble.
 
                                  CORT
                        Sheriff, couldn't you like put our
                        an all-points bulletin for them?
                        That would be really wicked decent.
 
              The sheriff shoots him a look.
 
                                  PAULA
                        It's just that Darren and Lizbeth
                        are in charge of organizing and
                        setting up the new campgrounds.
 
                                  SISSY
                        All the little kids arrive today.
                        We're not ready to deal with that
                        alone.
 
              ANGLE ON SHERIFF
 
              He sits down behind his desk and picks up the phone.

                                  SHERIFF
                        I sympathize with you kids.  The
                        best I can do is call the station
                        in Carpenter and have them keep a
                        lookout for them.
 
                                  TOMMY (O.S.)
                        I got a bad feeling of what
                        might've happened to them.
 
              Everyone turns to look.
 
              TOMMY
 
              is gripping the cell's bars.  His eyes connect with Megan.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        You've got to convince the sheriff
                        to look for your friends.
                        Hopefully, they're fine.  But
                        there's a very good chance that
                        Jason...
 
              THE SHERIFF
 
              jumps up angrily.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Shut up.
 
              Megan, attracted to the good-looking prisoner, walks toward
              his cell.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        Jason who?
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (ordering her)
                        Megan, get away from him.  He's
                        dangerous.
 
              ANGLE ON MEGAN AND TOMMY
 
              She stops a few feet from the cell.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (sincerely)
                        I'm not dangerous, believe me.
                        Jason is out there.  He's looking
                        for me.  But there's every
                        possibility he'll return to the
                        camp where it all started.

              WIDER ON SCENE
 
              The sheriff stomps over toward Tommy.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (clenching his teeth)
                        I told you to shut...
 
                                  SISSY
                               (nervously)
                        You mean the Jason of Camp Blood?
 
                                  TOMMY
                        Yes!
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        No!...
                               (to kids)
                        ... You kids better leave.  This
                        boy here is not well and I need to
                        talk to him in private.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        But, Dad, we...
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (very firmly)
                        Megan, take your friends back to
                        the camp.  I'll let you know if I
                        hear anything about your
                        counselors.
 
              ANGLE ON MEGAN
 
              She wants to argue, but the look in her father's eye tells
              her she'd better cool it.  She takes one more look at Tommy
              as she approaches her father.
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (wisecracking)
                        Don't beat him up too bad, he's
                        kinda cute.
 
              This really steams the sheriff.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Megan, leave!
 
              BACK TO KIDS
 
              They stumble out awkwardly as Megan struts away with a cool
              Lauren Bacall swagger.

              ANGLE ON TOMMY AND THE SHERIFF
 
              On the door is closed, the steely-eyed sheriff leans in close
              to Tommy's face.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        I was going to call the clinic and
                        have them collect your ass.  But
                        I don't want you around here any
                        longer poisoning my daughter, or
                        anyone else, with your warped mind.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (extremely concerned)
                        But they have to be warned,
                        Sheriff.  Jason will return to the
                        area that's familiar.  No matter
                        what you call it, it's still Camp
                        Crystal Lake to him.
 
              SHERIFF GARRIS
 
              walks away, not listening to Tommy.  He straps on his holster
              and puts on his coat.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (deadly serious)
                        We're gonna escort you and that
                        shit-pile pickup of yours to the
                        edge of my jurisdiction....
                               (he picks up his rifle)
                        ....Then we'll say goodbye and
                        we'll never see your deranged butt
                        around here again...
                               (he cocks rifle)
                        ...Right?
 
              TOMMY
 
              pushes off the bars in frustration and paces the cell like a
              caged animal.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. FOREST - DAY
 
              A large clump of thick bushes.  Someone's moving behind them.
              We TRACK along, following the rustles.  It stops. We HOLD and
              WAIT.  SUDDENLY THE BUSHES PART ABRUPTLY.  A bespectacled
              little man in Army fatigues and camouflage makeup pokes his
              head out at us.  ROY, wearing protective goggles, looks right-
              left, then hides back in the brush.

              ANOTHER AREA OF THE FOREST
 
              We follow TWO OTHER BUSINESSMEN decked out in green jungle
              fatigues, looking like out-of-shape Rambos.  STAN and LARRY
              are both carrying handguns, watching for any movement around
              them.  They, too, wear goggles.
 
                                  STAN
                               (quietly)
                        Once we nail Roy, that's it.
                        Victory is ours.
 
                                  LARRY
                        This is taking forever.  I'm
                        starving.
 
                                  STAN
                        That's your problem, Larry.
                        That's why your sales are always
                        below quota.  Your instinct to eat
                        is stronger than your instinct to
                        win.

                        Yeah, that's fat too.
 
              ANGLE OVER JASON'S SHOULDER
 
              He watches motionlessly as the two arguing men pass.  They,
              of course, don't see him.
 
              BACK TO GUYS
 
                                  LARRY
                               (outraged)
                        You become a whole other person
                        when you're out here, Stan.  And
                        I don't like it.

                        This is a man's game.  Requiring
                        a man's cunning and intelligence...
 
              SUDDENLY, A FIGURE EXPLODES OUT OF THE BRUSH.
 
              ANGLE ON STAN AND LARRY
 
              They react in terror.

              LOW ANGLE
 
              A goggle-wearing woman, also in Army fatigues, has her
              revolver pointed at them.  KATIE fires at them.
 
              BOTH GUYS
 
              are splattered by red-paint pellets.  Boy, are they pissed.
 
              KATIE
 
              grins triumphantly.
 
                                  KATIE
                        ....with a woman's touch.

                                  STAN
                        Now wait a second!  I thought Burt
                        shot you.
 
                                  KATIE
                               (turns all around)
                        See any paint?...
                               (cocky)
                        ...Sorry, guys, I did in Mr.
                        Commando.  Survival is the name of
                        the game, and that flag is mine.
 
              As they walk away, Larry looks at his paint-smeared chest.
 
                                  LARRY
                               (to Stan)
                        Never should've let her play.
 
                                  STAN
                        It's a damn company executive
                        game, and she's a damn company
                        exec.

                        Now, now, boys.  Don't be
                        spoilsports.
 
              JASON
 
              silently watches.  He then heads for them!

              EXT. CAMP FOREST GREEN - DAY
 
              The freshly painted and beautifully renovated cabin retreat
              gleams in the bright sunlight.  Even the lake itself shimmers
              tranquilly, free of any memories of its horrid past.
 
              Megan, Cort, Paula, and Sissy carry food supplies from their
              car to the cabin.

                        No...about Darren and Lizbeth.
                        They should have at least called.
                        Don't you think, Megan?...Megan.
 
              Megan's mind is definitely on something--or someone--else.
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (breaking out of it)
                        Huh?  Yeah, what?

                               (giggles)
                        This girl's back in the cell with
                        her prisoner of love.
 
              Megan hits her playfully.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        What's it to ya?

                        Don't be playin' with no crazy

                                  SISSY
                        I've been around long enough...to
                        see plenty on TV.
 
              Everyone laughs or groans at Sissy.
 
                                  PAULA
                        I don't know, Megan.  He seemed
                        pretty weird with all that Jason
                        stuff.

                                  CORT
                        Yeah, he was really into it.
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (playing with them)
                        Maybe he was telling the truth.
 
              Everyone stops and stares at her in disbelief.
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (keeping the ruse going)
                        Just because our parents keep
                        telling us that Jason was only a
                        legend, doesn't mean it wasn't
                        true.  What if Jason did come back
                        here...
                               (dramatically)
                        ...And you know what today's date

              ANGLE ON HER THREE FRIENDS
 
              Each of their faces registers a different expression,
              wondering if Megan is serious or not.
 
              MEGAN
 
              looks past them at something, then smiles.
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (slyly)
                        I can think of only one thing even
                        more terrifying.

                        What?
 
              She points behind them.  They turn to look.
 
              A BIG YELLOW BUS
 
              pulls up into the camp.  The doors fly open.  A group of
              screaming youngsters pile out.
 
              THE COUNSELOR
 
              stare in dread.  How are they gonna handle this?
 
                                  SISSY
                        I think I'd rather deal with ol'
                        Jason.

              A MACHETE IS SEEN.  We follow the deadly weapon as it's
              carried through the woods.  Reaching some heavy brush, it
              hacks away at it.
 
              WIDER ANGLE REVEALS
 
              BURT, a real Rambo/Commando clone in paint-splattered
              fatigues, whacks angrily at the brushes.  Of all the would-be
              hunters, he looks like he takes the game almost too
              seriously.  He wears a commando belt loaded with a survival
              knife, devil darts and his machete sheath.  Like his
              partners, he too is a sore loser.  As he hacks away, he
              mumbles curses about this "stupid game."
 
              He raises the machete higher as he attacks the defenseless
              bushes.  SUDDENLY, A HORRIBLY DISFIGURED HAND GRABS HIS HAND,
              STOPPING THE MACHETE IN MID-SWING.
 
              Shocked, Burt whips around, and gasps at the masked Jason.
 
              ANGLE ON MACHETE
 
              Jason's iron grip turns the hunter's hand with the machete
              toward his bug-eyed face.  Jason forces the helpless man to
              stare at the weapon in his own hand that's about to take his
              life.  He then PLUNGES the razor-sharp blade through his neck!
 
              GROUND LEVEL
 
              Burt's corpse drops before us.  The gaping wound through his
              throat bubbles out bloody air bubbles.  His eyes stare
              lifelessly at us.

              LOW ANGLE - UP ON MARTIN
 
              The crusty old CARETAKER stares down in utter horror. His
              bloodshot, alcoholic eyes widen at what they see.
 
                                  MARTIN
                        Oh, shit.  Shit-SHIT!
 
              WIDER
 
              He stands over Jason's dug-up grave, cursing at what has
              happened.

              ANGLE ON MARTIN
 
              Taking out a pint of Whiskey from his coat, he takes a strong
              slug and winces.  With hangover equilibrium, he paces,
              nervous and afraid.
 
                                  MARTIN
                        Oh-hh.  Why me?...I know he's
                        gonna blame me for this.
 
              Martin looks around quickly.  He decides to cover up the open
              grave.  He starts throwing all the evidence into the hole,
              then, grabbing the shovel, begins filling it in.
 
                                  MARTIN
                               (become more frightened)
                        Damn.  Why Jason?  Mothers could
                        have their pick...
                               (he gestures)
                        ...of any of these other graves.
 
              ANGLE DOWN ON OPEN GRAVE
 
              Shovel-loads of dirt and mud slam down on the coffin. Hawes'
              foot is seen sticking out of the casket.

                        Shitheads couldn't even stick him
                        back in right.  Well, I ain't
                        gonna touch the slimy sucker.

              He's beginning to sweat as he works faster.

                        He can't find out.  He'll think I
                        ain't doin' my job.  I need that
                        money...He won't find out...

                               (to deputy)
                        It's kinda frightening to think
                        that a kid like that can go so far
                        over the edge.  Jason really
                        screwed up the poor sonofabitch's
                        mind.

                        most...It's how far he'll go to

              In his ill-fighting fatigues, he dashes comically from behind
              one tree to another.  His foot catches in some vines and he
              takes a terrific pratfall.  The paint-pellet gun flies from
              his hand and vanishes into the fallen leaves.

              He scrambles on his hands and knees to find his weapon.
              Panicking he'll be seen and shot, Roy starts to whimper as he
              searches.

                        himself, I'm sure he's lost.
 
                                  STAN
                        Yeah, but the game's not over
                        until it's over.
 
                                  LARRY
                               (going along)
                        That's right.
 
              Katie starts to counter, when she thinks she hears something.
              She stops them abruptly.
 
                                  KATIE
                        Shh-hh.  Wait a second.  What was
                        that?
 
              Everyone freezes, listening very intently.  A LONG WAIT.
 
              HIGH ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN ON THEM
 
              All three stand stock-still, looking around and listening.
 
              TIGHT THREE SHOT
 
              Not hearing a thing, Stan relaxes.

                                  STAN
                        Ahh, nothing.
 
                                  KATIE
                               (loud whisper)
                        I could swear I heard...
 
              JASON SLAMS DOWN BEFORE THEM.
 
              REVERSE OVER THEIR SHOULDER
 
              Jason wants to play army, too.  He quickly withdraws the
              machete from his newly acquired commando belt.  With one
              violent slice, the blade slashes their throats.
 
              CLOSE ON ALL THREE FACES AND NECKS
 
              The razor-sharp machete opens up all three throats almost
              simultaneously.  It happens so fast, they barely have time to
              even gasp.
 
              REVERSE ANGLE
 
              THREE HANDS DROP OFF, FOLLOWED BY COLLAPSING BODIES.  Jason
              watches them fall, then looks up at something.
 
              JASON P.O.V.
 
              Terrified beyond belief is Roy!  He stands a few yards away
              in a small clearing.
 
              MOVING SHOT - ON JASON
 
              He wastes no time as he stalks the final hunter.
 
              PRESSING IN ON ROY
 
              So incredibly frightened, he doesn't think as he raises his
              gun at Jason and fires.
 
              ANGLE ON JASON
 
              The blood/red-paint pellet makes a direct hit on Jason's
              chest.  He stops and glances down at this annoying mess.
 
              CLOSE ON HIS MASKED FACE
 
              As he looks up at Roy, he is even more pissed off.  He LUNGES
              for him.
 
              ROY
 
              screams, drops the gun, and runs for his life.

              TRACKING SHOT - ON JASON
 
              He is hell-bent on catching this nerd.
 
              DOLLYING BACK - ON ROY
 
              Tears of terror are welling up as the poor guy races.  Jason
              is seen a short distance behind, machete poised and ready.
              Roy glances back quickly, then screams as he heads through
              the ugly charred forest.
 
                                  ROY
                        Oh, God, help me!  Somebody,
                        help!!  He's trying to kill me!!

              Tommy stares at the sign and the approaching turnoff.  He
              glances up in his rear-view mirror again.  Biting his lip, he
              decides to go for it.
 
              EXT. FOREST ROAD
 
              Tommy's pickup makes a sudden left turn and heads up the road

              Rick turns on the siren and the red lights.
 
              EXT. FOREST ROAD
 
              The police car SCREECHES left and roars after Tommy.
 
              INT. PICKUP
 
              Tommy gets nervous hearing the siren BLARING, but instead of
              pulling over, he speeds up.

                        I'm getting real tired of this
                        maniac.
 
                                  DEPUTY
                        Maybe we better call that
                        psychiatric clinic.

              EXT. FOREST ROAD (TOWARD CEMETERY)
 
              The sheriff's car accelerates and gains on the pickup.  The
              high-speed chase continues down the narrow dirt road.
 
              EXT. CEMETERY - MAIN GATE
 
              Tommy's old pickup SKIDS to a stop in front of the open
              gates.  He leaps out of the truck as the sheriff SCREECHES UP
              next to him.  We CRANE UP past the "Eternal Rest" sign as
              Tommy races into the old cemetery.  The sheriff and his
              deputy are running close behind.

              TOMMY
 
              sprints across the bone yard in the direction of Jason's
              grave.  In his eyes there is now the hope that they'll see
              he's telling the truth.
 
              HIS P.O.V.
 
              We HEAD toward where Jason's open grave was.
 
              DOLLY BACK - CLOSE ON TOMMY RUNNING
 
              He squints his eyes.  Maybe he's in the wrong area.  He slows
              down to look around.  TOMMY IS VIOLENTLY TACKLED BY THE
              SHERIFF.
 
              WIDER
 
              Angry and out of breath, the sheriff pins him down to cuff
              him.  Tommy struggles to get up.

                                  TOMMY
                        I gotta show you Jason's grave.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (clenching his teeth)
                        I've seen it.

                               (desperate)
                        Please, Sheriff.  You'll see we
                        dug it up.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE
 
              Finally handcuffing him, the sheriff yanks him to his feet.
              Gripping Tommy's arm with one hand, he points at something.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (sarcastically)
                        Well, he must've got chilly in the
                        night and pulled the dirt back
                        over.
 
              Tommy looks around to where the sheriff is pointing.  The boy
              is astounded by what he sees.
 
              TOMMY'S P.O.V.
 
              About twelve yards away are Jason's and his mother's
              tombstones.  From this distance, it is impossible to tell
              that the chunks of lawn over Jason's grave have been replaced.
 
              ANGLE ON TOMMY AND LAWMEN
 
              Tommy shakes his head in utter disbelief.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        That's not right.  Somebody
                        covered it up...
                               (going toward it)
                        ...I gotta see it...
 
              The sheriff yanks him back.  The deputy pulls his .357
              revolver with a laser scope attached.  He aims at Tommy's
              head.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (very icy)
                        Now see what you've done.  You've
                        made my deputy draw his revolver.
                        That could be a serious headache
                        for you.  He's been dyin' to try
                        out his new mail-order laser scope.

              The deputy presses his gun's grip.  Instantly a tiny, bright
              red beam appears on Tommy's temple.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        It's a damn impressive piece of
                        high-tech weaponry... Wherever the
                        red dot goes... a bullet is sure
                        to follow.
 
              CLOSE ON TOMMY AND LASER BEAM
 
              He stares, fearing for his life, at the stolid deputy.

                        What's the problem, Sheriff?
 
              WIDER ON SCENE
 
              The old caretaker rushes awkwardly toward them.  Immediately,
              the sheriff whips Tommy around.  He drags him back toward the
              car as Rick quickly holsters his gun.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Nothing, Martin.  Just a vagrant
                        kid.  We got it under control.
 
              TIGHTER ON GROUP
 
              As they leave, Tommy looks back at the old man.

                               (demanding)
                        Who covered up Jason's grave?!
 
              Martin stops abruptly and tries to hide his nervousness.

                        What!?  What are you talking about?
 
              The sheriff pulls Tommy along even faster.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Don't concern yourself, Martin.
                        This boy needs treatment.  We're
                        taking care of it.  Sorry for the
                        disturbance.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (screaming)
                        Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes
                        is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it
                        up!!

              ANGLE ON MARTIN
 
              He watches with extreme uneasiness as Tommy is thrown into
              the back of the squad car.  The deputy gets into Tommy's
              pickup and follows the sheriff's car.
 
              PRESS IN ON MARTIN
 
              Pulling out his near-empty bottle of Jack Daniel's, he downs
              it all.  With a noisy exhale, Martin glances back at Jason's
              grave.

                        ...Hell, what kinda butt-hole does
                        he think I am!

              darts, a bloody machete in his hand.  This undead killing
              machine keeps coming.  There's a slight fog moving in as
              night approaches.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. INTERSTATE HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON
 
              Off on the side of the road, Sheriff Garris opens his
              backseat door.  He pulls Tommy out of the vehicle.  Gruffly,
              he turns him around and uncuffs him.
 
              TIGHT ON TOMMY AND SHERIFF
 
              Whipping him back around, the Sheriff grabs him by his shirt
              and pulls him uncomfortably close.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        I don't find it amusing that the
                        nut house you belong in thinks
                        you're responsible enough to leave
                        here unescorted.  In fact, it
                        gripes my ass.
 
              Tommy just stares coldly into his eyes.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (letting him go)
                        You've been damn lucky, pisshead.
                        With all the grief you've caused
                        me and my partner, you should be
                        leaving wearing your balls as
                        earrings.
 
              THE DEPUTY
 
              walks up and slaps Tommy's car keys into his hand.  Tommy
              looks up, down at his keys, then back at the wicked, smiling
              deputy.
 
                                  DEPUTY
                        I think we should do it to him
                        anyway.
 
              The sheriff leans in and taps Tommy's earlobes with his index
              fingers.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Naw.  But if we see ol' Tommy ever
                        again... you can guarantee it.

              WIDER
 
              Both lawmen turn and climb back into their car.  Tommy waits
              there as they pull out and drive away.
 
              REVERSE ON TOMMY
 
              He watches as they disappear down the highway.  Slowly the
              boy's stubborn determination returns.  He rushes toward his
              old pickup.  Behind it, the SUN IS SETTING.

              The campgrounds are peaceful and quiet.  A foggy haze covers
              everything.  As tranquil as it seems, we feel uneasy.  Is
              somebody watching from the woods.

              Two rows of sleeping youngsters in their cots are seen.

              The same.  The little girls' faces reflect pleasant dreams.

              Paula and Sissy are seated at a card table, playing the board
              game CLUE.  Paula keeps looking toward the window, troubled
              by something.  Sissy rolls the die and moves her token along
              the board.

                               (excited)
                        Okay, okay.  I suggest that the
                        crime was committed in the
                        bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with
                        the knife.

                        Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm
                        tellin' ya, we can't play Clue

                        Why not?  I used to play it alone.
                        I love murder games.  Have you
                        ever played The Consulting
                        Detective?

                        No...Did Megan say when she's
                        coming back from her...visit?
 
                                  SISSY
                        Of course not.  She probably took
                        him a loaf of bread with a saw
                        hidden in it.  I still don't get
                        it.  Why him?  I mean, he's cute
                        alright, but...
 
              Paula smirks.

                               (quickly)
                        Isn't that enough?
 
              Sissy laughs and nods.
 
                                  SISSY
                        You're right.  And for the area,
                        that even makes him overqualified.
 
              Paula then reaches for the phone.  TIGHTEN IN ON HER.
 
                                  PAULA
                        I'm gonna call her at the ol' jail
                        house.  Maybe her dad has found
                        out what happened to Darren and
                        Lizbeth by now...
                               (she starts dialing)
                        ...I can't believe they haven't
                        called.  I say if they're not here
                        by morning, we send all the kids
                        home.  We're not prepared to run
                        this place by ourselves.
 
              SUDDENLY, A CHILD'S HORRIFIED SCREAMS ECHO THROUGH THE CAMP.
 
              ANGLE ON PAULA AND SISSY
 
              Hanging up the phone, Paula races out the door, followed by
              Sissy.

              INT. GIRL'S DORMITORY CABIN
 
              As Paula and Sissy burst in, a LITTLE GIRL in pajamas rushes
              toward them.  She points at a cot across the way.
 
                                  LITTLE GIRL
                               (terrified)
                        She saw a monster.

              She looks to where the little girl is pointing.
 
              PAULA'S P.O.V.
 
              Huddled up on her cot and pressed against the wall is NANCY.
              The sweet-faced nine-year-old is frightened out of her wits.
              Her big blue eyes are filled with tears.
 
              WIDER
 
              Behind Paula and Sissy, the other children stare wide-eyed at
              Nancy.  Paula approaches her gently.

                               (reassuringly)
                        Hi.  Everything's all right now.
                        We're here.
 
                                  SISSY
                               (awkwardly going along)
                        Yeah, we're here.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE
 
              Paula crouches down next to Nancy's cot.  Sissy stands next
              to her friend.  Nancy has still not stopped trembling.

                               (softly)
                        So what happened?
 
                                  NANCY
                               (holding back tears)
                        There was this monster.  He was
                        after me.  He wanted to kill me.
 
                                  SISSY
                        Where...?

                                  NANCY
                        Everywhere.

                               (shakes her head)
                        No, he was real.  Like on TV.
 
              CLOSE ON PAULA AND SISSY
 
              In motherly fashion, Paula wipes Nancy's tears and tucks her
              back under the blanket.
 
                                  PAULA
                        Okay, listen...what's your name,

                        night so nothing can hurt you.
                        Okay?...
 
              The child nods tentatively.
 
                                  PAULA
                        ...Good.  So no more bad dreams
                        can come around here, huh?
 
                                  NANCY
                               (faintly)
                        No more.
 
              Paula smiles lovingly at her, then stands.
 
              WIDER
 
              As Paula and Sissy start to leave, Sissy gets cocky
              addressing the others.
 
                                  SISSY
                        Now you all go back to Z-land.
                        We're on the job and ya don't have
                        to worry about shit...

              Paula nudges her for her choice of language.
 
                                  SISSY
                        ...What?  I'm sure they hear worse
                        at home.
 
              REACHING THE DOOR
 
              Paula looks outside, then turns to Sissy.

                               (quietly)
                        I just realized something.
                        Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him
                        for hours.

                        I don't know.  He called somebody,
                        then took off.
 
                                  PAULA

              She moans and bites her lip with erotic pleasure, never
              missing a beat with the music.  Jill even bumps and grinds
              perfectly to the song's drum breaks.

              Jill bends forward, laying her soft breasts on his chest.
              She whispers seductively in his ear:

                        Only ten more minutes.

              The RV's bright lights, music and bouncing instantly retard
              and CEASE.
 
                                  JILL'S VOICE
                        Oh, fuck.
 
                                  CORT'S VOICE
                               (passion relieved)
                        Oh ye-aaah.
 
              INT. MOBILE-HOME
 
              Dim moonlight spills in through the windows.  Jill jumps off
              Cort and starts to investigate the problem.
 
                                  JILL
                        Wait a second, I'll...
                               (realizing, angrily)
                        ...Cort, you didn't already...
 
              CORT
 
              sits quickly.
 
                                  CORT
                               (defensively)
                        I thought that was the end of the
                        song.

                        Great.  Just great.
 
              She stumbles through the RV.  Shivering, she puts on her coat
              and heads to the AC power switch.
 
                                  JILL
                        If this thing is burned out,
                        friggin' Horace will ground my
                        butt.
 
                                  CORT
                        Who's Horace?

                               (disgusted)
                        My friggin' stepfather and asshole-
                        in-residence.

              Jill flips the switch a couple times.  Nothing.  She presses
              her face against the window and looks out.
 
              JILL'S P.O.V.
 
              The power cord is seen laying on the ground below.
 
                                  JILL
                        How did that happen?
 
              CORT
 
              has pulled the blankets around himself to fight the cold.
 
                                  CORT
                        What?

                               (almost demanding)
                        Go out and plug the cord back in.
 
                                  CORT
                        What?  Who pulled it out?!
 
              Jill stomps toward him.
 
                                  JILL
                               (sarcastically)
                        Smokey the friggin' bear.  I don't
                        know, just do it.
 
              ANGLE ON CORT
 
              Nervously, he starts to get dressed.
 
              EXT. MOBILE-HOME
 
              The door opens tentatively.  Cort sticks his head out and
              slowly looks around.
 
                                  JILL (O.S.)
                        Will you hurry up!  I gotta get
                        this fuckmobile back before Horace
                        finds out I took it.
 
                                  CORT
                               (jumping out)
                        Alright, alright.
 
              We TRACK with Cort as he walks around the RV, watching
              everything around him.  It's getting tense.

              ANOTHER ANGLE
 
              Apprehensively, Cort approaches the cord and picks it up.  He
              keeps staring out at the surrounding drifting fog.
 
              PRESSING IN ON CORT
 
              Without looking at it, the jittery boy starts to plug in the
              cord.  He then notices the torn-out plug and frayed cord.
              Cort gasps.  He turns to call to Jill.  HE BANGS INTO SOMEONE
              RIGHT BEHIND HIM...it's Jill.
 
                                  JILL
                               (irritated)
                        What are you doing?...
                               (seeing the cord)
                        ...What happened to it?
 
              ANGLE ON BOTH
 
              Cort hands her the damaged cord.
 
                                  CORT
                               (very scared)
                        I don't know...
                               (he heads for the door)
                        ...But unless you wanna look
                        exactly like it, I say we make
                        this place a memory.
 
              Jill looks down at it.
 
              INSERT - CORD
 
              Close up, the horribly ripped and torn cord end does look
              quite grotesque.
 
              BACK TO JILL
 
              She cans the foggy night and a deadly fear now grips her.
              Slowly, then picking up speed, she follows after Cort.
 
              CORT
 
              has stopped in the RV's doorway.  Jill rushes up, and turns
              to look at what he's staring at.
 
                                  CORT
                               (straining to see)
                        I think someone's out there.

              CORT'S P.O.V.
 
              The woods are still, with the exception of the drifting fog.
              Is that a tree in the shadows, or...?
 
              JILL
 
              pushes him into the mobile home.
 
                                  JILL
                               (scared)
                        I don't wanna know.
 
              She climbs in, slams the door, and LOCKS it.
 
              INT. MOBILE-HOME
 
              Cort jumps into the driver's seat.  He tries to start the
              car.  IT'S DEAD.  He looks at Jill in terror.
 
                                  CORT
                        This can't be.
 
              Jill shakes her head at him.
 
                                  JILL
                        It isn't.
 
              She calmly turns the power switch over to "BATTERY".
 
              CORT
 
              tries the ignition again.  It starts up.  He grins at her.
 
                                  JILL
                               (impatiently)
                        Are you gonna drive or not?
 
              Quickly he shifts and ROARS backward.  Jill is thrown to the
              floor.  Items fall off the counters.
 
              EXT. MOBILE-HOME CAMPGROUND
 
              In a cloud of dust, the huge RV races backwards.
 
              MOVING SHOT - FROM BEHIND THE TREES
 
              We FOLLOW AFTER the vehicle as it peels out of the
              campgrounds.

              INT. MOBILE-HOME
 
              Jill is now sent flying back toward the camper.  She lands on
              the bed.  She sends a burning stars at the back of Cort's
              head.
 
              HER P.O.V.
 
              Cort LAUGHS LOUDLY as he races down the bumpy dirt road.
 
              JILL
 
              tries to control her temper.  Enough things have gone wrong
              tonight without having this idiot destroy her old man's RV.

              as she heads toward him.  WITHOUT WARNING, JASON EXPLODES OUT
              OF THE BATHROOM.  He yanks her to him.  The door slams shut
              on them.

              His head bobs enthusiastically to the LOUD ROCK MUSIC.  He

              Jill, he turns around and looks.
 
              CORT'S P.O.V.
 
              Jill is not there.  But a RUCKUS can be HEARD coming from the

              Jason's viselike grip squeezes her throat.  She gasps and
              gags as his fingers begin to meet.  Her nose bleeds.

              His soulless eyes stare down at her from behind the mask.

                        Hey, what are you doing?  Taking
                        a dump?... How about if I come
                        back and snatch a peek.  Or vice
                        versa.
 
              As he cackles with amusement, JASON THROWS OPEN THE DOOR.
              Cort doesn't hear it.  Menacingly, JASON STALKS HIM.
 
              CLOSE ON JASON'S COMMANDO BELT
 
              His hand pulls out the long, jagged survival knife.  He holds
              it poised and ready.

              Slowly, the infamous slasher closes in on Cort.

              behind him.

              A new SONG plays on the radio.  Cort beams, recognizing it as

              JASON'S HOCKEY-MASKED FACE GLARES AT HIM.
 
              CORT RECOILS IN HORROR.
 
              JASON'S HAND GRABS HIM BY THE HAIR.
 
              THE GLEAMING BLADE RAISES UP.
 
              CLOSE ON BACK OF CORT'S HEAD AS THE JAGGED KNIFE PLUNGES INTO

              We watch in EERIE SILENCE as Jason lets go of Cort's knifed
              head.  The lifeless body flops over the wheel.  Immediately,
              the RV veers off to the left.

                        ...Can you hold on?  He's in the
                        can draining his lizard.

              SHERIFF GARRIS
 
              slams the door and roars toward his precocious daughter.
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (sweetly into phone)

                        ...Daddy, it's Rick.
 
              The growling sheriff practically rips the receiver out of
              snickering Megan's hand.

              Deputy Colone stands outside his squad car.  Talking into the

              floating corpse in the background.

                        You better get down here.  I found
                        what's left of the counselors.
                        Looks like someone did them in

              Megan grows concerned as her father gathers his things with
              a deadly urgency.
 
                                  MEGAN

                        Not what...who.  Seems your
                        boyfriend wants people to believe
                        Jason has returned.

                        He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove
                        the legend is true...

                        kidding.
 
              Grabbing his rifle, the sheriff rushes out.

              Megan sits alone at the desk...waiting.  A large window is
              right behind her.  Bored, she puts her feet on the edge of
              the desk.  She then leans back toward the window, seeing how
              far back the chair will go and still stay balanced.

              pratfalls backwards.

              He looks around, shivers and zips up his jacket.  He's

              We FOLLOW the light over a couple of yards to a HACKED-OFF
              LEG, also in fatigues.

                        Looks like our boy desperately
                        wants us to believe his story.

              The magazine is filled with beefcake-posing guys.  She is

              turn away, when the SOUND of LEAVES CRUNCHING underfoot is
              HEARD.  She sticks her head out the window.  She tries to

                               (falling asleep)
                        ...Teach him a lesson.
 
              BACK TO SISSY
 
              She HEARS FOOTSTEPS right below the window.  She thinks, then
              breaks into an impish grin, seeing something.  Sissy quietly
              tiptoes over to the table and picks up her half-consumed can
              of "Cherry Coke."
 
              MOVING SHOT
 
              Sissy, trying not to laugh, sneaks back to the window.  She
              crouches down, then extends the can outside.
 
              CLOSE ON CAN
 
              Her hands turn it over and sticky "Cherry Coke" pours down on
              her victim.  We HEAR IT HITTING SOMEONE.
 
              ANGLE ON SISSY
 
              Quickly she withdraws the can and jumps back from the window.
              Expecting a response, she is surprised not to get one.
              Stifling a laugh, she creeps back toward the window.
 
              DOLLY IN - SLOWLY FOLLOWING SISSY
 
              Tension mounts as she reaches the frame and tentatively peers
              over it.  SHOCKINGLY, JASON SPRINGS UP AND GRABS HER.
 
              PROFILE ANGLE - ON WINDOW
 
              Bottom half of Sissy's body is WHIPPED VIOLENTLY OUT THROUGH
              THE WINDOW.
 
              PAULA AWAKENS
 
              just as Sissy's legs fly out through the window.

                                  PAULA
                               (groggy)
                        Hey, you guys.  Try got to wake
                        the kids.
 
              Paula listens.  She HEARS a STRUGGLE, a WHOOSH, a THUMP, then
              SILENCE.  She snickers once again, then falls back into
              dreamland.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              EXT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT
 
              Megan's orange Camaro SCREECHES UP.  We FOLLOW as she jumps
              out and is met by Tommy.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (adamantly)
                        I'm gonna borrow your car.  You
                        can't do this with me.  It's much
                        too dangerous.
 
              She looks past him at his pickup.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        And you can't leave that truck out
                        in plain sight.  Talk about
                        dangerous.
 
              Tommy turns around to look.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        What?
 
                                  MEGAN
                        Hide it behind the gas station.
                        Then we can get the hell out of
                        here.
 
              He turns back to her.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (irritated)
                        Look, this isn't a game.  You're
                        not going with me.  I'm already
                        responsible for causing the death
                        of...
 
              Megan cuts him off.
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (quickly)
                        Didn't you say you needed some
                        supplies to do this?

                                  TOMMY
                        Uh...yes.  But...
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (firmly)
                        Then let's get goin'.  We can
                        argue on the way.  You tell me
                        what you need...
                               (with a sly smile)
                        ...I'll make sure you get in.
 
              She heads toward her LOUDLY PURRING Camaro.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        ...And nobody drives this baby but
                        me...
                               (pointing)
                        ...Now get that pickup hid and
                        let's boog.
 
              ANGLE ON TOMMY
 
              There isn't much he can say.  With an exasperated sigh, he
              runs to move his truck.

              SLOWLY we TRACK along a row of sleeping children.  Each has

              her large windows just above them beaming in moonlight.

              We FOLLOW Jason's evil shadow as it crosses more sleeping
              kids.  When it falls across little Nancy, her half-open eyes
              flash open!  She sits up in wide-eyed fear as we rapidly
              PRESS IN on her.

                        Can this tub go any faster?

              She returns a flirtatious grin.

                               (self-assured)
                        You got it.  Just keep an eye out
                        for roadblocks.

                        Okay.  There's one.
 
              THEIR P.O.V. - THROUGH WINDSHIELD
 
              As they round the bend, two police cars with lights a-
              flashin' are blocking the road.

              delivers.  Grabbing his head, she pulls it down onto her lap.

                               (forcefully)

              The Camaro fires past us.  One cop car, then the other,
              follow suit.  All three vehicles' tires SQUEAL on the
              hazardous curves.

              ANGLE ON TOMMY
 
              Megan's wild driving causes his head to roll around in her
              lap.  He tries to be discreet about where it keeps landing.
 
                                  MEGAN (O.S.)
                        That's what I want.
 
              Tommy registers surprise.

              Two signposts are seen.  One reads "Cunningham Road," the
              other "Camp Forest Green" with an arrow pointing right.

              Her car SCREAMS around the turn onto Cunningham Road.
              SHOCKINGLY, HER FATHER AND HIS CAR ARE WAITING IN THE DARK
              FOR THEM.  The deputy and his car are right behind the
              sheriff.  Both have their rifles aimed and ready.
 
              EXT. FOREST ROAD
 
              Megan's car barely has enough room to brake.  The Camaro
              fishtails to a stop.  The sheriff remains stock-still, not
              flinching at all.
 
              PRESS IN - ON SHERIFF
 
              With a deadly cool, her orders his daughter:

                        Megan, step out of the car!

              ANGLE ON MEGAN - THROUGH WINDSHIELD
 
              She stares in horror at her father.  She's never seen him
              point a gun at her.  But then again she's never pulled a
              stunt like this.  Megan then looks down at her feet.

              He is sprawled across the floorboard, his face between

                                  MEGAN
                        It's all over.

              Little Nancy stands over Paula, holding the machete.

                                  NANCY
                        I can't sleep, Paula.  I'm scared.
                        I saw someone at the window and...
 
              Paula sits up quickly and grabs the disgusting machete.
 
                                  PAULA
                               (interrupting)
                        Where'd you get this?
 
                                  NANCY
                               (pointing)
                        I found it outside.
 
              Paula doesn't know what to think.  Looking around the cabin
              and not seeing anyone, she draws some rapid conclusions.
 
                                  PAULA
                               (trying to sound comforting)
                        You know what?  Sissy and Cort are
                        playing jokes.  You know, trying
                        to scare each other.
 
                                  NANCY
                               (innocently)
                        Why?
 
                                  PAULA
                        Well, grown-ups think it's funny
                        to be scared.
 
                                  NANCY
                               (confused)
                        Are they grown-ups?
 
                                  PAULA
                        That's debatable.
 
                                  NANCY
                               (more confused)
                        Huh?
 
              Paula shakes her head, puts the machete down on the floor,
              and stands up.
 
                                  PAULA
                        Never mind...
                               (looks at watch)
                        ...Is it that lake already?
 
              She grabs the phone and starts to dial.

                                  PAULA
                        I can't believe no one called
                        back.  I better...
 
                                  NANCY
                        Who ya calling?
 
              PAULA
 
              realizes the child doesn't need to hear this conversation.
              She hangs up.
 
                                  PAULA
                        Why don't we first try and find
                        Sissy and Cort, then you can go to
                        sleep.
 
              She takes Nancy's hand and they head for the door.
 
                                  NANCY
                               (worried)
                        But what if they try and scare us?
 
                                  PAULA
                               (playfully)
                        We'll scare 'em right back.
 
              Nancy giggles with delight.  They exit the cabin door.
 
              EXT. CAMP FOREST GREEN
 
              Paula leads Nancy down the steps.  She makes a game out of
              quietly sneaking around, looking for the missing counselors.
              For the child, this is fun.
 
              WITHOUT WARNING, JASON'S MASKED FACE IS BEFORE US.  A STING

              In the dark shadows, Jason watches the two giggling girls.
              He waits for his moment.  For Jason, this is fun.

                                  SHERIFF
                        Yeah...They should've paid their
                        bill.
 
              In the background we HEAR a CALL coming in on the radio.
              Deputy Colone is HEARD answering it.  The sheriff points at
              Tommy.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (icy hatred)

              We TRACK with the sheriff over to the deputy on the radio
              headset.

                        ...Approximately what time?
                               (he glares in Tommy's
                                direction)
                        ...I'll be right there.
 
              We FOLLOW the sheriff as he grabs his coat and hat to leave.
              Megan runs up to him.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        What?...What happened?!
 
              Her father looks past her to his deputy.

                               (to Rick)
                        And make sure my daughter stays
                        put...
                               (looking at Megan)
                        ...She's grounded.
 
              Megan steps in his path as he turns to go.  She pushes
              against his chest as hard as she can.
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (exploding)
                        Tell me!!
 
              The sheriff immediately raises his hand to strike her.  Then,
              quickly controlling himself, he grabs her by the shoulders.

                                  SHERIFF
                               (clenching teeth)
                        They just found your friend Cort
                        and some girl.  She was brutally
                        strangled, and Cort...he had a
                        knife rammed through his skull.
 
              Megan shakes her head in disbelief.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        No.  No, it's not...
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a
                        killer.  A very deranged boy who
                        wants you to believe that...
 
              ANGLE ON TOMMY
 
                                  TOMMY
                        Jason did do it.  I swear!
                        Sheriff, when were they murdered?
 
              BACK TO MEGAN AND SHERIFF
 
              He disregards Tommy's question and stares at his daughter
              with sincere concern.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        For God's sake, stat away from
                        him.  Please, Meggie.
 
              As he starts again to leave, Megan, still in shock from the
              news, grabs her father's arm.
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (intensely)
                        Dad...What time were they murdered?
 
              The sheriff hesitates, not wanting to answer.  Somehow it
              blurts out:
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        They think somewhere around 8:30
                        or 9:00.
 
              MEGAN
 
              steps right up to her father.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        I was with Tommy all that time.

              CLOSE ON SHERIFF
 
              This obviously hits him on more than one level.  He masks his
              reaction, turns, and heads for the door.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Rick, I'll call you when I get
                        there.
 
              He exits and slams the door.
 
              MEGAN
 
              with sorrowful eyes, looks back at Tommy.
 
              TOMMY
 
              slams both fists against the bars.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        Damn.

              INT. GIRL'S DORMITORY CABIN - NIGHT
 
              Paula and Nancy are tiptoeing, trying not to awaken the other
              children.  Reaching little Nancy's bed, Paula tucks her in
              snugly.  She crouches next to the child.
 
                                  PAULA
                               (whispering)
                        I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back
                        in their cabins.  So you just go
                        back to sleep and don't worry.
 
                                  NANCY
                        But what I get scared again?
 
                                  PAULA
                               (whispering)
                        Shhh...You know what I used to do
                        when I was a little girl when I
                        got scared?
 
              Nancy shakes her head timidly.
 
                                  PAULA
                               (whispering)
                        I would close my eyes and say a
                        little prayer.  And pretty soon,
                        you know what?  Everything scary
                        went away...
                               (reassuringly)
                        ...It worked for me.  I'll bet
                        it'll work for you too.
 
              She kisses the child's forehead.
 
                                  PAULA
                               (lovingly)
                        Good night.  See ya in the morning.
 
              REVERSE ON PAULA
 
              As she stands up, we see JASON GLARING AT THEM THROUGH THE
              WINDOW.  Paula smiles tenderly at Nancy.
 
              PAULA'S P.O.V.
 
              Nancy smiles back at her, rolls over, and closes her eyes.
 
              TRACKING SHOT - ON PAULA
 
              She begins to quietly head for the door.  JASON FOLLOWS RIGHT
              ALONG OUTSIDE FROM WINDOW TO WINDOW.
 
              EXT. CAMP FOREST GREEN
 
              Paula exits the dormitory door as silently as possible.  She
              looks around the area, still very concerned about her
              companions.
 
              PAULA'S P.O.V.
 
              A gently breeze is blowing away the evening fog.  The trees
              and brushes seem to shiver nervously.
 
              PRESS IN - ON PAULA
 
              as she slowly descends the steps.  Somehow she can sense her
              deadly face.  Paula looks around again, then hurries toward
              her cabin.

              Paula races across the camp to the counselor's cabin.
 
              MOVING SHOT - OVER HER SHOULDER
 
              She rushes up the cabin steps and finds the door closed.  She
              seems relieved.
 
                                  PAULA
                        Sissy?

              INT. COUNSELOR'S CABIN
 
              As Paula enters, she is disappointed to find it empty.
 
              TIGHTEN ON PAULA
 
              She hurries to the phone and starts dialing.  For the first
              time, she realizes the phone is dead.  Her frustration turns
              to alarm when she notices something at her feet.
 
              PAULA'S P.O.V.
 
              THE MACHETE SHE LEFT ON THE FLOOR IS GONE.  BLOODY STAINS ON
              THE FLOOR MARK WHERE IT HAD LAIN.
 
              PAULA
 
              hears a NOISE and turns to look.
 
              ANGLE ON OPEN DOOR
 
              It moves a bit.  Was it the wind or is someone behind it?
 
              MOVING SHOT - ON PAULA
 
              Not sure if it's a joke or her imagination, Paula slowly
              heads towards it.  Tension mounts.  Just as she reaches it,
              she slowly extends her hand to grab the knob.  SUDDENLY, THE
              WIND BLOWS IT TOWARD HER.  She backs up.  It slams shut.  No
              one, of course, is there.  She giggles at herself and reopens
              the door.  JASON IS RIGHT THERE IN THE DOORWAY.

              A few yards from the cabin, we watch as Jason quickly lunges
              at Paula and SLAMS the door, MUFFLING her SCREAM.

              INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT
 
              Deputy Colone is hunched over his desk, doing what he hates
              most...filling out reports.  He glances up at Tommy, then
              over at Megan.  Satisfied, he returns to his shitwork.
 
              ANGLE ON MEGAN
 
              Seated across the room, she appears to be idly sketching
              something on a large pad.

              TOMMY
 
              sits on his jail cot, head in hands, hopeless.
 
              MEGAN
 
              looks up at the deputy, then over at Tommy.
 
              CLOSE ON TOMMY
 
              He glances up at her.
 
              OVER MEGAN'S SHOULDER - ON TOMMY
 
              She holds up the sketch pad for him to read.  As she does,
              his eyes widen, amazed at what she's written.  He mouths "Are
              you sure?" as she lowers the pad.
 
              TIGHT ON MEGAN
 
              She nods a strong affirmative.
 
              WIDE ON SCENE
 
              Tommy gets up off his cot and stretches nonchalantly.  He
              eyes the deputy, then Megan.  She flips a page over, and
              starts to really sketch.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        So what are ya drawin'?
 
                                  MEGAN
                        What's it to ya?
 
              THE DEPUTY
 
              looks up, irritated by the noise.
 
                                  DEPUTY
                        Hey, pipe down, Jarvis.
 
              TOMMY
 
              grabs the cell bars.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        I was just curious about what she
                        was drawin'.
 
              MEGAN
 
              holds it up for Tommy to see.

                                  MEGAN
                               (sarcastic)
                        There...Ya happy?
 
                                  TOMMY
                        No.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        Why?
 
                                  TOMMY
                        'Cause it stinks.
 
              Megan throws the sketch pad at him.  It bounces off the bars.
 
              ANGLE ON TOMMY
 
              He reaches down, grabs it, and pulls it into his cell.
 
              MEGAN
 
              stands up defiantly.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        Okay, give it back.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (slyly)
                        Come and get it.
 
              ANGLE ON DEPUTY
 
              This is really getting him pissed.  He gets up.
 
                                  DEPUTY
                        Bastard...Megan, I'll get in.
 
              MEGAN
 
              is already in front of the wall.  She reaches through the
              bars for the pad.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        Give it to me, punk.
 
              TIGHT ON TOMMY AND MEGAN
 
              Suddenly he grabs her arm, pulls her to the bars, and starts
              kissing her passionately.  The more she struggles, the
              tighter he envelopes her.

              MOVING SHOT - ON DEPUTY
 
              He races across the room.  Awkwardly, he grapples to separate
              them.
 
              INSERT - DEPUTY'S REVOLVER
 
              As they battle, Megan's hand secretly reaches down and pulls
              the gun from the deputy's holster.
 
              ANGLE ON GROUP
 
              Megan allows herself to be torn from Tommy's embrace.  The
              angry deputy reaches at Tommy, who backs away into the cell.
 
                                  DEPUTY
                        You stinkin' maggot, I oughta...!
 
                                  MEGAN (O.S.)
                               (demanding)
                        Let him out of there.
 
              PRESS IN - ON DEPUTY
 
              As he turns to face Megan, a red laser dot appears on the tip
              of his nose.
 
              DEPUTY P.O.V.
 
              Megan points the laser-scoped revolver right at us.  She
              definitely means business.
 
              TIGHT ON DEPUTY
 
              He chuckles in disbelief.
 
                                  DEPUTY
                        Come on, Megan, don't clown around.
 
              MEGAN
 
              holds the gun dead-steady.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        I ain't the one with the funny red
                        nose...Open the cell and exchange
                        places...with him...
                               (she cocks the trigger)
                        ...Now.
 
              ANGLE ON DEPUTY AND TOMMY
 
              The boy moves up behind him and reinforces the seriousness of
              the situation.

                                  TOMMY
                               (enjoying this)
                        Better do as she says, 'cause
                        ...wherever the red dot goes, a
                        bullet is sure to follow.
 
              The deputy reluctantly removes his keys and turns toward
              Tommy.
 
                                  DEPUTY
                               (furiously)
                        You brainwashed her, you
                        sonofabitch?
 
              MEGAN
 
              breaks into a cocky smile, and answers for him.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        Yeah, something like that.

                        Got the keys?
 
              MEGAN
 
              reaches under the car and quickly withdraws a tiny box.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        No, he took 'em...But I got my
                        Hide-a-Key.
 
              TOMMY
 
              rushes up and grabs it from her.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.

                        I thank you for getting me out.
                        But I gotta finish what I started.

              MEGAN
 
              stares defiantly at him as she opens the driver's door and
              gets in.  She suddenly slides over to the passenger's seat.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        Well, come on, hot lips, let's go.
                        You drive, I'll navigate.

              Tommy throws up his hands, then climbs in.  The car starts up
              and ROARS down the street.

              JASON
 
              reaches the end of the dormitory.  With his back to us, he

              Although we can't see anyone in the WIND-RUSTLED bushes, we
              sense Jason is watching the lone cop.
 
              TIGHT ON JASON'S COMMANDO BELT
 
              His hand withdraws a long, razor-sharp devil dart.
 
              ANGLE ON OFFICER
 
              With his back to us, the unsuspecting cop concludes his
              search of the landing and turns around.  His flashlight now
              focuses on the woods before him.
 
              PAN ACROSS SHADOWED WOODS
 
              We FOLLOW the flashlight beam as it surveys the windswept
              area.  JASON IS ILLUMINATED!  He raises up the sinister dart.
 
              TIGHT ON OFFICER
 
              Recognizing a weapon in this prowler's hand, he goes for his
              revolver.
 
              CLOSE ON JASON'S ARM
 
              With supernatural strength, he throws the deadly projectile
              at us.
 
              ANGLE ON OFFICER
 
              Before he can pull his gun, THE DEVIL IMPALES ITSELF DEEP
              INTO HIS FOREHEAD.  The force of it sends him reeling back.
 
              THE TARP-COVERED BOAT
 
              Officer Thornton's body falls into it.  His lifeless eyes
              stare up at the sky.  The dart extends from his third eye.

              The panicked sheriff now rushes across to the girls' dorm.
 
              INT. GIRL'S DORMITORY CABIN
 
              As silently as possible, he opens the door and peeks it.  He
              carefully surveys all the slumbering occupants.  The sheriff
              suddenly registers alarm.

              All the girls are nestled contentedly in their beds...except
              one.  The covers have been kicked off and her pillow lies on

              Megan, sitting shotgun, stares open-mouthed at Tommy.

                               (sarcastically)
                        Let me know when you're about to
                        blast into hyperspace.  I'll
                        fasten my seat belt.
 
              TOMMY
 
              drives like a man possessed.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        I got a bad feeling we're already
                        too late.
 
              Megan glances back at the large sack in the rear seat.  She
              reaches over and looks in at his supplies doubtfully.

                                  MEGAN
                        Are you sure this is gonna work?
                        I mean, why didn't we bring that
                        gun and just blast him away?
 
              ANGLE ON BOTH
 
                                  TOMMY
                        It probably wouldn't have any
                        effect on him.  The only sure way
                        to stop Jason is to return him to
                        his original resting place, where
                        he drowned in 1957.

              The infamous lake is churning in the moonlight.  RACK FOCUS
              as Officer Pappas steps before us.  It's apparent that he's
              getting tired of searching for God-knows-what.
 
              TRACK WITH OFFICER
 
              His flashlight scans the windblown, vibrating bushes.
              Suddenly, FOOTSTEPS are HEARD on the other side of the bushes.
 
              ANGLE ON OFFICER
 
              He stops abruptly and strains to listen.  Tentatively, he
              creeps toward the bushes.
 
              OFFICER'S P.O.V.
 
              We HEAD toward whatever is hiding behind the trembling
              shrubbery.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE - ON OFFICER PAPPAS
 
              Reaching the brushes, he calls out:
 
                                  OFFICER PAPPAS
                        Alright, come out of there!

              ANGLE ON BUSHES
 
              No reply.
 
              BACK ON OFFICER
 
              He draws his revolver and aims it.  He knows someone's there.
 
                                  OFFICER PAPPAS
                        I'm askin' you one more time
                        ...come out of there!
 
              Still no response.
 
              MOVING SHOT - FOLLOWING OFFICER
 
              With his gun held before him, the nervous officer goes for a
              closer look.
 
              TIGHT ON HIS FACE
 
              Tension builds as he comes closer.
 
              RESUME ON MOVING SHOT - FOLLOWING HIM
 
              He is almost to the bushes.  WITHOUT WARNING, SOMEONE DIVES
              BEFORE US AND ATTACKS HIS LEG.  He gasps aloud.
 
              ANGLE ON OFFICER AND NANCY
 
              The frightened child holds on to Pappas for dear life.  He
              catches his breath, then crouches down next to her.
 
                                  OFFICER PAPPAS
                               (kindly)
                        Hey, hey, what are you doing
                        running around out here?  Now you
                        get back to bed.
 
              She squeezes his leg even tighter.
 
                                  NANCY
                               (terrified)
                        No.  There's a scary man.
 
              The good-looking officer smiles with amusement.
 
                                  OFFICER PAPPAS
                        What scary man?
 
              JASON EXPLODES OUT OF THE BUSHES.
 
              NANCY RUNS SHRIEKING TOWARD THE CAMP.

              OFFICER PAPPAS OPENS FIRE ON JASON.
 
              THE BULLETS PENETRATE HIS CHEST, BUT HE KEEPS COMING.
 
              ANGLE ON OFFICER
 
              Suddenly Jason is before him.  His powerful hand reaches out
              and grabs the officer's SCREAMING face.
 
              TIGHT ON OFFICER'S FACE
 
              JASON'S FINGERS DIG IN TO THE COP'S SKIN.  HE YANKS DOWN,
              LITERALLY RIPPING THE SKIN OFF HIS SKULL.
 
              A BLOODY GRINNING SKULL STARES AT US FOR A MOMENT, THEN DROPS
              FROM VIEW.

              his shotgun.
 
              WIDER
 
              Leaving the door open, he sprints across the camp towards the
              gunshots.
 
              MOVING SHOT - ON SHERIFF
 
              As he rounds the corner of a cabin, Nancy comes SCREECHING
              toward him.  He catches the child and attempts to comfort her.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Hold on.  Take it easy.  I got
                        you.  Everything is fine.
 
              ANGLE ON SHERIFF AND NANCY
 
              As he hugs her, he looks up at the boys' dormitory cabin.

              All the children are pressed against the windows, staring
              down terrified.
 
              WIDER
 
              Quickly, the sheriff picks Nancy up and heads for the cabin.

              INT. BOY'S DORMITORY CABIN
 
              Sheriff Garris bursts into the cabin.  All the girls have
              gathered in the boys' cabin for safety.  He puts little Nancy
              down and addresses the petrified youngsters.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Kids, listen to me very carefully.
                        I want everyone to lie down on the
                        floor and stay there.  Do not get
                        up until I come back.  Now hurry.
 
              VARIOUS SHOTS OF KIDS HITTING THE FLOOR
 
              Some cover their heads, others crawl under the cots.
 
              INT. CAMP FOREST GREEN - NIGHT
 
              The sheriff runs out of the children's cabin, securing the
              door behind him.
 
              TIGHT ON SHOTGUN IN HIS HANDS
 
              He pumps the weapon as he walks.
 
              ANGLE UP - ON SHERIFF - DOLLYING BACK
 
              With stern vigilance, he storms toward his objective.
 
              SHERIFF GARRIS
 
              arrives in the area behind the cabins near the lake.  There
              is no one to be found.  The savage wind whips the trees and
              bushes, causing the sheriff to twitch at every movement.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE
 
              Slowly, he turns and heads into the shadowed area between the
              cabins.
 
              MOVING SHOT - ON SHERIFF
 
              With the shotgun held before him, he walks tensely through
              this dark passage.
 
              TIGHT ON HIS FACE
 
              The sheriff's eyes dart nervously, straining to see in the
              near blackness.  Suddenly, he trips and falls from view.
 
              ANGLE ON SHERIFF FALLING
 
              Rapidly, we TILT DOWN as he slams down on Officer Pappas'
              corpse.

              THE SHERIFF'S FACE LANDS PRESSED AGAINST THE GROTESQUE BLOODY
              SKULL.  Horribly repulsed, he scrambles to his feet.
 
              THE SHERIFF
 
              stands up, turns, and JASON IS WAITING RIGHT THERE.
 
              WIDER
 
              Quickly, he backs away from this masked spectre of evil.
              Then they both stands motionless for a long time, sizing each
              other up.
 
              LOW ANGLE - ON JASON
 
              He decides to make the first move.  He lunges forward.
 
              LOW ANGLE - ON SHERIFF
 
              Instantly, he raises the shotgun and BLASTS Jason with both
              barrels!
 
              ANGLE ON JASON'S TORSO
 
              A hole is ripped out of Jason's side!

              IT DOESN'T FAZE HIM AT ALL.  HE KEEPS COMING.
 
              DOLLY TOWARD THE SHERIFF
 
              Shocked beyond belief, the sheriff drops the rifle and pulls
              out his .357.  Backing up, he empties the chamber into the
              stalking ghoul.
 
              ANGLE BEHIND JASON
 
              As he advances on the firing sheriff, we see THE BULLETS
              EXITING FROM JASON'S BACK.
 
              TIGHT ON JASON CLOSING IN
 
              All this is only making him madder.
 
              TIGHT ON TERRIFIED SHERIFF
 
              His gun CLICKING empty, he has but one option left.  He takes
              it.  The sheriff turns and runs like hell toward the woods!
              JASON IS RIGHT BEHIND.

              He immediately goes for another boat.

              ANGLE ON ROWBOAT
 
              Unfortunately, this one is older and more rickety, evident
              when Tommy steps into it and it SQUEAKS and MOANS.
 
              TIGHT ON SACK
 
              Opening it up, Tommy pulls out a long and very heavy chain.
              He then withdraws some huge padlocks.
 
              ANGLE ON TOMMY
 
              With intense urgency, he looks along the lake shore for
              something.

              Suddenly, they stop, turn, and retrace their steps.
 
              ANGLE THROUGH TREES - ON JASON
 
              Seems he has lost his prey.  Carefully, he searches the
              RUSTLING bushes for the hiding sheriff.
 
              TIGHT ON SHERIFF'S SWEATING FACE
 
              Buried deep in the thick bushes, the winded sheriff holds his
              breath as Jason passes.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

              Megan has done her best to assure the children that they are
              safe.  She stands up.
 
                                  MEGAN
                        Now I gotta find my daddy, the
                        sheriff, so we can all go home.
                        Okay?
 
              The kids nod.
 
              MEGAN
 
              heads for the door.  She turns to them.

                                  MEGAN
                        So you stay here and we'll be back
                        to get you.  Everyone lie back
                        down and don't worry.
 
              ANGLE ON TWO BOYS
 
              The 12-year-old youngsters seen earlier.  Billy turns to his
              sarcastic friend Tyen.
 
                                  BILLY
                               (scared)
                        What do you think?
 
                                  TYEN
                        I think we're dead meat.

              Tommy struggles to roll a large, heavy rock toward the boat.
              In the background, Megan is running around the campsite
              CALLING OUT for her father.
 
              ANGLE ON TOMMY
 
              Already fearing the worst, he yells to Megan:
 
                                  TOMMY
                        Megan!  Use your dad's car radio
                        and call for assistance...and an
                        ambulance!

              ANGLE ON MEGAN
 
              She stares at Tommy, petrified at what that means.  She then
              runs toward the sheriff's car.
 
              ANGLE ON CAR DOOR
 
              As Megan throws the car door open, SISSY'S HEAD ROLLS OUT AND
              LANDS AT HER FEET.
 
              LOW ANGLE - UP AT MEGAN
 
              She goes berserk with horror.

                               (screaming)
                        Oh, God!  Oh my God!

              Megan looks around, terrified that this same fate has
              befallen her father.  She SCREAMS OUT even LOUDER:
 
                                  MEGAN
                        Dad!  Answer me!  Daddy, where are
                        you!  Help us!

              CLOSE ON SHERIFF
 
              He looks up, HEARING his daughter's distant CRY.  What can he
              do?
 
              ANGLE ON JASON
 
              He stops his search.  He HEARS Megan as well.  JASON HEADS IN
              THE DIRECTION OF MEGAN'S VOICE.
 
              WIDER
 
              The sheriff peeks out of his hiding place.  Our killer storms
              by without seeing him.  Jason is hell-bent for Megan.
 
              CLOSER ON SHERIFF
 
              Seeing Jason heading towards his daughter, his protective
              fatherly instincts cause him to take action without thought.
              He leaps out at Jason!
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        No!  Not her!
 
              JASON IS TACKLED FROM BEHIND
 
              With almost superhuman strength, the sheriff attacks Jason
              and starts pounding him into the ground.

              TIGHT ON JASON AND SHERIFF
 
              So aggressive and relentless is the pummeling, for a moment
              you think he might kill the monster.  But only for a moment...
 
              CLOSE ON JASON
 
              Only disoriented and not at all hurt, Jason rolls over under
              the sheriff.  He grasps the sheriff's arm, stopping the
              assault.
 
              ANGLE DOWN - ON THEM
 
              JASON SHOCKINGLY TEARS THE SHERIFF'S ARMS OUT OF THEIR
              SOCKETS.  He throws them aside.
 
              LOW ANGLE UP - ON THEM
 
              JASON GRIPS THE SHRIEKING LAWMAN'S HEAD.  HE PUSHES IT BACK,
              CAUSING THE SHERIFF'S BODY TO BEND ALL THE WAY BACKWARDS.
 
              TIGHT ON SHERIFF'S CONTORTED FACE
 
              As he is forced back toward his feet, a horrid CRACK is
              HEARD.  HIS SPINE HAS BEEN SNAPPED IN HALF.  His body
              collapses backwards.
 
              WIDER
 
              Enraged, Jason throws the rag doll-like body of the sheriff
              aside as he rises.  Megan's VOICE is HEARD again, calling for
              the father.  JASON HEADS FOR HER.

                        You gotta help me look for
                        him...We need him to help us.
 
              ANGLE ON BOAT
 
              The chains are arranged to go around the rock.  Tommy tries
              to brace himself as they lower the boulder down.  A CRACK is
              HEARD as the huge stone lands in the old wooden boat.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (exhausted)

              She grabs the locks and gives them to him angrily.

                        You're gonna be sorry.
 
              TOMMY
 
              starts padlocking the chains tightly around the rock.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        I hope not.

              fashions a noose.
 
              MEGAN
 
              paces the dock in nervous fear.  She doesn't know what to do.

              Tommy unties the boat and pushes off the dock into the

                                  TOMMY
                        Megan!  Get back into the cabin
                        with the kids.

                        Megan, please!
 
              Suddenly it dawns on her that he's actually leaving her alone
              out here.  She panics.
 
                                  MEGAN

              OFF ITS HINGES.
 
              THE CHILDREN
 
              run SCREAMING to the back of the cabin.

              MOVING SHOT - OVER MEGAN'S SHOULDER
 
              She races from the landing toward the cabin.

              Tommy watches, helpless.  He stands up.

              Megan is only a few yards from the cabin.  WITHOUT WARNING,
              JASON BURSTS OUT THROUGH A WINDOW AND LANDS BEFORE HER.

              ANGLE ON JASON AND MEGAN
 
              He springs up and grabs the stunned Megan.
 
              TIGHT ON MEGAN'S FACE
 
              As she SCREAMS, Jason's hand grips her face.  She is about to
              share the same horrific fate as Officer Pappas.
 
                                  TOMMY (O.S.)

              Out on the lake, Tommy is seen awkwardly standing in the
              boat, waving his arms.
 
                                  TOMMY
                        Come on, Jason!  It's me you want!
                        Come and get me!
 
              BACK TO JASON
 
              He suddenly tosses Megan aside and heads for Tommy.
 
              MEGAN
 
              falls on the ground, trembling and hyperventilating.  She
              stares at the departing Jason and looks back at the cabin.

              All the eyes of the petrified kids peek down at her from the

              Tommy keeps taunting Jason to come for him.

                        That's it!  Come on, pus-head!
 
              EXT. LAKE SHORE - NIGHT
 
              Jason reaches the lake and keeps going as if the water didn't
              even exist.  He stays fixed on the one thing he's wanted to
              kill the most...Tommy.

              EXT. ON LAKE - IN BOAT - NIGHT
 
              Seeing he's got him, Tommy sits down.  He reaches for the
              chain noose and holds it in his sweating hands.
 
              EXT. LAKE SHORE - NIGHT
 
              Jason is wading deeper into the dark, choppy waters.
 
              EXT. CAMP FOREST GREEN - NIGHT
 
              Seeing Jason is getting dangerously close to Tommy, Megan
              jumps up and starts yelling:
 
                                  MEGAN
                        Tommy, get out of there!  Row to
                        the other side of the lake!
                        Hurry!!
 
              EXT. LAKE - NIGHT
 
              Jason stops and turns back to look at Megan.  Should he get
              her first?
 
              ANGLE ON TOMMY IN BOAT
 
              He panics and yells at Jason:

                        Hey, asshole!  It's me you want,
                        remember?!  Come on, chickhenshit,
                        I'm sittin' here waitin'!
 
              JASON
 
              turns back towards the boy.  He moves on him like a hungry
              shark.
 
              ANGLE ON CHAIN NOOSE
 
              Tommy's nervous hands keep the noose out of Jason's sight as
              he opens it wider.
 
              TIGHT ON JASON'S MASKED FACE
 
              He is almost to the boat.
 
              TIGHT ON TOMMY'S FACE
 
              He is sweating profusely as he grits his teeth.
 
              TIGHT ON NOOSE
 
              It's ready.

              JUST AS JASON REACHES THE BOAT, HE SUBMERGES, DISAPPEARING
              INTO THE DARK WATERS.
 
              ANGLE DOWN - ON TOMMY IN BOAT
 
              The boy goes crazy, looking from one side to the other.
 
              CLOSER ON TOMMY
 
              He scans the sinister, churning waters.  Where will Jason re-
              emerge?
 
              BACK ON ANGLE ABOVE TOMMY AND BOAT
 
              A long, tense wait.
 
              ANGLE OFF SIDE OF BOAT
 
              Bubbles rise.  Tommy holds the noose over him.  JASON
              EXPLODES UP FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE ON BOAT
 
              Tommy loses his balance and drops the noose into the bottom
              of the boat.  His fall causes the rickety boat to CRACK.
 
              INSERT - ON HULL
 
              Water starts to leak in around the huge rock.
 
              JASON
 
              grabs for Tommy, who struggles to reach the noose.
 
              EXT. CAMP FOREST GREEN - NIGHT
 
              Megan is freaking out, not knowing what to do.
 
              EXT. LAKE - NIGHT
 
              JASON'S HAND GRABS TOMMY'S JACKET.  The boy fights to break
              free of his grip.
 
              INSERT - ON HULL
 
              Their struggle causes it to split open wide.  More water
              pours in.
 
              ANGLE ON TOMMY'S FOOT
 
              He tries to snag the noose as Jason pulls harder on him.

              TOMMY
 
              yanks his arm away violently, causing his sleeve to rip off
              in Jason's hand.
 
              ANGLE ON TOMMY'S FOOT
 
              He manages to catch to noose with his shoe.
 
              INSERT - ON HULL
 
              The boat is filling up with water around the rock.
 
              JASON
 
              grabs ahold of Tommy's leg.
 
              TOMMY'S OTHER FOOT
 
              slides the chain up to his outstretched fingers.
 
              ANGLE ON TOMMY AND JASON
 
              The boy grabs the noose and forces it over Jason's head.
 
              TIGHT ON JASON
 
              Enraged, he lunges at Tommy!
 
              ANGLE ON BOAT
 
              That's all that's needed to split open the hull!  JASON IS
              PULLED UNDER AND HE DRAGS TOMMY DOWN WITH HIM.
 
              EXT. CAMP FOREST GREEN - NIGHT
 
              MEGAN SCREAMS HYSTERICALLY.
 
              INT. UNDERWATER
 
              The large boulder falls to the bottom of the lake.  Its chain
              pulls taut.
 
              CLOSE ON JASON
 
              The chain noose tightens around Jason's neck.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE
 
              Jason struggles to hold on to Tommy while trying to loosen
              the choke-chain.

              TIGHT ON TOMMY
 
              He fights to free himself of Jason's grasp before running out
              of breath.
 
              ANGLE ON JASON
 
              He gives up on the noose, opting to strange Tommy instead.
              Both are drowning in this battle.
 
              EXT. LAKE - NIGHT
 
              Bubbles appear on the surface of the lake.  After a flurry of
              them, they cease.
 
              EXT. CAMP FOREST GREEN - NIGHT
 
              MEGAN COVERS HER MOUTH IN DREAD.
 
              EXT. LAKE - NIGHT
 
              After a moment, Tommy's limp body rises to the surface.  It
              floats, lifeless.
 
              INT. UNDERWATER
 
              Jason's body also hangs lifeless, anchored vertically by the
              chain...The two have destroyed each other.
 
              EXT. CAMP FOREST GREEN - NIGHT
 
              Knowing it's over, all the kids slowly exit the cabin.  They
              surround the catatonic Megan.  The wind has DIED DOWN.
 
              LITTLE NANCY
 
              stares up sorrowfully at Megan.
 
                                  NANCY
                               (softly)
                        Is he kill-ded?
 
              MEGAN
 
              breaks out of her shock.  She heads for the lake.
 
                                  MEGAN
                               (to kids)
                        Stay here.
 
              REVERSE ANGLE TOWARD LAKE
 
              Megan races to the lake and dives in.

              EXT. LAKE - NIGHT
 
              Megan swims toward the motionless Tommy.
 
              ANGLE DOWN - ON MEGAN AND TOMMY
 
              She reaches her man, holds him around the chest, and pulls
              him to shore.
 
              INT. UNDERWATER
 
              MEGAN'S LEG IS GRABBED BY JASON.  He tries to pull her down.
 
              EXT. LAKE - NIGHT
 
              Megan fights for her life as she repeatedly gets yanked down.
 
              INT. UNDERWATER
 
              Megan's feet kick at her attacker.  But Jason's iron grip
              will not let go of her leg.
 
              TIGHT ON JASON'S HEAD AND NECK
 
              ONE OF MEGAN'S POWERFUL KICKS DRIVES INTO JASON'S THROAT.  A
              stream of final air bubbles and disgusting, ugly black fluid
              rushes from his mask!
 
              JASON'S HAND
 
              lets go of Megan's leg.  She swims away.
 
              FINAL SHOT OF JASON
 
              Our infamous killer is at last defeated.  His rotting corpse
              hangs in its original underwater burial ground.
 
              EXT. LAKE SHORE - NIGHT
 
              Megan pulls Tommy's body onto the shore.
 
              THE CHILDREN
 
              run down and surround them with concerned faces.
 
              ANGLE ON MEGAN AND TOMMY
 
              She frantically gives him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
 
              TIGHT ON TOMMY
 
              He doesn't respond.

              MEGAN
 
              won't accept that he's dead.  She fights back the tears as
              she pushes on his abdomen.
 
              TIGHT ON TOMMY
 
              Still nothing.
 
              ANGLE ON NANCY
 
              She watches Megan trying desperately to revive the lifeless
              boy.  The child gets an idea.  She closes her eyes and
              whispers a little prayer.
 
              RESUME MEGAN AND TOMMY
 
              The tears are now flowing down Megan's cheeks.  She knows her
              efforts are in vain.  In frustration, she strikes his chest
              hard.
 
              TIGHT ON TOMMY
 
              He coughs and spits out water.
 
              ANGLE ON MEGAN
 
              She WHOOPS and helps him to sit up.  A few of the kids CHEER.
 
              LITTLE NANCY
 
              opens her eyes and is quite surprised it worked.  She looks
              heavenward and smiles a "thank you."
 
              CLOSE ON TOMMY
 
              As Megan hugs him gratefully, Tommy looks out over the
              moonlit lake.
 
                                  TOMMY
                               (sighs; relieved)
                        It's over, Megan.  It's finally
                        over.  Jason is home.
 
              WIDE ON SCENE - BEHIND GROUP
 
              We look over the shoulders of Tommy, Megan and the kids as
              they stare at the now-peaceful lake.
 
                                                       FADE OUT:
 
              FADE IN:

              EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
 
              SUBJECTIVE MOVING CAMERA
 
              Slowly we HEAD between the tombstones, stalking the old
              caretaker, Martin.  He is bent over, pulling weeds.  We COME
              CLOSER and CLOSER, then finally stand towering over him.  He
              senses us and turns around, STARTLED.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE ON MARTIN
 
              He climbs nervously to his feet, quickly dropping the weeds.
 
                                  MARTIN
                               (overly friendly)
                        You.. .ha-ha.. frightened me.  I
                        was just, you know, cleaning up
                        the...place, you know.  Ha-ha.
 
              OVER THE SHOULDER OF STRANGER - ON MARTIN
 
              All we see is a dark suit and longish red-gray hair.  The way
              Martin looks up at him, we know he is hiding true terror of
              this mysterious stranger.
 
                                  MARTIN
                        Er.. nice to see you again, Mr.
                        Voorhees...Haven't seen you in
                        Crystal...er, Forest Green, in
                        quite some time.
 
              There is only a deathly silence from the nefarious man.
 
                                  MARTIN
                               (nervously)
                        Hey, I've been takin' real good
                        care of your wife and son's
                        graves.  Go look. You'll be real
                        pleased.
 
              Martin forces a grin to cover his fear.
 
              ANGLE ON MR. VOORHEES' HAND
 
              It reaches into his back pants pocket and withdraws a small
              wad of money.  The gnarled hand gives it to Martin.
 
              MARTIN obsequiously accepts his payment.  He practically
              genuflects before him.
 
                                  MARTIN
                        Thank you, Mr. Voorhees. Thank
                        you.  I'll leave you in private,
                        like you like.  Okay, er...bye. 
                        Thank you.
 
              He takes his earning and dashes away...probably to the liquor
              store.
 
              ANGLE ON LAWN
 
              Mr. Voorhees' black shoes head toward us and stop.  Slowly,
              we TILT UP toward his face.  Just as we reach his chest...
 
              ANGLE OVER HIS SHOULDER - ON TWO GRAVES
 
              We recognize them from before.
 
              CLOSER ON GRAVES
 
              Of course, they are his wife's and son Jason's.
 
              WIDER ANGLE - FROM BEHIND HIM
 
              He stands menacingly over his family's resting place...Does
              he sense something is wrong here?
 
              EXTREME CLOSEUP OF HIS EYES
 
              They stare down at his son's grave.   These eyes are truly
              evil.  Cold.  Dark.  Demonic.  Then the worst happens... They
              slowly look up at us.  They seem to accuse us of knowing the
              true whereabouts of his son.  AND HE WON'T STOP GLARING AT US.
 
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
 
              EXT. LAKE FOREST GREEN - DAY
 
              We GLIDE tranquilly over the blue water toward the middle of
              the lake.
 
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
 
              SLOWLY MOVING IN on the water, it seems we are about to
              descend into it... JASON EMERGES AT US!  We PULL BACK a bit.
              No, it's only his infamous MASK.  Freed from it's wicked
              owner, it floats peacefully along old CRYSTAL LAKE... for now.

              FADE IN:
 
 
         1    EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - DUSK
 
              We're rapidly moving across the water, skimming, towards the
              dark woods on the far shore.
 
 
         2    EXT. BACK ROAD/INT. TOYOTA CELICA - DUSK
 
              ELIZABETH MARCUS drives her Toyota Celica along this heavily
              wooded road.  She's a young woman, innocent looking, sweet
              and pretty.
 
              The light is fading.  Shadows begin to overtake the land.
 
              She is obviously some place remote.  A sign caught briefly
              in her headlights says, "CRYSTAL LAKE - 4 MILES".  Elizabeth
              swings the car around a barely seen curve in the road.  She
              pulls up...
 
 
         3    EXT. DESERTED CABIN - DUSK
 
              Elizabeth parks the Toyota.  She gets out, takes a look at
              the cabin.
 
              A "FOR RENT" sign hangs, tacked to the porch at an angle.
              The place looks dark, dirty, uninviting.
 
              She moves to her rear door, opens it and bends in to get her
              over-night bag.  Behind her, the darkness gapes with the
              ominous threat of violence.
 
              She comes back out of the car and moves to the cabin.  A
              porch swing, rotted and unusable, BANGS METHODICALLY against
              the old wood of the house.  Elizabeth fumbles for the keys
              and drops them.
 
              As she bends down to pick off, the "FOR RENT" sign snaps it
              chain and swings down, missing her neck by inches.
 
              Startled, she rips the sign off and tosses it onto the porch
              with a LOUD BANG.
 
 
         4    INT. DESERTED CABIN - LIVING ROOM - DUSK
 
              Elizabeth enters.  The place is damp and dank.  A layer of
              moldy dust has gathered.  Shadows obscure the corners of the
              room.
 
              Elizabeth put down her bag and gropes the wall for a switch.
              She finds one.  Flips it.  The light turns on for a few brief
              moments...then sputters and goes out.

                                  ELIZABETH
                        Shit...
 
              She turns and goes back outside.
 
 
         5    EXT. DESERTED CABIN - DUSK
 
              Elizabeth walks slowly around the cabin, towards a decrepit
              old woodshed at the edge of a dark, unfriendly woods.  She
              slowly opens the door...a mossy ladder rests against the far
              wall.
 
              Elizabeth enters and walks towards the ladder.  Suddenly, the
              woodshed door BANGS CLOSED.  Elizabeth SHRIEKS then,
              scrabbling at the door, flings it open and rushes outside
              with the ladder.
 
              There is a RUSTLE off among the trees.  She hesitates again.
              Footsteps on dry leaves?  Just a gust of wind off the lake?
 
              With a last look over her shoulder, she drags the ladder back
              towards the cabin and enters.
 
 
         6    INT. DESERTED CABIN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
 
              Elizabeth comes back in with the ladder.  She picks up her
              bag, removes a four pack of bulbs and, climbing on the
              ladder, replaces the bulb in the living room.  The light
              comes on...but it's scant illumination against the dark night.
 
              Suddenly, her foot slips on the slimy step of the ladder and
              she drops the old bulb, which SHATTERS LOUDLY on the floor.
 
              Grimacing, Elizabeth climbs down the ladder and quickly
              sweeps up the broken glass.  Having done that, she shuts the
              front door all the way, then puts her bag on the bed and
              opens it.  She takes out a few pairs of jeans and some shirts
              and moves to the standing wardrobe.
 
              We know that she will open the doors of that wardrobe and
              come face to face with her death.
 
              She opens the wardrobe.
 
              Nothing...just a moth.
 
              She puts her clothes away.  The sound of a branch SCRAPING
              against the side of the cabin adds to the tension.  Now she
              turns...
 
              ...there is no one waiting there in the doorway.

              Elizabeth yawns, stretches and walks up the stairwell to the
              second floor landing, which leads into a pitch black hallway.
 
 
         7    INT. DESERTED CABIN - BATHROOM - NIGHT
 
              She moves down the hallway, then enters the bathroom and
              turns on the light.  Crossing to the bathtub, she bends down
              and turns on the hot water.  It comes spitting out, brackish
              and brown at first, then finally clear.
 
              She stays, bent over the tub, letting the dirty water run
              down the drain.  Then she puts the plug in, filling the tub
              for a bath.  As it fills, she undresses down to the her
              T-shirt and underwear.
 
              She looks over to discover that the medicine cabinet door is
              open.  She crosses to it and closes it.
 
              This has got to be the one.  She will close that door and
              there, reflected in the mirror will be...
 
              ...nothing, just the dim illumination of the bathroom light.
 
              She bends down to test the temperature of the tub water.
              It's good.
 
              She removes her underwear and t-shirt, then puts one foot in
              the water, testing it, then eases into the comforting warmth.
 
              The light in the bathroom sputters and then burns out.
 
              Elizabeth SIGHS, resigned, then continues climbing into the
              tub when -- WHAM!
 
 
         8    INT. DESERTED CABIN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
 
              The front door blows open, banging into the wall.
 
 
         9    INT. DESERTED CABIN - BATHROOM - NIGHT
 
              Elizabeth turns, startled.  She grabs her towel (brushing by
              her makeup bag) and, wrapping the towel around her, walks
              slowly down the dark hallway onto the landing.
 
              From downstairs, she HEARS A NOISE.
 
 
        10    INT. CABIN - NIGHT
 
              Bending precariously far out over the landing, she looks down
              onto the first floor.

              HER POV
 
              Nothing but the stirring of leaves, blowing into the cabin
              through the open doorway.
 
              ON ELIZABETH
 
              as a cool breeze from the doorway makes her shiver.  Slowly,
              she moves towards the stairs when we HEAR THAT SOUND AGAIN
              from downstairs.  What the hell is it?  Once again she leans
              far out over the landing.
 
              HER POV
 
              Still nothing.  Leaves.  The WHINE OF THE WIND.
 
              ON ELIZABETH
 
              looking -- something must have made that noise.  Then,
              suddenly, from the perfect darkness behind her, JASON
              VOORHEES steps out, hockey mask in place, machete sharp and
              ready.
 
              Elizabeth stands back up, OBSCURING JASON FROM VIEW.
 
              CLOSE ON ELIZABETH
 
              feeling that something is definitely not right...in fact,
              something is really, really wrong.  With a panicked
              expression, she turns around to look behind her.
 
              HER POV
 
              Nothing.  Darkness.  Jason is gone.
 
              ON ELIZABETH
 
              Relaxing -- everything's okay.  She turns towards the stairs
              and right into Jason, who raises his machete high.
 
              With a SCREAM, she leaps backwards as Jason swings, flying
              through the rotted wood of the railing and crashing down onto
              the first floor.
 
              ON JASON
 
              yanking his machete from the wooden bolster on the railing.
 
              ON ELIZABETH
 
              looking down at her towel.  It's sliced through -- a thin
              line of blood crossing her stomach in a diagonal.  She runs.

        11    EXT. DESERTED CABIN - NIGHT
 
              Elizabeth leaps from the porch, over an overrun flowerbed,
              onto the hood of her car.  She quickly looks behind her.
 
              HER POV
 
              to see Jason striding through the front door of the the
              cabin, coming for her.
 
              ON ELIZABETH
 
              as she skids all the way across the hood of the car onto the
              far side, then runs through the trees and brush in front of
              the house -- her feet bare, her eyes panicked.  The branches
              seem to claw at her, tearing, scratching...
 
              JASON'S POV
 
              quickly gaining.  God, he moves fast!  Elizabeth turns, sees
              us and SCREAMS.
 
              ON ELIZABETH
 
              turning back to face forward when -- WHACK!  She's clipped by
              a tree and knocked to the ground.  She scrambles up and looks
              around.
 
              HER POV
 
              Jason is nowhere to be seen.
 
              Elizabeth moves slowly now, turning around, her breathing
              quick and panicked.  Where is he?!  Is he toying with her?!
              She turns and Jason leaps in front of her, machete raised.
 
              Suddenly, Elizabeth reaches into the cleavage at the front of
              her towel and pulls out a small pistol.
 
                                  ELIZABETH
                        Eat me, you bastard!
 
              She fires one shot directly into Jason's forehead, knocking
              him back at step, then turns and bolts towards --
 
 
        12    EXT. CLEARING IN WOODS - NIGHT
 
              She runs into this clearing then turns to see Jason rapidly
              coming after her, striding out into the open, raising his
              machete ready to deliver the lethal blow when, suddenly,
 
              INTENSE BRIGHT LIGHTS SNAP ON AROUND THE CLEARING

              stunning Jason for a moment.  The girl disappears into the
              treeline as
 
              THE DEAFENING ROAR OF GUNFIRE
 
              cracks out from the darkness.  There are FBI AGENTS hidden
              behind every tree, bush and rock...and now, they are all
              firing on Jason at once.
 
              Jason jerks as the bullets tear into his body.
 
              Then there is a moment...the FBI agents watching...waiting
              for Jason to fall.
 
              But he doesn't fall.  He stands there.  His head turning
              slowly, searching the darkness for his next kill.  Suddenly,
              from out of the darkness we hear:
 
                                  FBI AGENT ABERNATHY
                        Incoming!
 
              We hear a muffled SHOOMP! sound, then a familiar WHISTLING as
              a mortar shell descends on Jason in the middle of the
              clearing.
 
              The grenade lands right at Jason's feet.
 
              An anxious beat...then...
 
              THE MORTAR EXPLODES!
 
              We watch as Jason is blown, irrevocably, limb from limb.
 
              ON VARIOUS CHUNKS OF JASON
 
              spinning slowly in the air in SLO-MO.  An arm, something
              unrecognizable, his head still in the hockey mask, then,
              finally
 
              ON JASON'S BLACK HEART
 
              spinning through the air to finally land, with a WET PLOP, on
              the field.  It beats once, then once more...then stops.
 
              A moment of silence...then the rest of the FBI agents emerge
              from their hiding places.  There is an eerie after-the-battle
              silence to the scene.  Jason's crimes have been so heinous
              that even in death, proximity to his mangled remains seems to
              render a somber atmosphere.
 
              AGENT ABERNATHY makes his way through his quiet, somehow
              stunned men, and over to Elizabeth.  He is clearly the man in
              charge -- his suit alone says that and his demeanor backs it up.

              Elizabeth stands and faces him.  It is a strange tableau...the
              bright lights, the smoke in the air, the nearly naked woman
              facing the man in the suit.
 
              Agent Abernathy offers his hand.
 
                                  ABERNATHY
                        Good job, Agent Marcus.
 
                                  ELIZABETH
                               (shaking his hand)
                        Thank you, sir.
 
              A T.V. Camera is thrust into Abernathy's face.  The MEDIA has
              apparently caught wind of this event.  REPORTERS scream for
              "Agent Abernathy...your comments..."  "What was your first
              thought when..."  Abernathy smiles and puts on his best
              "media" face.
 
                                  ABERNATHY
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, please...
                        please...
 
              The CROWD QUIETS.
 
                                  ABERNATHY
                               (continuing)
                        It is my pleasure to announce that
                        Jason Voorhees is finally and
                        irrevocably...dead.
 
              ANGLE ON A LONE MAN
 
              sitting some distance away on the rise of a hill.  His
              weathered face shows a healthy contempt for this somewhat
              premature celebration.  He plugs a twisty, homegrown cigar
              into the corner of his mouth, light a match off the beard
              stubble on his chin, then fires up the cigar -- a glowing
              coal in the darkness.  His hawk's eyes stare at something
              with ferocious intent...
 
              ON JASON'S HEART
 
              Laying on the ground in the clearing, not beating...but
              intact.
 
                                                       MATCH CUT TO:
 
 
        13    INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MORGUE - NIGHT
 
              Where we see the heart on a rolling metal surgical table.

              PULL BACK TO REVEAL
 
              A CORONER, a big man in his 30's, as he rolls the cart up to
              a security checkpoint manned by TWO FBI AGENTS.  The coroner
              hands his I.D. to FBI AGENT 1, then lifts his arms as FBI
              AGENT 2 pats him down.
 
                                  FBI AGENT 1
                        Okay, sir.
 
              The two sliding doors in front of the coroner slide open and
              he wheels the metal surgical cart inside, the door closing
              behind him.
 
 
        14    INT. FBI MORGUE - DAY
 
              The Coroner is in the middle of his autopsy.  He talks into
              a microphone as he works, taking the dismembered parts of
              Jason from a body bag.
 
                                  CORONER
                        We have a large male caucasian...age
                        unknown...
 
              He begins inspecting various organs, weighs them, takes
              samples.  He works methodically, making verbal notes as he
              works.
 
                                  CORONER
                               (continuing)
                        No indication of cirrhosis.
 
              ON JASON'S VILE, BLACK HEART
 
              as the coroner inspects it.
 
                                  CORONER
                        The heart is nearly twice the size of
                        a normal heart.  Malformed...
 
              He's about to lift the heart when...the heart beats!
 
              The coroner stops.  He didn't see that.
 
                                  CORONER
                               (trying to keep his
                                composure)
                        It appears to be filled with a black,
                        viscous fluid...frankly, I don't know
                        what the hell it is.  It's not blood.
 
              The heart beats again!

              The coroner stares, shocked, transfixed.
 
              The heart undulates now as it beats...it is a hypnotic,
              throbbing pulse.  Something that has to be stared at.
              Something that awakens deep, impossible cravings.
 
              It draws the coroner towards it, his eyes glassy, transfixed
              by what he sees.
 
              It beats faster, undulating, a gaping, kneading maw...
 
              The coroner stares, then reaches down and takes the now
              furiously beating heart in his hands.
 
              He looks at it for a frighteningly long beat.  He brings it
              closer to his face.  He would appear to be studying it...
              trying to understand what in God's name this thing is...
 
              And then he suddenly smiles, raises the monstrous organ to
              his lips...
 
              ...and eats the heart of Jason Voorhees!
 
              When he finishes the heart, he stands for a moment, not
              moving.  Then, suddenly, his throat bulges and he begins to
              SCREAM A HORRIBLE SCREAM and, as he SCREAMS we
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        15    INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MORGUE - NIGHT
 
              Dead silence.  Whatever is going on in that room cannot be
              heard through the airtight doors.
 
              The CORONER'S ASSISTANT walks up, carrying dinner.  The two
              FBI MEN stop him.
 
                                  FBI MAN 1
                        I.D.
 
                                  ASSISTANT
                        You just saw me come out of there.
 
                                  FBI MAN 1
                        I.D. please.
 
              Annoyed, fumbling, the assistant takes out his I.D.
 
 
        16    INT.  FBI MORGUE - NIGHT
 
              The assistant walks in to see the Coroner doubled over.

                                  ASSISTANT
                        Hey, what's the matter.
 
              The Coroner straightens, then turns to the assistant.  His
              mouth is smeared with black liquid of the heart.
 
                                  ASSISTANT
                               (continuing)
                        You ate already?  I was only gone ten
                        minutes.
 
              The assistant tosses the food on the counter as the Coroner
              takes
 
              A SHARP DISSECTING PROBE
 
              from off the table and walks over to him.
 
              The Coroner holds the dissecting probe up to the Assistant's
              face.
 
                                  ASSISTANT
                               (continuing)
                        Yes.  That's a probe.
 
              Suddenly, using his other hand, the Coroner
 
              SHOVES HIS INDEX FINGER
 
              up through the soft flesh under the Assistant's jaw hooking
              his finger through the Assistant's mouth and jerking the
              assistant's head down to
 
              SMASH INTO THE METAL EXAMINING TABLE
 
              Then, the Coroner takes the dissecting probe and drives it
              into the back of the Assistant's skull.  The Assistant
              spasms...then goes still.
 
              The Coroner turns and walks to the door, passing by a mirror.
 
              ON THE MIRROR
 
              to see the reflection.  It is not the coroner walking
              by...it's
 
              JASON VOORHEES, HOCKEY MASK IN PLACE!
 
 
        17    INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MORGUE - NIGHT
 
              The Coroner/Jason strides out of the doors and walks past the
              FBI men.

                                  FBI MAN 1
                        So that's the verdict -- is Jason
                        gonna be getting up and walking
                        around any time soon?
 
              The Coroner/Jason stops and slowly turns back to the two
              smiling FBI men -- there will be doom here very soon.
 
              Over this we hear:

              Photos of the two FBI men from the morgue, dead and bloody,

                        the aftermath of the autopsy of Jason
                        Voorhees, mere hours after his death
                        at the hands of Federal Forces.  The
                        facts:  Two security men -- dead.  A
                        Coroner -- dead.  Another Coroner --
                        missing.  Are these men victims  of
                        a serial killer only believed to be
                        deceased?  Many say yes.

        19    INT. TV STUDIO - DAY
 
              ROBERT CAMPBELL.  In his early 30's, he's got T.V. good
              looks.  He speaks in the overly serious "journalese" of
              tabloid television.

                                  CAMPBELL
                        I'm Robert Campbell.  Tonight, on
                        American Casefile, we'll talk, via
                        satellite, to Mr. Creighton Duke --
                        the bounty hunter responsible for the
                        capture of six of this country's most
                        reviled serial killers/
 
              SHOT WIDENS
 
              to include Duke, playing idly with a small dagger.
 
              We recognize him as the man who we saw watching Jason die.
              It's difficult to say how old he is -- it's his life that has
              weathered him, not his years.
 
                                  CAMPBELL
                        Mr. Duke, how can you claim that
                        Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
 
                                  DUKE
                        How many times has Jason been
                        reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
 
                                  CAMPBELL
                        Eight times.
 
                                  DUKE
                        Eight times.  They've burned him,
                        dipped him in nuclear waste --
 
                                  CAMPBELL
                        -- But this time they bombed him and
                        then cremated the body.
 
                                  DUKE
                        They coulda danced a jig on it an'
                        fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya'
                        can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of
                        his body.  He'll come back the way he
                        always do, to drag the kiddies into
                        the darkness and crush their little
                        skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr.
                        Campbell.
 
              Campbell laughs and smiles winningly.
 
                                  CAMPBELL
                        Well, let's hope not!
 
                                  DUKE
                        Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
 
              A look between the two of them.

                                  CAMPBELL
                        In the media, you've frequently been
                        described as "salty" --
 
                                  DUKE
                        -- look, just shut up.  Let's cut
                        through the shit.  You asked me here
                        because you want me to catch and kill
                        Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it,
                        but it won't be easy...and it won't
                        be cheap.  One hundred grand, non-
                        negotiable.
 
                                  CAMPBELL
                        I understand.  However, our audience
                        should be aware that you only charged
                        forty thousand dollars to catch the
                        Idaho skin stretcher.
 
                                  DUKE
                        Skin stretcher was human.
 
              Campbell takes a moment to make sure that isn't lost on his
              audience.  Duke leans in close.
 
                                  DUKE
                               (continuing)
                        Let's get one thing straight, Mr.
                        Campbell.  This isn't your garden
                        variety serial killer -- there's only
                        one way to put and end ta' put an'
                        end to Jason Voorhees for all time
                        and I'm the only one that knows the
                        way.  If you want him dead truly
                        dead -- my fee is one hundred grand.
                        You know where to find me.
 
              Duke stands.
 
                                  CAMPBELL
                        Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to
                        offer you your sum of one hundred
                        thousand dollars, payable only after
                        you provide American Casefile with
                        incontrovertible proof of --
 
                                  DUKE
                        -- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have
                        your hundred grand ready.  For that
                        you get the machete...the mask...the
                        whole damn thing.

        20    INT. DINER STOCKROOM - DAY
 
              The TV suddenly SNAPS OFF.
 
              REVERSE ANGLE
 
              to see DIANA KIMBLE, leaning back after having just shut it
              off. Sexy, in her early 40's, Diana is a waitress here in
              "Joey B's Diner".  Many people might be disturbed by the
              notion that Jason Voorhees is still alive, but for
              Diana...this means something much more.
 
                                  JOEY B. (O.S.)
                        Hey!  Lady Di!
 
              Diana whirls around to see JOEY B. -- the frightening, no-
              bullshit owner of the diner.  She's a big woman with a big
              attitude.
 
                                  JOEY B.
                        I'm sorry to cut into your TV time,
                        but there's a few customers out here
                        who'd like to eat sometime this
                        fuckin' month.
 
 
        21    INT. JOEY B'S DINER - DAY
 
              "Joey B's Diner" may not be the last place in the world you'd
              want to eat, but it's at least the second to last.  A couple
              of hockey masks hang from the ceiling and a banner proclaiming
              "JASON IS DEAD -- 2 FOR 1 BURGER SALE!" hangs on the far wall.
 
              Diana walks out and looks at this with an amused dismay.
 
                                  DIANA
                        This is truly sick.
 
                                  VICKI
                        Tell me about it.
 
              That comes from VICKI, the other waitress in the diner.
              Early 20's, she's cute and she's tough.  She moves off as
              Joey B. steps up.
 
                                  JOEY B.
                        No, this is not sick, Diana, this is
                        business.  People are gonna come to
                        see Jason's hometown and they're
                        gonna come with appetites.
 
              SHELBY, Joey B.'s husband and cook, leans out the serving
              window.

                                  SHELBY
                        Di -- food's up!
 
                                  DIANA
                        Thanks, Shelby.
 
              Besides him, WARD, Shelby and Joey B.'s early 20's son,
              sticks his head out as well.
 
                                  WARD
                        Ma -- you seriously want me to cut
                        these like this?
 
              He holds up a hamburger patty cut into the shape of a hockey
              mask -- oval with punched out eyeholes.
 
                                  JOEY B.
                        Yes I do!
 
                                  WARD
                        They look stupid...
 
                                  JOEY B.
                        Well, that's your dumbass fault --
                        they're supposed to look like hockey
                        masks!  Now watch.
 
              Joey B. quickly cuts a fresh hamburger patty into the
              appropriate shape, then balls up the cut-away meat and holds
              it up in front of Ward.
 
                                  JOEY B.
                        This makes a whole new patty...hence
                        the 2 for 1 burger sale.
 
                                  SHELBY
                        My God, I love this woman.
 
              They kiss.
 
                                  WARD
                        You guys make me sick.
 
              They break apart.  Shelby turns to Diana.
 
                                  SHELBY
                        Table 3, Di.
 
              We follow Diana as she picks up several plates and walks
              towards a table, passing by STEVEN FREEMAN who sits at the
              counter next to his friend RANDY -- a young cop in uniform.

              Steven, early 20's and good-looking, turns to Diana -- what's
              he's about to say is difficult for him but he tries to make
              it seem casual.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Diana -- you heard from Jessica
                        lately?
 
                                  DIANA
                        Yes.
 
              She sets a plate down in front of him and continues walking.
              Randy turns to Steven with a wry smile.
 
                                  RANDY
                        Allright, you're gettin' somewhere...
 
              We follow Diana to the table where JOSH (40's) and SHERIFF
              LANDIS sit.  Diana gives everyone their food as Randy walks
              over and sits down with them.
 
                                  DIANA
                               (to Josh)
                        Burger, side of fries.
                               (to Randy)
                        Double burger, side of rings.
                               (to Sheriff)
                        Meatloaf, side of me.
 
              And she leans forward and plants a kiss on his lips.  Josh
              smiles.
 
                                  JOSH
                        Where the hell was that on the menu?
                        I'd have ordered a couple.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (mock threat)
                        You keep movin' in on my woman and I
                        might have to take you out back and
                        shoot you.
 
                                  JOSH
                        Yeah, I've seen you shoot...
 
              They all smile.  It's a nice moment, until:
 
                                  RANDY
                        I don't know...
                               (baiting him)
                        ...I think you two should just go
                        ahead and get married.
 
              The Sheriff turns to him.

                                  SHERIFF
                        I'm sorry, son, I'm going' a little
                        deaf in my old age...what did you say
                        again?
 
              He stares at Randy fixedly.
 
                                  RANDY
                        I said I think I'll just eat my food
                        over by Steven and shut the hell up.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (to Josh)
                        That's exactly what I thought he said.
 
              Randy smiles and walks over to Steven as the Sheriff turns to
              Diana and affectionately rubs her back.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Everything going okay?
 
                                  DIANA
                        It's going.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Legs giving you trouble?
 
                                  DIANA
                        Not so bad, today.
 
              The Sheriff watches Randy sit back beside Steven.  Steven
              glances over, catches the Sheriff's eye, then quickly turns
              away.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Steven buggin' you?
 
                                  DIANA
                        Do you have to ask?
 
                                  JOSH
                        Jesus, he's relentless.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Let me talk to him, Diana.  I just
                        need three minutes with him.
 
                                  DIANA
                               (warningly)
                        Ed...

                                  SHERIFF
                        Okay.
                               (a beat)
                        So how is Jessica?  You talked to her
                        lately?
 
                                  DIANA
                        Yeah, she's good, considering. That
                        kid just takes everything in stride.
 
                                  JOSH
                               (mumbling into food)
                        Wonder where she got that from...
 
              Diana smiles at him.
 
                                  DIANA
                        I gotta get back to work.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Okay, I'll call you later.
 
              She gives him a quick kiss, then walks off. Josh watches her
              go, then fixes the Sheriff with a knowing stare.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Don't say it...
 
              Josh grins.  He starts HUMMING THE WEDDING BELL MARCH.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (continuing)
                        How about this -- I'll make you a
                        deal...I'll marry Diana when you quit
                        banging Edna and concentrate on your
                        wife.
 
                                  JOSH
                               (shakes his head)
                        Poor, lonely Diana...
 
              ON DIANA
 
              as she arrives at another table.  The customer's face is
              hidden by a menu.
 
                                  DIANA
                        What can I get ya'?
 
                                  MAN
                        I'll take a Voorhees burger and a
                        side of Jason Fingers.

              The man lowers the menu.  It's Duke.  He smiles.  Diana,
              recognizing him, takes a step back.  She recovers quickly.
 
                                  DIANA
                        Anything else?
 
                                  DUKE
                        Yes.
 
              Duke extends his hand.
 
                                  DUKE
                               (continuing)
                        Creighton Duke.
 
              Hesitantly, Diana shakes his hand.
 
                                  DIANA
                        I know who you are.
 
                                  DUKE
                        I need to talk to you.
 
                                  DIANA
                        I'm kind of busy right now...
 
                                  DUKE
                        I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees --
                        and I need you to help me.
 
                                  DIANA
                        Jason Voorhees is dead.
 
                                  DUKE
                        You know he's not...and he's coming
                        for you.
 
                                  DIANA
                        You food'll be right out.
 
              She turns to go.
 
                                  DUKE
                        I'll give you ten thousand dollars.
 
              That stops her.  She turns back.
 
                                  DIANA
                        No, I --
 
                                  DUKE
                        Twenty.

                                  DIANA
                        Look --
 
                                  DUKE
                        Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone
                        has a price, what's yours?
 
                                  DIANA
                        Look, I don't want your money!
 
                                  DUKE
                        Then maybe I should offer it to your
                        daughter...
 
              Diana does not, at any level, like Jessica being brought into
              the conversation.  She leans in close.
 
                                  DIANA
                        What do you want?
 
                                  DUKE
                        You know what I want.  You know why
                        I need you.
 
                                  DIANA
                        You need to leave.
 
                                  DUKE
                        I know everything about you, Diana.
 
                                  DIANA
                        That's it, we're done.
 
              She turns to go.
 
                                  DUKE
                        I know who you really are!
 
              This stops her in her tracks.  Suddenly, we hear:
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        What's the problem here?
 
                                  DIANA
                        N...nothing.
 
                                  DUKE
                        I was just making your girlfriend
                        there a little proposition...she's
                        thinking it over.  Right, luv?
 
              The Sheriff steps forward.

                                  SHERIFF
                        Maybe you should be moving on.
 
                                  DUKE
                        Maybe you should mind your own
                        business.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Get up!
 
                                  DUKE
                        Why don't you blow me, Chief.
                               (a beat)
                        After your girlfriend gets through.
 
              The Sheriff thinks a second -- then, suddenly, he swings at
              Duke.
 
              With surprising speed, Duke's hand darts up, catching the
              Sheriff's fist.  But, with equally surprising speed, Landis
              brings his gun up under the man's chin.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        You're talking about my lady.
 
                                  DUKE
                        She's your lady only cause she ain't
                        had a taste of the Duke yet.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Goddamnit!
 
              He grabs Duke, pulling him up from the table.
 
                                  DUKE
                        Careful, Chief.  I don't think you
                        know who I am.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        I know who you are and the last thing
                        we need around here is some freak
                        show "bounty hunter" making trouble.
                        I want you outta town and I want you
                        outta town now!
 
                                  DUKE
                        That's very colorful, chief.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (to Randy)
                        Take him to my car.  I'll be out in
                        a minute.

                                  RANDY
                        Let's go.
 
                                  DUKE
                        He's comin' for you, Diana...and your
                        daughter.  Lock your doors.
 
              Randy takes Duke away.  The Sheriff turns to Diana, a little
              proud, a little manly.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        I'm sorry if he upset you...
 
              Diana angrily turns to him.
 
                                  DIANA
                        I don't need you to fight my battle.
                        I don't need any part-time protection.
 
              Saying that, she walks off.  The Sheriff glances around at
              the people in the diner then, a little cowed, goes outside.
 
              ON DIANA
 
              as she walks up to the counter where Steven sits.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        He seem to think Jason's...
                               (in Duke's accent)
                        ...comin' fer ya'?
 
              He smiles.  She doesn't.  Vicki walks up.
 
                                  VICKI
                        You okay?
 
              Diana nods.
 
                                  VICKI
                               (continuing)
                        Okay.
 
              Vicki moves off.  When she does, Diana turns to Steven.
 
                                  DIANA
                        Steven, I need to talk to you.
                        There's something you don't know
                        about Jessica, something you should
                        know.  She was going to tell you
                        herself but...
 
              Diana looks up and stares out the window.

              HER POV
 
              One of Joey B's hockey mask spins slowly in her field of
              vision, but instead of looking cheesy...it now seems
              scary...foreboding.  Diana turns back to Steven.
 
                                  DIANA
                        ...but there just may not be enough
                        time.  If you still care about her,
                        if you still want to try to make
                        things better between you two...we
                        should talk.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        So let's talk.
 
                                  DIANA
                        No.  Not here.  Come by my house
                        tonight at eleven.  Don't be late.
 
              As Steven looks at her worried face, we
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        22    EXT. JOEY B'S DINER - NIGHT
 
              Diana comes out the back door of the diner, taking the
              garbage out.
 
              POV SHOT
 
              slowly moving in on her, stalking.  There shadows, the dark
              gaps of night and woods between her and the trash...we just
              know that she is going to die.
 
              ON THE DUMPSTER
 
              as Diana approaches it.  She flings it open with a LOUD BANG
              then dumps the trash in.  We stay close...sure she is going
              into that dumpster with her trash...
 
              But no...she finishes and turns...
 
              ...Right into Josh!
 
                                  DIANA
                        Jesus!
 
                                  JOSH
                        Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my
                        car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...

                                  DIANA
                        It's...It's all right.
 
              Josh takes the trash can from her...carries it back towards
              the diner.
 
                                  JOSH
                        Listen...don't you worry about Ed.
                        He'll come around.  He's too good a
                        Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
 
                                  DIANA
                        I'm just too old for going steady,
                        Josh.
 
                                  JOSH
                        So's he and he knows it.
 
              They've reached the diner.  He opens the door for her.
 
                                  JOSH
                               (continuing)
                        Everything'll work out.  Trust me on
                        that.
 
                                  DIANA
                        Okay.
 
                                  JOSH
                        Good night, beautiful.
 
                                  DIANA
                        'Night, Josh.
 
              She gives him a quick hug, then closes the diner door, going
              back inside to clean up.
 
              Josh steps off the porch and around back to the parking lot.
 
              STALKER'S POV
 
              following him, moving in, closer...
 
              IN THE PARKING LOT
 
              EDNA steps out of her car as Josh approaches.  She's an
              attractive woman around Josh's age.  He smiles and moves to
              kiss her.  She stops him.
 
                                  EDNA
                        Not here.
 
              She looks around nervously.

                                  EDNA
                               (continuing)
                        Sorry I'm late.
 
                                  JOSH
                        Bill didn't go bowling at the regular
                        time?
 
                                  EDNA
                        The League changed the damn
                        time...but we've still got 'til ten-
                        thirty.  Hop in.
 
              Josh smiles and hurries to the passenger side of the car as
              Edna climbs back in behind the wheel.
 
              STALKER'S POV
 
              Suddenly rushing towards the car, smashing into the driver's
              door, slamming it shut with tremendous force just as Edna's
              head is lowered to enter.
 
              She is dead.
 
              STALKER'S POV
 
              Turns to Josh who stands frozen in absolute terror.
 
              POV RUSHES AT HIM
 
              as we --
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              BLACK, then slowly
 
              FADE UP ON:
 
 
        23    INT. VOORHEES HOUSE - ROOM - NIGHT
 
              CLOSE ON JOSH
 
              Strapped on a metal table.  Straps across his body.  Even a
              strap to hold his head firmly in place.  FIRELIGHT dances
              across his apparently nude body and his terror-stricken eyes.
              His terror grows as a shadow leans in to cover his face.
 
              ON THE CORONER/JOSH
 
              As he looks down at Josh.  It is the coroner we see, but his
              eyes are those black empty pools of Jason's evil.  Many large
              sores cover the man's face.

              Even as we watch, another seems to push its way forth from
              the skin.  Clearly, they weaken the man.  He sways slightly.
              Catches his balance... and raises something into view.  A
              STRANGER RAZOR.
 
              ON JOSH
 
              As he begins to whimper.  The man lowers the razor towards
              his face.  The blade glints in the firelight as the
              Coroner/Jason brings it down, closer... closer... until its
              sharp edge touches Josh's skin.  Then, suddenly,
 
              The man begins to give Josh a shave!
 
              The SCRAPE of the razor is loud against Josh's unlathered
              moustache.
 
              Now the cornoner/Jason moves the blade across Josh's Adam's
              apple... carefully, expertly.
 
              When the man is finished, there is a long, uncertain beat,
              then his hands bring a hot towel into view.
 
              JOSH'S POV
 
              As the towel is laid over his face.
 
              BLACKNESS
 
              Over which we hear the STRANGLED SOUNDS of the Coroner/Jason
              breathing -- what the hell is he doing?  After a long moment,
              the towel is lifted and, still in
 
              JOSH'S POV
 
              We see the coroner/Jason lean in, opening his mouth wide,
              until his face fills the screen.
 
              A beat, then Josh SCREAMS a horrible SCREAM as we
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        24    EXT. VOORHEES HOUSE - NIGHT
 
              There is a dark and evil aura to the house, but it is not the
              Victorian haunted house of some storybook tale of ghosts.  This
              a place built as a summer home in the forties... abandoned many
              years ago... it looks now as if it is dissolving slowly back
              into the small, encroaching corner of the lake behind it and
              into the woods around it.
 
              But the sense of evil doesn't come from the rot or the
              decay... those are just symptoms.

              The sense of evil comes from the core of darkness that we can
              feel in every gaping window.  In every shadow.  In the dark
              shadows of the trees and the darker waters of the lake.
 
              As Josh continues to SCREAM, we
 
                                                       FADE TO BLACK:
 
 
        25    INT. DINER - NIGHT
 
              Steven and Randy sit by the counter, Vicki stands beside them
              and we can see Ward back in the kitchen, cooking up some food.
 
                                  STEVEN
                               (to Vicki)
                        What do you mean you've never made a
                        prank call?
 
                                  VICKI
                        Never.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        You mean never as in really never, or
                        never as in it was just so stupid you
                        don't want to tell us about it?
 
                                  VICKI
                        I mean really never.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        I'm sorry to hear that.  A famous man
                        once said -- there is no worse regret
                        then a temptation resisted.
 
              A beat.
 
                                  RANDY
                        Jesus, Steven, that's...that's really
                        lovely.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        I mean, how can you go through life
                        without never having made a prank
                        call?
 
                                  RANDY
                        Hell, when Steven was a kid, he was
                        like, having strippers delivered to
                        church Bingos and shit.
 
                                  VICKI
                        That's disgusting.

                                  STEVEN
                        Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out
                        for six months after that!  They
                        raised enough money to build a day
                        care center.
 
                                  RANDY
                        It was a community service.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Absolutely.  The church even sent me
                        an autographed picture of God.
                               (yelling to the back)
                        Ward!
 
                                  WARD
                               (shouting from back)
                        Yeah!
 
                                  STEVEN
                        You ever make a prank call?
 
                                  WARD
                        I called an adoption agency once when
                        I was like nine or something and I
                        told them I wanted to trade my mom in
                        for a box of Lincoln Logs.
 
              Suddenly, a wet sponge comes flying in from offscreen and
              hits Ward in the face.
 
                                  JOEY B. (O.S.)
                        Why don't you shut the fuck up and
                        cook those burgers?!
 
                                  WARD
                        I really wanted those fuckin' Logs.
 
              ON STEVEN
 
              As he gets up and walks over to the pay phone in the diner.
 
                                  RANDY
                        What are you doing?
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Showing Vicki what she missed out on
                        by being such a dull kid.  Now, the
                        first thing you need in making a
                        prank call is, of course, a phone.
                               (holds up the phone)
                        This one, for instance.

                                  RANDY
                        Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Next, you dial a number.
 
                                  VICKI
                        Really, Steven, I don't want you to
                        do this...
 
              Steven dials a number.
 
              CLOSE ON
 
              The receiver to see Steven click it off out of view of the
              others.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        ...and it's now ringing...ringing...
                        and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria?
                        Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker
                        over at the station.
 
                                  RANDY
                        Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just
                        have one question for you, Anthony --
                        did you fuck my dog?
 
                                  RANDY
                        Oh my God, Steven.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if
                        I find out it was you, I'm gonna come
                        over there and shoot you in the head.
 
                                  RANDY
                        I'm now begging you.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Listen, since I got you on the
                        phone -- ask the guys there if they
                        wanna chip in for a hooker.  I'll
                        send her right over.  Her name is
                        Vicki.
 
                                  VICKI
                        Steven!

                                  STEVEN
                        She's a waitress at Joey B's but she
                        needs some extra cash.  Ward's the
                        pimp.
 
                                  VICKI
                        I'm literally going to kill you!
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to
                        you -- you can have her for a pizza.
 
                                  VICKI
                        A pizza?!
 
              Suddenly, Randy walks up to Steven and quickly handcuffs him
              to the metal phone cord.
 
                                  STEVEN
                               (to Randy)
                        Randy, what the fuck?  Take these off!
 
              Wards sets two paper bags down on the counter.
 
                                  WARD
                               (to Randy)
                        Food's ready.  Tell the guys at the
                        station the pimp says hi.
 
                                  RANDY
                               (taking food)
                        Sure thing.  See ya', Steven.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Randy, you dipshit!  Take these off!
 
                                  RANDY
                        Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I
                        have a job...
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Randy, c'mon!
 
                                  RANDY
                        Have a good night.
 
              The Steven glances at the clock -- 11:10.  He was supposed to
              meet Diana ten minutes ago.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Ah, shit.
 
              With startling speed, Steven pops off the cuff on his wrist,
              hangs up, then turns to Randy waving his free wrist.

                                  STEVEN
                        Wanna know how I did that?
 
                                  RANDY
                        Yeah...
 
                                  STEVEN
                               (Steven smiles)
                        Gotta go.  See you guys later.
 
              He runs past Randy to the door of the diner, then stops and
              turns to him.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        By the way, if you'd been paying
                        attention you'd have noticed I held
                        the receiver down when I dialed --
                        cop like you should be more observant
                        than that.
 
              And he rushes out of the diner.
 
                                  RANDY
                        He drives me so fucking crazy.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        26    INT. DIANA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
 
              In the darkness, the phone RINGS.  A key turns in the door as
              Diana enters.  She finds the light switch as the phone RINGS
              again.
 
              The lights come on and she dashes across the room to answer
              the phone.
 
                                  DIANA
                        Coming!  Hold on!
 
              She snatches the phone.
 
                                  DIANA
                        Hello...
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (from the phone)
                        June the 19th.
 
              Diana thinks a second trying to place the caller...then
              suddenly smiles.
 
                                  DIANA
                        Ed...

              Behind Diana, a shadowy figure appears in the doorway.  We
              see him as he moves forward, but Diana doesn't.
 
 
        27    INT. LANDIS' SQUAD CAR - NIGHT
 
              He's in his car, talking on the phone.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        That's when my vacation starts.  If
                        we get married then, we'll have two
                        weeks in Hawaii.
                               (a beat)
                        I love you, Diana.  I'm sorry I've
                        waited this long.  Let's do it.
 
 
        28    INT. DIANA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
 
              Diana is as happy as she's ever been.  The man (who we now
              recognize as Josh) is still approaching from the shadows.
 
                                  DIANA
                        God, Ed, I love you too, I...
 
              Now directly behind Diana, Josh snakes a hand out, snatches
              the receiver from her then slams it back into its cradle.
 
              Diana only ha time for a STARTLED GASP as Josh grabs her.  He
              takes her head in a firm embrace and draws her face close to
              his.
 
                                  DIANA
                        Josh!  What are you doing!
 
              His lips draw closer and closer to hers.  His eyes are cold,
              empty places.
 
              She turns her head to the side, away from Josh.  Her eyes
              open in a terror born of absolute disbelief and a certain
              knowledge that, except for the pain, she is already dead.
 
              DIANA'S POV
 
              On the mirror over the mantle.  In the reflection she sees
              not Josh, but Jason Voorhees, mask in place.
 
                                  DIANA
                        Oh God...Oh Jesus...

              ON JOSH/JASON
 
              As he reaches out to Diana, turns her head back to his and
              opens his mouth -- it's dank and vile and there's something
              in there, something that writhes horribly, the same oozing
              color as Jason's dark heart.
 
              As the thing squirms out from between his teeth and towards
              Diana's lips, she manages to screams last:
 
                                  DIANA
                        No!
 
              Panicked, determined, she reaches down and opens the drawer
              of the phone table.
 
              Inside is a service revolver.
 
              The phone begins to RING AGAIN as Diana grabs the gun and
              sticks it against Josh's temple as the black thing in his
              mouth begins to pry her lips apart, trying to worm inside.
 
              She pulls the trigger.
 
              The SHOT RINGS LOUD in the room.  Josh/Jason staggers back,
              falls to his knees. He's been shot in the back of the head at
              close range -- it's a wound that would kill anyone human.
 
              The phone CONTINUES TO RING, until it is knocked off it's
              cradle by Diana as she turns and runs to the patio door.
 
              It's locked.
 
              She fiddles with it, trying to open it, then glances back to
              make sure Josh/Jason isn't coming for her.
 
              Josh/Jason isn't there.
 
              Oh, shit.  She back against a wall, looking around -- where
              is he?  She turns.  He's not there.  She spots the phone and
              moves towards it.
 
              Then, from the darkness of the shadows...
 
              ...Josh/Jason leaps out at her, grabs her and flings her down
              to the floor.
 
              The injured, but very obviously alive Josh/Jason holds
              Diana's head firmly against the carpet.  He lowers his mouth
              towards hers and, once again, that black thing in his mouth
              squirms through his lips.  The phone keeps RINGING and
              RINGING...

              Suddenly, the room is bathed in light as a car pulls up
              outside.
 
 
        29    INT. DIANA'S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT
 
              Steven enters.  He sees blood and, hearing Diana SCREAM,
              rushes into
 
 
        30    INT. DIANA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
 
              and leaps on Josh, his momentum knocking the man off Diana
              before Josh can force the horrible, squirming thing from his
              mouth into hers -- but the advantage is just momentary.
 
              Josh/Jason turns to Steven and grabs him by his shirt,
              picking him up off the ground with what is clearly superhuman
              strength and throws him against the nearest wall.
 
              Steven hits the wall with a sharp, nearly back-breaking
              impact.  He lies for a moment, stunned, near unconsciousness,
              then he regains his bearings just in time to see Josh/Jason
              taking a knife sharpening pole from the knife rack next to
              him in the kitchen.
 
              Then Josh/Jason turns and flings the instrument through the
              air at Steven just as Diana runs up to see if Steven's okay.
 
              The pole pierces Diana through the back.
 
              She looks up at Steven with a stunned expression and then
              sinks down to the floor revealing Josh/Jason behind her.
 
              There is a fury in him now that is terrible to behold.  An
              unearthly SCREAM of frustration and rage tears from his
              throat.  His hands reach out, ready to tear into Steven.
 
              Steven manages to duck, roll and come up beside the fireplace.
 
              Josh/Jason turns and charges at Steven.
 
              Steven grabs a fireplace poker and rams it with all of his
              strength through Josh/Jason's chest.
 
              As he does this, he is positioned so that he can't help but
              see the reflection in the mirror.  He sees Jason Voorhees
              struggling furiously... trying to pull the poker out of his
              chest.  In trying to do that, Josh/Jason is thrown backward.
 
              He crashes through a window and falls outside.
 
              Steven rushes back to Diana.  He bends, taking her in his
              arms.

                                  DIANA
                               (weakly)
                        You saw him?  You know who he is?
 
              Steven nods.
 
                                  DIANA
                               (continuing)
                        You have to...save...Jessica... Save
                        Jessica and save the...
 
                                  STEVEN
                        The what?
 
                                  DIANA
                        Save your...
 
              But the pain is too much.
 
                                  DIANA
                               (continuing)
                        Steven...
 
                                  STEVEN
                        I'm here.
 
                                  DIANA
                        I'm scared.  I'm very scared.
 
              All Steven can do is hold her.  Her eyes close.  She dies.
 
                                  SHERIFF (O.S.)
                        Oh, God Almighty, no...
 
              ON SHERIFF
 
              Standing there, staring, in shock.  He pulls his gun.
 
              As he does this, Steven sets Diana down and runs towards the
              window.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        It was Josh.  He fell outside.  He --
 
              Steven looks out the window.
 
              STEVEN'S POV
 
              There is nothing there but darkness.  Josh/Jason is gone.
 
              ON STEVEN
 
              As he turns back to SHERIFF. The man kneels by Diana.

                                  SHERIFF
                        Oh, my dear God...
 
                                  STEVEN
                               (really to himself)
                        He was dead.  He had to be dead...
 
              SHERIFF looks up at Steven.
 
              The boy stands covered in blood.  Suddenly, he realizes what
              this must look like.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        No... you can't think I...
 
              But SHERIFF's eyes grow cold.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Let's go.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        31    INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
 
              Steven is in this dismal interrogation room.  He's tired,
              frightened, angry.  We don't know how long he's been here,
              but it's clearly been a long time.  SHERIFF and Steven's
              friend, Randy, are in the room with him.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        How many times do you want to hear
                        this?
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Until I hear the truth.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        I've told you the truth.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        The truth?  That Josh, a man I've
                        trusted with my own life on more than
                        one occasion -- let me see if I've
                        got the order right here -- tried to
                        rape Diana...got the back of his head
                        blown off...took a poker through the
                        gut...fell through a plate glass
                        window and then magically disappeared
                        into the night.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        I know what it sounds like.

                                  SHERIFF
                        You don't know shit!
 
                                  STEVEN
                        I didn't kill her!
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Then why were you at her house?!  She
                        didn't want anything to do with you.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        She asked me to come over.  She said
                        she had something to tell me.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        About what?
 
                                  STEVEN
                        About Jessica.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        That's a lie.  Diana would never talk
                        to you about Jessica.  Not after what
                        you did to her.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Look, I know I treated her bad --
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        -- Bad?!
 
              SHERIFF suddenly hauls off, WHACKS STEVEN ACROSS THE FACE
              then grabs him by the collar and pulls him close.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (continuing)
                        You call what you did bad?!  You
                        knocked her up and then left her!
 
                                  STEVEN
                        No -- she left me!  After her
                        miscarriage, I --
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        -- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told
                        you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
 
                                  STEVEN
                        She did!
 
              SHERIFF looks at Steven with an almost astonished pity.

                                  SHERIFF
                        My God...you are one sorry son-of-a-
                        bitch.
 
                                  STEVEN
                               (a little frantic)
                        She did have a miscarriage, didn't
                        she?  Didn't she?!
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a-
                        bitch...
 
              Defeated, eyes filled with loss and anger, SHERIFF turns and
              walks away.  Then, just before he exits, he turns back.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (continuing)
                        If I wasn't the Sheriff here, if I
                        thought I could get away with it...
                        I would kill you right now.  That's
                        no exaggeration.
                               (to Randy)
                        I'll be back.
 
              The Sheriff leaves.
 
              Steven watches him go, then turns to Randy who can't quite
              bring himself to meet Steven's steady gaze.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Do you believe me?
 
              Randy has to think about this.  Finally:
 
                                  RANDY
                        I don't believe that you murdered
                        Diana.  I don't know what really
                        happened, but I know you couldn't
                        have done it.
 
              Steven nods -- that's going to have to be enough for now.
 
                                  RANDY
                               (continuing)
                        You just sit tight -- I'm gonna take
                        care of this.  I'll straighten
                        everything out.
 
              Steven SIGHS, then closes his eyes and rubs them.

                                  STEVEN
                        Jesus, Randy...
                               (looks up at Randy)
                        ...what is Jessica gonna do?
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        32    INT. DIANA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAWN
 
              Early morning light filters through the windows.  The door
              opens and JESSICA KIMBLE enters.  She's in her early twenties,
              a strikingly beautiful image of her mother.  There is a
              startled GASP.
 
              ON VICKI
 
              The young waitress who worked with Diana at the diner.  She's
              trying to clean the bloodstains off the floor and the
              furniture.
 
                                  VICKI
                        Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted
                        to have this cleaned up before you
                        got here.
 
                                  JESSICA
                        That's all right.  I was just...
 
              Jessica fights it, trying not to cry.
 
              Vicki gets up, wiping her hands on her overalls, and walks
              over to her friend and hugs her.
 
                                  JESSICA
                               (continuing)
                        Oh, God, Vick...
 
              They hold each other.  Suddenly, we hear a BABY CRYING.
              Startled, Vicki looks over Jessica's shoulder and sees a baby
              carriage, standing just outside the door.
 
              Vicki moves to the carriage and picks up the baby, who
              immediately STOPS CRYING.
 
                                  VICKI
                        A girl?
 
              Jessica nods.
 
                                  VICKI
                        She's beautiful.

                                  JESSICA
                        Her name's Stephanie.
 
                                  VICKI
                        She's yours?
 
              Jessica nods.  A beat.
 
                                  VICKI
                        She has Steven's eyes.
 
              She smiles from the baby to Jessica, looking for confirmation.
              Jessica gives a little, reluctant nod.
 
                                  VICKI
                        Why didn't you tell me?
 
                                  JESSICA
                        I was going to, I was going to tell
                        everyone.  I just...didn't expect to
                        be back here so soon.
                               (a beat)
                        Is Steven around?
 
              Vicki nods.
 
                                  JESSICA
                               (continuing)
                        Does he know about what happened?
 
                                  VICKI
                        Yeah.
                               (a beat)
                        Sit down a second.  There's something
                        I need to tell you about Steven...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        33    INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAWN
 
              Steven is sitting alone, waiting to discover his fate.
              Suddenly the door opens and Randy walks in.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Well?
 
                                  RANDY
                        I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a
                        cell.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Are you crazy?!

                                  RANDY
                        I know, I know, I'm sorry but the
                        Sheriff is just berserk right now.
                        C'mon.
 
 
        34    INT. MAIN ROOM OF POLICE STATION - DAWN
 
              Randy leads Steven from the interrogation room towards the
              jail cell block.
 
                                  RANDY
                        Hopefully we won't have to hold you
                        more than a day.  I'm gonna bust my
                        ass to prove you innocent but you
                        gotta be cool or Landis will really
                        kil you, okay?  Okay?
 
              Steven has not been paying attention -- he's staring at
              something on the other side of the room.
 
              HIS POV
 
              Jessica enters through the front door with Vicki.
 
              ON STEVEN
 
              In his eyes we see that, in spite of whatever might have
              happened in the past, he really loves this girl.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        ...Jessica...
 
              ON JESSICA
 
              As she suddenly turns and lifts something up into view -- the
              baby.
 
              ON STEVEN
 
              As his eyes widen, realizing what this means, what it was
              that Diana was going to tell him, what Landis meant by his
              talk about a "miscarriage".
 
              This is his daughter he's looking at.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        My God...
 
              Suddenly another man comes through the police station door
              and places his hands protectively on Jessica's shoulders.
              She turns away from Steven and looks at this new arrival.
 
              It's Robert Campbell, the host of "American Casefile".

              He and Steven each eye each other...instant enemies.
 
              Suddenly, Randy jerks Steven away towards the cell block.
 
                                  RANDY
                        C'mon.
 
 
        35    INT. JAIL CELL - DAY
 
              ON STEVEN
 
              As Randy SLAMS THE CELL DOOR in front of him, locking him in.
 
                                  RANDY
                        I'll be back later.  You just be
                        cool, okay.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Okay.
 
                                  RANDY
                        Don't do anything stupid.
 
                                  STEVEN
                        What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up
                        in a friggin' cell?!
 
                                  RANDY
                        I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just
                        hang tight.  Okay?
 
                                  STEVEN
                        Okay.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        36    INT. LANDIS' OFFICE - DAY
 
              The Sheriff is working at his desk when there's a KNOCK AT
              THE DOOR.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Yeah?
 
              The door opens and Jessica (carrying her baby), Vicki and
              Robert enter.  The Sheriff immediately jumps up and hugs
              Jessica tightly.  He says nothing -- there's nothing to say.
              Finally, when they break:
 
                                  JESSICA
                        Ed...I'd like you to meet my
                        boyfriend, Robert Campbell.

                                  LANDIS
                        Ed Landis.
 
              They shake hands.
 
                                  LANDIS
                        I've seen your show.  I like it about
                        as much as I like anything on the
                        television.
 
                                  CAMPBELL
                        Thank you.
 
                                  LANDIS
                        I hope you're not down here on
                        business.  I wouldn't take kindly to
                        seeing Diana's face on one of your
                        programs.
 
                                  CAMPBELL
                               (an arm around Jessica)
                        No, sir.  I'm just here for Jess...
 
              Landis nods, apparently satisfied.  He looks at Jessica's
              baby.
 
                                  LANDIS
                        He's a cute little fella.
 
                                  JESSICA
                        He's a she.
 
                                  LANDIS
                               (without missing a beat)
                        And as pretty as her mamma...and her
                        mamma before that...
 
              A sad beat of silence.  Suddenly, the INTERCOM BUZZES.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Yeah?
 
                                  OFFICER DILL (O.S.)
                               (over intercom)
                        Sheriff, we, uh, we have a problem
                        with Diana Kimble's body...
 
              The Sheriff immediately snatches up the phone so he can talk
              privately.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        What's the problem?

              There is a pause as the Sheriff listens and we can tell from
              his face that whatever the problem is...it's serious.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Bring him here.  I wanna talk to him.
 
              The Sheriff hangs up the phone.
 
                                  JESSICA
                        What's the matter?
 
              The Sheriff smiles disarmingly.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Ah, the funeral home just has a
                        couple questions.  Wait here, I'll be
                        back in a minute.
 
 
        37    INT. POLICE STATION HALLWAY - DAY
 
              The Sheriff storms down this hallway in a fury.  At the other
              end we see Creighton Duke, in cuffs, walking towards him with
              OFFICER DILL slightly behind, trying to keep up.
 
              Finally, the Sheriff and Duke get nose to nose.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
 
                                  DUKE
                        That's what I'd like to know.
 
                                  OFFICER DILL
                        We found him in the morgue.  The body
                        was missing and he was standing over
                        the open cabinet.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (to Duke)
                        What the hell were you doing there?!
 
                                  DUKE
                               (matter-of-factly)
                        Trying to steal the body, obviously...
                        but you fucked up and let someone get
                        to it before I could.
 
              The Sheriff can barely contain himself upon hearing this. He
              tries to calm down, but it's an effort.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Why did you want her body?

                                  DUKE
                        For a good reason.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Tell me.
 
                                  DUKE
                        Sorry.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Tell me!
 
                                  DUKE
                        Information like that is very
                        expensive and you don't have the
                        balls to pay the price.
 
              The Sheriff turns to Officer Dill.
 
                                  SHERIFF
                        Lock this asshole up.
 
                                  DUKE
                        You think you can lock me up in this
                        piss-ass prison?  Hell, this place is
                        motel fuckin' six to me.
 
                                  OFFICER DILL
                        Shut-up.
 
                                  DUKE
                               (to Sheriff)
                        You better find that body right away
                        you incompetant dickhead because if
                        it's where I think it is...you're
                        gonna be in world of shit.

                               (to Officer Dill)
                        Lock him the fuck up and after you
                        do, I want you to find that body --
                        do you understand me!  I don't care
                        what you have to do, I don't care
                        where you have to go, FIND IT!
 
 
        38    INT. LANDIS' OFFICE - DAY
 
              Landis enters with a pleasant smile on his face.
 
                                  JESSICA
                        What's going on?

                                  SHERIFF
                        Aw, nothing.  It's taken care of.
 
                                  ROBERT
                        Everything's okay, then?
 
                                  SHERIFF
                               (sharply)
                        Yes, everything's okay.
					FREDDY VS JASON
					
					A Screenplay by:
					  Peter Briggs

	FADE IN:

	EPIC MUSIC O.S., the MAIN TITLES ROLLING over a series of medieval 
	WOODCUTS.  SINISTER IMAGERY - monsters, demons, torture devices - 
	DISOLVING into one another, then we...

										    		    
	OPEN ON:

	EXT. HILLSIDE PASS - SUNSET (17TH CENTURY)

	Lush green fields and vineyards, very like the Napa Valley.  
	SOLEMN BENDICTINE CHANTING on the SOUNDTRACK, and the distant 
	RESONANT TOLLING of a church bell, O.S.

	We HEAR TINKLING CHIMES.  With a gentle CLIP-CLOP OF HOOVES, a 
	burro crests a dark hill, silhouetted against the blood-red sun.  
	Its rider adorned in lavish Catholic vesments.

	Before we can be amused, SIX MAGNIFICENT CHARGERS follow.  Two 
	grim-faced 	CIVILIANS in formal Middle-Ages clothing to the fore, 
	a vanguard of pennant-wielding SOLDIERS at back.

	CLOSER NOW.  The horses are nervous.  The burro's rider - SIGNOR 
	DELUCA - MURMURS something nervously in Italian.

						SIGNOR DELUCA
			"Le colline...hanno occhi!"

	PITT - a wary American Witchfinder - narrows his eyes.  Turns to 
	his traveling companion.

						PITT
			What did he say?

	HOPKINS - an aristocratic Englishman with a startling similarity 
	to Christopher Lee - avoids his gaze.  Scours the encroaching 
	terrain with his 	keen vision.

						HOPKINS
			"The hills...have eyes."

	The horses WHINNY, worried by something nearby.  SHEET-LIGHTNING 
	whites-out the sky, drizzle spattering the earth.

						SIGNOR DELUCA
					(heavily-accented English)
			It's begun --

	AN ANGLE ABOVE, LOOKING DOWN.  The company trek purposefully along 
	the winding trail.  Something dark prowls past IMMEDIATE 
	FOREGROUND. GROWLS inhumanely...

	EXT. CASTLE APPROACH - SUNSET (17TH CENTURY)

	The horses BUCK and REAR as they round the bend.

						SOLDIER #1
			Mother of God --

	THEIR P.O.V.  A PAIR OF GROTESQUE WOODEN-FRAME EFFIGIES dominate 
	the trail 	ahead, one to either side.  Human-shaped, 30 feet 
	tall.  Both are aflame, packed with BURNING CADAVERS (anyone 
	remember the 1973 movie "The Wicker Man"?).

						HOPKINS
					(solemnly)
			I've seen this before.

						PITT
			In England?

						HOPKINS
			In the darkest chasm of my dreams...

	As the troupe continue forward, we CRANE UP BEHIND THEM.  Half a 
	mile away, a gothic Italian castle looms ominously dark THUNDER 
	CLOUDS roll supernaturally across the sky.  A SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION 
	CARD informs us this is:

			ITALY - 1648

	EXT. ENTRANCE - CASTLE - NIGHT (17TH CENTURY)

	The ground has turned to slush.  The horses skid, lose their 
	footing.  An ornate wooden box tethered to a saddlebag bursts 
	open, releasing --

						PITT
			Pontiff -- !

	SOLDIER #1 dismounts, scrabbles in the mud.  Passes two rather 
	plain-looking daggers back to DeLuca.  As he does--

	THEY TRANSFORM.  Morphing into exact duplicates of the Byzantine 
	blade which slayed Jason Voorhees in "Jason Goes To Hell."  
	Astonishment flashes across the Soldier's face.

						SIGNOR DELUCA
					(admonishes him)
			This matter...will not pass your lips.

	Hopkins and Pitt stare covetously at the weapons.

						PITT
			The Daggers of Horvath...

						SIGNOR DELUCA
			Sacrosanct.  Said...forged...by the 
			alchemists...of dead Atlantis.

						HOPKINS
					(cannily)	
			...And also from the blade which pierced
			the side of Christ?

	DeLuca shrugs, perhaps a little annoyed.

						SIGNOR DELUCA
			The origins are unimportant.  Only their
			powers count this day.
					(to Soldier #2)
			Tether the animals.

	A turret rises above, a portent of doom.  Lightning FLARES.

	INT. ENTRANCE HALL - CASTLE - NIGHT (FOREGROUND MINATURE)

	Boots ECHO on stone as the group enter an expansive circular 
	chamber.  Water PLINK-PLONKS from dank archeways all around.  
	Inverted crosses on the walls, torches flickering in metal wall-
	holders.  A wide staircase spirals into cobwebbed darkness above.

	A pair of giant censers swing back-and-forth...dozens of dangling 
	chains with upturned corpses - real Grand Guignol - tangled in 
	them.

	The FAINT STRAINS of a NURSERY RHYME - somehow familiar to us - 
	intrude.  Incongruously, the LYRICS are Italian --

						DREAM CHILDREN
					(O.S., "Freddy Theme")
			"Uno, Due...Thanos venga per te.  Tre,
			quattro...dovete chiudre le porte."

						HOPKINS
			You hear -- ?

						SIGNOR DELUCA
			Si.  Pitt...?
	
	The American stares up at the hanging wrought-iron chandelier 
	frame, scrutinizing the SYMBOL forged into it.  Neither Celtic 
	run, nor Egyptian glyph.  Not Sanskrit, or pentangle...but somehow 
	all at once.

						PITT
			Salem.  Four years past.  I burnt a coven.
			This same device.
					(a beat)
			Evil is at hand...

						DREAM CHILDREN
					(O.S.)
			"Nove, dieci...non dormirai piu --"

	A VERTICAL ANGLE, HIGH ABOVE.  The RHYME stops.  SILENCE.  We HEAR 
	a STEADY THUMP...THUMP.  They draw their swords as --

	Something PUNCHES FORCEFULLY through a COBWEB VEIL, BOUNCES down 
	the steps.  Comes to a halt at SOLDIER #3's feet...a dyed-purple 
	leather ball.  He bends 	

						PITT
			Wait -- !

	Either the man chooses to ignore, or he doesn't understand.  He 
	picks it up.  There's a MIDIEVAL SMILING SUN embroidered in gold 
	filigree on one side.  He grins.  Flips it to see --

	BURNS and MELTS, maggots and yellow bile pouring forth into his 
	hand.  It multiplies exponentially, spilling up along his arm in a 
	second like a cancer.  He turns, SCREAMING to the others --

						HOPKINS
			Back...stay back!

	The Soldier lurches for them, his entire body consumed now.  He 
	stumbles, falls to the floor.  EXPLODING into a mass of scarab 
	beetles that scurry past their feet for the corners of the room.  
	DeLuca crosses himself.

	GIGGLING from above.  The group look up to see a pair of YOUNG 
	GIRLS in white dresses duck back over a high balcony.

						SIGNOR DELUCA
			There...

	INT. WINDING STAIRWAY - CASTLE - NIGHT (17TH CENTURY)

	A HUGE SPIDER scuttles across the thick blocking cobwebs.  The 
	group cautiously acend the stairway, slicing at the musty veil.  
	As Pitt turns his lantern to see a wall HEAVING with bugs --

	A COVEY OF CROWS flush from a cranny, wings fluttering into their 
	face, blinding them.  DeLuca staggers back, feet pedaling on the 
	edge.  A straight drop, 50 feet...

						HOPKINS
					(alarmed)
			Signor!

	Hopkins hand lashes out and drags him back.

						SIGNOR DELUCA
					(thankful)
			Grazie.

	INT. CORRIDOR - CASTLE - NIGHT (17TH CENTURY)

	At the corridor's end are massive iron doors, 5 feet tall.  A pair 
	of drop-dead gorgeous BLACK WOMEN in white robes stand before 
	them, staring enigmatically with peculiar eyes.  The smoke 
	wreathing them SWIRLS back through the doors like REVERSE TIME-
	LAPSE, gliding them with it.

	INT. NECROMANCER'S LAIR - CASTLE - NIGHT (17TH CENTURY)

	Another cylindrical chanber; the "Penticon" symbol Pitt recognized 
	hewn large on the ancient stone floor.  Through a glass skylight 
	above, turbulent clouds simmer menacingly.

						HOPKINS
			The Necromancer.

	In the chamber's center - above the "Penticon", about 5 feet off 
	the ground - floats a MAN. Crunched into a fetal position, he is 
	naked.  Tautly muscled, every square inch of his body inscribed 
	with occult symbology.  (He also bears more than a passing 
	resemblance to Robert Englund).

						SIGNOR DELUCA
			My nephew...

	THE DOORS SLAM CLOSED behind them, the wall-torches extinguishing.   
	The chamber becoming wreathed in the darkest shadows imaginable.  
	A WOMAN'S LAUGHTER ECHOES ICILY, O.S.

						PITT
			Time is short.

						SIGNOR DELUCA
			Let us hurry.

	The three men approach.  The air shimmers, as if they've just 
	passed through an invisible field of some kind.

	The three Soldiers stare around the room nervously.  All around 
	are drawings and models, prototypes of fantastic inventions.  
	They're so proccupied, they don't notice --

	THIER OWN SHADOWS, peeling away from their bodies and sliding up 
	the wall to vanish into the gloom above.

						SIGNOR DELUCA (cont'd)
			Help me.  Reveal his heart.

	DeLuca holds the Dagger steady.  As Hopkins and Pitt reach up to 
	grasp the Necromancer's folded arms --

	Behind them, DARK GRASPING CLAWS shoot down from above towards the 
	Soldiers.  Hauling a SCREAMING Soldier #1 upward.

	The Necromancer's eyes SNAP OPEN instantly, unleashing a BELLOW OF 
	RAGE.  DeLuca slams forward with astonishing strength, driving the 
	Dagger into the Necromancer's chest..but only part way.  The 
	creature's arms WHIP OUT with superhuman force, knocking the 
	demon-slayers away.

	Soldiers #2 and #4 hack furiously away with their swords, trying 
	to release their comrade, as --

	Hopkins reaches out. Grasps the Dagger's handle and drives it 
	further into the Necromancer's heart, twisting it.  He SHRIEKS 
	like a feral animal --

	Then falls to the floor.  That same instant, the disemboweled 
	corpse falls. Soldier #1 drops out of the shadows with a THUMP.  
	The survivors edge warily forward, until --

	THEIR LANTERNS FLARE LIKE XENON, achingly bright.  The shadown in 
	the room seem to alter...flow.  A moving, liquid mass from every 
	corner that pours towards the fallen Necromancer, entering the 
	corpse's mouth and nostrils.  The chamber brightens, until --

	There are no more shadows in the room.  A BEAT, then --

	THE BODY EXPLODES, atomized to fine red droplets.  An ENORMOUS 
	FORM rises up from within, some vast CLOAKED OUTLINE, LAUGHING 
	with DEEP MALEVOLENCE.  Pitt steps forward, brandishing a 
	crucifix.

						DARK VOICE
			Foolish mortals...do not task me!

						PITT
			Be gone, Apollyon!

	A shadow tentacle lashes out, slithers around Pitt's neck.  Hauls 
	him off the floor and squeezes tight.  The crucifix clatters to 
	the ground as blood seeps from his lips.

	Hopkins and SOLDIER #4 race forward to help.  Another pair of 
	tentacles explode forth.  Hopkins is sent sprawling...the black 
	mass PUNCHING straight through the Soldier #4's armor like a 
	javelin and impaling him against the wall.  An arrow unleashed 
	from Soldier #2's crossbow evaporates in mid-air.

	Pitt's tentacle finishes its work.  His decapitated body drops to 
	the ground, the head rolling off into the shadows.

	Another pseudopod hurtles for DeLuca, who cries out --

	But suddenly Hopkins is there, wielding a Dagger of Horvath.  The 
	tentacle hits the Holy blade and rives into black ice, showering 
	the chamber floor.  The Shape LAUGHS UPROARIOUSLY.

						DARK VOICE
			When Time...reaches its close...and your
			race attains the skies...I will set my 
			creatures to shatter this world.

						SIGNOR DELUCA
			Consign thee to Hell, foul spawn!

	The stone "Penticon" beneath the Necromancer's corpse SHATTERS 
	like glass, dropping into a GAPING ESOPHAGAL TUNNEL that plunges 
	into the DEPTHS OF HELL.  The Shadow-form disappears in a 
	SHOCKWAVE BLAST that EXPLODES the skylight and SPLINTERS 
	everything breakable.  The MOCKING LAUGHTER fades as the 
	"Penticon" reseals whole.

						HOPKINS
					(dryly)
			Demons.  So overdramatic.

	DeLuca gazes around at the complex inventions, marvelling.  

						SIGNOR DELUCA
			Look at this.  The detail...the genius.

						HOPKINS
			Humankind...might profit immeasurably.

	Soldier #4 approaches Hopkins hesitantly.

						SOLDIER #2
			Sire?  What...should --?

	Hopkins moves something on a nearby drafting board.  Examines the 
	soft vellum parchment stretched out there.

	Like a Da Vinci anatomical study, we see an intricately detailed 
	orthographic representation of FREDDY KRUEGER'S KNIFE-GLOVE 
	and JASON VOORHEES' KILLING MASK.

						HOPKINS
					(absent, but authoritative)
			Burn it all.  Raze it to the ground.

	Flames CRACKLE up INTO FRAME all around as we TRACK SLOWLY into 
	the blueprint.  SLAMMING ROCK MUSIC RISES O.S. as we --

						    		    DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

	EXT. ELM STREET. - BETHLEHEM, VIRGINIA - DAY

	BRIGHT SUNLIGHT, filtering down through the boughs of trees.  We 
	CRANE DOWN, past a sign reading "Elm Street."  Hit a van in 
	FOREGROUND on a read of anonymous suburban storefronts.

	TWO CAPTIONS FADE-UP.  The FIRST, which READS:
		
			BETHLEHEM, WEST VIRGINIA.

	And then is replaced by the SECOND:

			DECEMBER, 1999.

	An innocuous-looking bookshop sits across the road, the sign above 
	the door reading "SAMHAIN BOOKS."  Right out-front, a muscular 
	HELL'S ANGEL sits astride a gleaming Harley.  A scantily-clad 
	BIKER BABE faces him atop the gas-tank, legs wrapped around his 
	waist.  They're sucking some serious face.

						REZNOR
					(O.S.)
			What - are you grafted to him, lady?  Just
			how much foreplay's this gorilla need
			anyhow?!

	A TINY RED DOT flickers like an anxious firefly on the girl's 
	throught.  Suddenly --

	SHE MOVES.  Legs still in place, she swings around him to ride 
	pillion.  He guns the engine, and they pull out.

						RENZOR
					(O.S.)
			Thank you!  Crowd goes wild --

	The red dot settles on the bookshop window, and --

						SPEAKER VOICE #1
					(O.S., filtered)
			-- This one's young --

	Through the bookshop window, we see TWO MEN in conversation.

										   CUT TO:

	INT. F.B.I. SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY

	A THUMB, stabbing at a button --

						SPEAKER VOICE #1 (cont'd)
					(O.S., filtered)
			Fresh --

	A SPECTROSCOPE, leaping into high peaks --

						SPEAKER VOICE #1 (cont'd)
					(O.S., filtered)
			Like a peach --

	A LASER-MIKE BEAM, slicing out from the one-way van window --

						SPEAKER VOICE #1 (cont'd)
					(O.S., filtered)
			Camera loves her.

	Nestled hi-tech equipment in the van's  rear is JAMES (JACK) 
	REZNOR, F.B.I. Agent extraordinaire.  Grimy, unshaven.  The toll 
	of days of stakeout.  Take-out cartons and styrofoam cups littered 
	around him.

						REZNOR
			Yeah - I'll bet, ya toxic sack of puke...

	A video camera rolls quietly next to him.  His cellular phone 
	WARBLES for attention.  He reaches down, flips it on.

						REZNOR
			Agent Reznor.  Better be good.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. TACTICAL ROOM - F.B.I. H.Q. - WASHINGTON - NIGHT

	An expansive, clean room.  Dozens of manned cubicles, rows of 
	computer monitors.  Jim Cameron territory.  Christmas decorations 
	break the monotony.

	Reznor's partner JAMES (JACK) COBAIN is in his cubicle on the 
	other end, a big F.B.I. logo on the wall behind him.

						COBAIN
			Jack...it's Jack.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY (INTERCUT)

	To the side of the video-cam is an odd-looking CCD stills camera.  
	Reznor thumbs a remote plunger, takes a few shots.

						REZNOR
			Cobain - what's occurring?  Expected your 
			sorry ass hours back...where are you?

	INT. TACTICAL ROOM - F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS - DAY (INTERCUT)

	Cobain watches a CNN forest fire disaster on the wall-mounted T.V. 
	nearby.

						CNN ANCHOR
					(O.S., on television)
			"-- with close to 400 miles of woodland
			incinerated, Canadian authorities seem
			powerless to halt the blaze --"

						COBAIN
			Washington, still.  They pulled the 
			pattern.  Got me playing errand boy for
			some Vatican bigwig out to the airport.

	INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY (INTERCUT)

	Reznor jacks a wire from the stills-camera into the phone.

						REZNOR
			Shit.  Well, look...get him to say some 
			"Hail Marys."  Things are shaking here,
			just like we thought.

	INT. TACTIACAL ROOM - F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS - DAY (INTERCUT)

	Cobain shifts in his seat, suddenly alert.

						COBAIN
			Snuff movies?

	INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY (INTERCUT)

	Reznor thumbs an inset button on the camera which illuminates a 
	green:  "TRANSMIT."	

						REZNOR
			Yeah.  I'm punching what I got through.
			Speaking of things priestly, Paula says I 
			should tell you - if you work me tomorrow
			night, your tush is excommunicated.

	INT. TACTICAL ROOM - F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS - DAY (INTERCUT)

	The printer next to Cobain's V.D.U. WHIRRS, spits-out color stills 
	from Reznor's camera.

						COBAIN
			I'll consider myself doomed.

						REZNOR
					(V.0.)
			They process our backup yet?

						COBAIN
			Hold a sec.  Uh --

	He cups the mouthpece as somebody (FBI AGENT #1) passes, TOOTING 
	an extendable party whistle.  Rifles a tray of paperwork, finds a 
	requisition sheet with a SWAT header.  The co-signature is still 
	blank.

						COBAIN (cont'd)
			Tanya...this SWAT request signature?

	A pretty woman looks across from a nearby cubicle.  Shrugs.

						TANYA
			Holidays...cut-backs?  Prob'ly an 
			oversight.  Sorry, Cabain.

						CABAIN
					(back into phone)
			No change.  Nice pictures...you get a bug
			in there?

	INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY (INTERCUT)

						REZNOR
			Not a hope.  You wouldn't believe the 
			scanners these bozos use.  Running a laser-
			mike onto their window.

	INT. TACTICAL ROOM - F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS - DAY (INTERCUT)

						COBAIN
			Alright.  What I'll do is, rush these
			through Photo Intelligence...drize down 
			the second I'm through.

	INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY (INTERCUT)

						REZNOR
			Deal.  But Jack?  Give SWAT a push.  I got
			a hunch these sickos are about to move.

	INT. TACTICAL ROOM - F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS - DAY (INTERCUT)

	Cobain replaces the handset.  Sits back.  Looks at the paperwork.  
	Thinks a moment.  Drags out a punch-file marked "S.W.A.T." and 
	opens it.  Finds an old requisition.  Glances around to make 
	certain nobody's watching, then --

	COPIES THE SIGNATURE.  A perfect forgery.

	The T.V. catches his eye again.  Another CNN disaster.

						CNN ANCHOR
					(O.S.)
			"-- Our top story...a heated skirmish in 
			International Waters, Leaving Korea one
			frigate down.  Japan has already been 
			threatened with reprisals --"

	Somebody (FBI AGENT #2) slows as he passes the T.V.

						FBI AGENT #2
			Great way to end the Century, huh?

						COBAIN
					(grunts affirmatively)
			World's going to Hell in a handbasket.

	He stabs at a remote.  Flips the channel to WHITE STATIC which --

							   MORPH-DISSOLVES THROUGH TO:

	EXT. "PLAIN OF BONES" - HELL - ZERO HOUR

	A DOWNPOUR OF HORIZONTAL RAIN against a dead grey sky.  So subtle, 
	we don't get it for a second.  Then --

	The SHOT ROTATES...TILTS.  Swoops dizzyingly 100 feet.  A LONELY 
	WIND HOWLS around a figure.  Face upturned, droplets spatter her 
	face.  We recogize her:  ALICE JOHNSON, last seen defeating Freddy 
	Krueger in "THE DREAM CHILD."  She shivers, her eyes SNAPPING 
	OPEN.

						ALICE
					(softly, to herself)
			Where am I?

	She's standing on a PLAIN OF BONES AND SKULLS stretching as far as 
	the eye can see, rolling hills on the horizon.  The low sky BOILS, 
	a SEETHING BUBBLING REDNESS.  A RUMBLE like an onrushing freight 
	train GROWS.  She turns to see --

	A SINGULARITY TORNADO of MULTICOLORED ENERGY THUNDERING towards 
	her, just 100 feet away.  Chewing up the landscape...sucking 
	"reality" into it.  It's breathtaking, and it sounds like all the 
	noises in the world.

	Alice bolts as the worldbehind her CRUMBLES, sucked mightily 
	upwards.  Her chest heaves, limbs working.  Then --

	The ground QUAKES and ERUPTS, throwing her off-balance.  She falls 
	solidly amongst a flurry of SPLINTERING bones.  Looks up to see --

	THE SINGULARITY, looming large.  Unstoppable.  She SCREAMS --

						ALICE
			Nooooo --!

	A GREAT WHITE EXPLOSION hurls her through the air like a ragdoll.  
	Her arms flail, and then she IMPACTS HARD with --

	EXT. CRAGGY VERTICAL RACKFACE - HELL - ZERO HOUR (CONTINUING)

	A ROUGHLY-HEWN DARK GRANITE PILLAR perhaps 30 feet square, 
	dropping vertiginously away thousands of feet below.  She snatches 
	a handhold...it SNAPS away.  Falls about a foot...grabs another.  
	Begins a labored ascent...

	EXT. APEX OF PILLAR - HELL - ZERO HOUR (CONTINUING)

	Alice claws her way over the plateau edge.  Lies there, breathing 
	heavily.  A sibilant VOICE makes her jump --
	
						DARK VOICE
					(O.S.)
			Aaaaalicccee --

	She stumbles to her feet, finds herself looking out across the 
	plain as the Tornado decimates it.  More bones here, a SINGLE 
	ARTHRITIC TREE claws upwards, and standing next to it towers 	-
-

	SOMEBODY...SOMETHING.  Cloaked.  A vicious bladed scythe clutched 
	in one hand, a BOA CONSTRICTOR coiling around the haft.  If we 
	didn't know better, we might say it was the GRIM REAPER.

						ALICE
			Hello?  Hello...

	Alice's eyes widen as - with an eerie HISS - the figure turns 
	towards her.  But before we see the face --

	A VARIATION ON A FAMILIAR FOUR-BLADED CLAW curls disturbingly 
	around her neck from behind...

	from the passenger seat.

						JACOB
			Brake!

	Alice jerks awake from her daydream at the wheel to see --

						ALICE
			Shit!

	STATIONARY TRAFFIC on the freeway ahead, materializing at 40 MPH.  
	She grips the wheel, mashes the brake pedal hard...

	EXT. FREEWAY - BETHLEHEM - NIGHT

	Alice's red Lexus SKIDS through puddles of rain.  SCREECHES to a 
	halt inches from the car in front.

	WIDER NOW, PULLING BACK.  Her car a speck at the rear of the worst 
	Friday night gridlock you can imagine.

	INT/EXT. ALICE'S CAR - NIGHT

	Alice sits, hyperventilating.  Grey eyes wide.  We get a better 
	look at her now.  Smartly-dressed.  Mid-to-late 20s, mid-length 
	strawberry-blond hair.  Cute as a button.

	Her son stares accusingly at her from alongside.

						JACOB
			Mom, you said you weren't tired!

						ALICE
			No...I...just must have drifted.

						JACOB
			You weren't...dreaming again?  Like before?

	She gives him a look.  Ducks the loaded question.  Peers out 
	through the rain-	slicked windshield.

						ALICE
			Look at this rain.  Feels like it tailed 
			us right from New Jersey.

	She reaches down and flips the radio on.  Gets the news.

						RADIO NEWSCASTER
					(O.S., on radio)
			-- "Bizarre mass cult suicide at a Rio de
			Janeiro soccer stadium, 20,000 estimated 
			dead --"
			
						ALICE
			Getting harder to find any uplifting news
			these days.

						JACOB
			That's cause-of it's the "Fin de Sickle."

						ALICE
			The what?

						JACOB
			"Fin de --"

						ALICE
					(pronouncing correctly)
			Ah..."Fin de Siecle"?

						JACOB
			Yea.  Like, when every century ends, 
			everything goes totally nutso.  Only this
			time it's worse, cause it's, like, a new
			Millennium too.

						ALICE
					(smiles)
			Pretty slick.  Where'd that come from?

						JACOB
			French class.  Our tea --

	A RUMBLE starts-up, gaining intensity.  A spring-mounted toy bird 
	dangling from the rear-view trembles.  The car VIBRATES on its 
	suspension, the engine cutting-out.

						JACOB (cont'd)
			Earthquake!  Wow...cool!

	THEIR P.O.V. People scramble from their cars.  A traffic sign 
	ahead shakes, a freeway light swaying like a giraffe's neck.

						ALICE
					(gettign frightened)
			Virginia doesn't get quakes!

	Their gaze SNAPS ACROSS as a roadside fire hydrant BLOWS, gushing 
	water into 	the air.  A high-tension wire above SNAPS with a 
	TWANG, Jacob YELLING as --

						JACOB
			Mom!!

	THE SPARKING CABLE hits their roof, HISSING as it writhes.  
	Searing the paintwork a couple of times before dropping to the 
	roadside and becoming inert.

	The tremor abruptly ends.  Alice grabs Jacob --

						ALICE
			Jeez, are you alright--?!
		
						JACOB
			Think so...

						ALICE
			Sure?

						JACOB
			Yea...
				
						ALICE
			God...that was too freaky.

	She flips the ignition.  Nothing.  Tries it again.  This time the 
	engine GRINDS UNPLEASANTLY.

						ALICE
			Oh.  Oh, no...

						JACOB
			What's wrong?

						ALICE
			Our angel must be on coffee-break.  Jake,
			honey...something's wrong.  I'm gonna...
			have to pull us off the next ramp.

	Somebody HONKS behind.  The engine catches, sounds unhealthy.

						JACOB
					(knowingly)
			What did I say?

						ALICE
			Yeah.  Tell me about it --

	EXT. ALICE'S CAR - NIGHT

	We PULL BACK on the livid electrical scars seared into the car's 
	rooftop.  Oddly, they resemble...Freddy claw gouges.

	A mindful NURSERY RHYME TUNE TINKLESdelicately O.S. as the Lexus 
	pulls out onto the freeway turn-off...

										     CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - OUTSIDE FREEMAN HOUSE - BETHLEHEM - NIGHT
	
	Neat identical houses:  Suburban Anywheresville, U.S.A.  A 15ft 
	illuminated neighborhood Christmas tree shines like a candystore 
	beacon.

	Sheets of rain bead on telephone wires crossign the street.  Drip 
	into the tree, FIZZING and FLICKERING the bulbs.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - FREEMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

	An 8 year-old blond girl - STEPHANIE FREEMAN - eats a sandwich 
	atop the back of a chaise-longue, face pushed up against the misty 
	widow.  Stares wide-eyed as the tree flickers spastically across 
	the street.

						STEPHANIE
			Daddy!  The tree isn't working right -- !

	She climbs down, wanders back across the long room.  The 
	television plays "The Mask" animated series NOISILY to itself in 
	B.G. She glances cursorily at it in passing.

	INT. KITCHEN - FREEMAN HOUSE - NIGHT (CONTINUING)

	Stephanie's parents - STEVEN and JESSICA REEMAN - are in mid-
	argument in the cramped kitchen, a disassembled car gear box 
	neatly laid-out on the dining table.

	Steven is an odd blend of bookish and jock, his greasy work 
	overalls partially unbuttoned.  His wife is exceptionally 
	pretty...at least she would be if she gave herself the chance.  
	She seems tired, long blond hair tied back in a ponytail.  Both 
	are in their late 20s.

						JESSICA
			Steven, you made a promise!

						STEVEN
			Jess --

						JESSICA
			New Year's, 1999...a fresh Century!  We 
			always said we'd celebrate this one
			togeter, regardless --

						STEVEN
			We will...look - it'll be a fast pick-up.
			Burn rubber first thing, get this guy's
			sump.  Back in plenty of time.  You...
			me...Stephy --

						JESSICA
			Ushering-in the "bright new future"?

	She turns away to wash some vegetables at the sink, her tone a 
	mixture of cynicism and tired resignation.  Steven stops, frowns.  
	Puzzled and somewhat taken-aback.

						STEVEN
			Right.  What?

	Stephanie appears at the doorway, interrupting the flow.

						STEPHANIE
			Daddy...?

						STEVEN
					(to Jessica, persistent)
			Look, I promised the guy.  Am I missing 
			something here -- ?

						JESICA
					(to Stephanie)
			Oh - not now, baby...

						STEPHANIE
					(persistent, to Steven)
			-- Can you fix the tree?

	Stephanie picks the stick-shift up from the table.

						STEVEN
			Which tree?...don't touch that, pumpkin.

	Distracted, Steven takes it from Stephanie, replaces it.  She 
	wraps her arms around him.  Pouts petulantly.

						STEPHANIE
			Over the park.  The lights are all sparky,
			look --
		
						JESSICA
			Stephy, Mom and Dad are yammerin --

						STEPHANIE
			Puh-lease?

	She jumps up-and-down.  He ruffles her hair.

						STEVEN
			Weren't you watching T.V.?

						JESSICA
			T.V.'s for squids.

						STEVEN
					(laughs)
			Well...plumb the depths.  I'll get there.

						STEPHANIE
			O-kay...
	
	Stephanie grudgingly leaves.  Steven LAUGHS.
				
						STEVEN
			I swear, that kid's intent on setting the 
			whole world to rights.

						JESSICA
			Great.  Have her start here.

	Steven's had it.  Turns to her, baffled.

						STEVEN
			Alright.  You gonna share into this little
			secret?

						JESSICA
			Which'd be what?

						STEVEN
			You, stomping about like a poster ad for 
			Prozac.

						JESSICA
			Oh - pull a 360, Steven!  Take a wild stab!

	Steven looks wounded.  This seems to be a familiar routine.

						STEVEN
			C'mon, Jess --

						JESSICA
			No!  No, I've had it!  I'm sic of...of 
			clipping coupons...scrimping every cent.
			We've bills up the ying-yang...I want us 
			to actually amount to something!

						STEVEN
			Pushing "delete" on one of "America's Most
			Wanted" wasn't enough for one lifetime -- ?

						JESSICA
			It's been eight years since we fried Jason
			Voorhees!  Eight years!  What do we have 
			to show for it?

						STEVEN
			We got the autoshop --

						JESSICA
			You seen our bank statements?

						STEVEN
			The recession...you know it's temporary.
			We'll pull through --
		
						JESSICA
			Yeah, and it's always around the next
			corner!  Steven, we're sinking into a
			bottomless pit!  I look at other families
			with 'lifestyles'...we don't even manage a
			life!  I spend most of my life under a 
			car, up to my elbows in grease and swill!
			third-rate existence!

						STEVEN
			What do you want me to say?  I'm all outta
			easy answers!

	The message pager on Steven's belt BEEPS annoyingly.  He thumbs it 
	off, squints at the display.  Looks abashed at Jessica.

						STEVEN (cont'd)
			It's...uh...a call-out --

	Jessica turns away.  Picks up the knife.  Chops mechanically at 
	the vegetables like a Stepford wife.

						JESSICA
			You should go.

						STEVEN
					(conciliatory)
			Jess --

						JESSICA
			No. Do it.  We can use the money.

	Steven leaves the kitchen uncertainly.  We HEAR him call out:

						STEVEN
					(O.S.)
			Up for a ride, sweet thing?

						STEPHANIE
					(O.S., excited)
			You bet!

						JESSICA
					(calling after)
			Don't forget your --

	Jessica closes her eyes as the front door BANGS.  Heaves a SIGH, 
	instant regret flooding her features.

						JESSICA (cont'd)

	EXT. DULLES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

	A big 747 comes in to land on a rain-swept runway.

	INT. ARRIVAL LOUNGE - DULLES INTERNATIONAL - NIGHT

	The terminal is packed with mostly-bored PASSENGERS, not even 
	Bruce Willis and some hijackers to liven things up.

	Cobain sits on a passenger rotunda, an F.B.I. file open of his 
	lap.  He YAWNS...goes to sip from his styrofoam cup.  A FAT 
	BUSINESSMAN to his right turns the pages of his newspaper, catches 
	Cobain's elbow.  A great coffee SPLOT stains his paperwork.  
	Cobain shoots him an evil look.

						FAT BUSINESSMAN
			Sorry, pal.

	Cobain catches sight of the newspaper headline: "ASTRONOMERS 
	BAFFLED OVER DISAPPEARING STARS."  Reaches down, wipes away the 
	mess.  We see an attached "Front-and-Right" mugshot of a hatchet-
	faced guy (who we recognize from Reznor's surveillance shots) 
	registered with an "Interpol, Surete" stamp.  From the corner of 
	his eye, Cobain notices the OLD WOMAN to his left reading the 
	file.

						COBAIN
					(pointedly)
			Interesting read?

	The woman looks hurriedly away...
			
										     CUT TO:
	
	EXT "SHAMAN BOOKS" - ELM STREET - NIGHT

	An ANGLE low on the rain-speckled sidewalk.  A VAN'S TIRE enters 
	FRAME.  The door opens; a boot drops into SHOT.

	INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - NIGHT

	A dishevelled Reznor drops a cigarette butt in his empty styrofoam 
	cup.  Opens his packet of Camels.  Empty.  Glances out the 
	window...and does a double-take.  Sits up straight, instantly 
	galvanized.  Snaps-off a few more photographs.

						REZNOR
			What?  Little late-night browsing?

	HIS P.O.V., ACROSS THE ROAD.  A newly-arrived van stands outside 
	the store as a RAINCOATED MAN fumbles an adjacent yard open.  
	Reznor watches as it proceeds inside.

						REZNOR (cont'd)
			Bingo.  Pary-hearty time --

	He unholsters his pistol, thumb-catches the slide --

	EXT. YARD - "SAMHAIN BOOKS" - NIGHT.

	VERTICAL CRANE SHOT, looking down on the van as two FIGURES in 
	raincoats manhandle a struggling hape encased in a black bodybag 
	up through a fire-exit at the rear of the bookshop.

	EXT. YARD DOOR - "SAMHAIN BOOKS" - ELM STREET - NIGHT

	Rain plastering his hair, Reznor sidles carefully up to the yard 
	door, gun-in hand.  Glances nervously around, puts his face to a 
	gap in the fence.  Peers through --

						REZNOR
			Aw...shit!
	
	He pulls out his cellphone.  Flips it open --

	EXT TURRET - "SAMHAIN BOOKS" - NIGHT

	Narrow lengthwise rectangular windows glow soft yellow against the 
	silhouette of the oddly medieval turret atop the bookstore.  
	Lightning BURSTS throw it into sharp relief.  We HEAR the TOLLING 
	of a CHURCH BELL on the SOUNDTRACK...

	INT. SACRIFICIAL CHAMBER - "SAMHAIN BOOKS" - NIGHT

	A LOW ANGLE, orbiting a strange inverted "lightning rod" suspended 
	dead-center in the circular chamber.  Sculptured ceiling "ribs" 
	curve outwards, forming cabalistic pillars lining the room.  The 
	saffron glow from hundreds of candles highlights diabolic imagery 
	on the walls as the storm FLASHES through the windows high above, 
	MALEFIC CHANTING O.S.

	A wick is lit by one of several CLOAKED CULTISTS milling around 
	the room.  An ANCIENT GRIMOIRE with a sculpted cover (the "EVIL 
	DEAD" Necronomicon, seen in the Voorhees house in "JASON GOES TO 
	HELL") rests open on a wooden podium.  The LEAD CULTIST traces 
	arcane runes as he anoints the tooled silver blade of an AZTEC 
	SACRIFICIAL MACHETE with oils.

						LEAD CULTIST
			"Ro-Ta Derp...Suss-Ruv Nayala --"

	We TRACK LEFT as another Cultist totes a set of ominous iron limb-
	shackles.  Linger in PASSING the video-assist monitor of a mounted 
	camcorder.  It glitches to life, reveals an INVERTED WOODEN 
	CROSS...we CONTINUE and END on the real thing: 6ft long and tilted 
	at 40 degree slant.

	A HIGH ROTATING ANGLE, away from the Cross to a symbol carved into 
	the stone floor.  We recognize it instantly as the "Penticon" rune 
	from our ITALIAN PROLOGUE.  We hear a GIRL'S SHRIEKING VOICE from 
	somewhere just outside.

						GOTH GIRL
					(O.S.)
			Get your goddamn paws off -- !

	EXT. YARD - "SAMHAIN BOOKS" - NIGHT

	Reznor drops down from the fence top.  The ground on the yard-side 
	is slushy - he loses his balance, skids awkwardly.  His cellphone 
	falls into the mud.  He picks it up, shakes the dirt from it.  
	Crosses to the van, peers quickly inside.

	INT. SACRIFICIAL CHAMBER - "SAMHAIN BOOKS" - NIGHT

	FAST CUTS.  Chunky wrist clamps CLUNK into place.  A spirited but 
	obviously-terrifed dark-haired GOTH GIRL SCREAMS crazily as two 
	CULTISTS attempt to secure her legs to the top of the slanted 
	cross, the others stand CHANTING in shadows surrounding the 
	room...

						CULTISTS

	The Lead Cultist - the same guy from Cobain's Interpol photographs 
	- stands behind the Necronomicon podium.

						LEAD CULTIST
			Lord of Gehanna...keeper of the Fallen
			Spirits of Darkness --

	The Girl lashes a long leg at one with the force of a Bruce Lee 
	karate kick.  As Cultist #1 SLAMS back against a pillar, the cowl 
	slips away to reveal a WOMAN PRIEST with a CLERICAL DOG-COLLAR 
	beneath.

						GOTH GIRL
			Crazy freako psycho bastards...let me go!

	Cultist #2 ENTERS SHOT wielding a HI-TECH STUN ROD.  Shoves it 
	against her with a SHARP OZONE CRACK.  The Girl slumps back.

						LEAD CULTIST
			By the Abramelin Mage, receive this lowly
			oblation as your own --

	Another restraint CLAMPS around the Girl's throat.  The CHANTING 
	RISES in PITCH as her dress is RIPPED SAVAGELY AWAY, revealing the 
	bare chest beneath.  The videocam monitor begins to GLITCH 
	inexplicably --

	INT. YARD - "SAMHAIN BOOKS" - NIGHT

	Reznor glances up.  The THUNDERCLOUDS above the store are SEETHING 
	into 	TURMOIL.  He tries the fire-exit.  Locked.

						REZNOR
			Perfect --

	He pulls a Lockaid gun - a staplegun-like device - from his coat 
	pocket.  Squeezes the trigger.  Thin protruding prongs WHIRR and 
	vibrate.  He slides them into the keylock --

	INT. SACRIFICIAL CHAMBER - "SAMHAIN BOOKS" - NIGHT

	The CHANTING aproaches feer-pitch.  The Lead Cultist runs the 
	Aztec Machete's tip lightly between the girl's breasts, drawing a 
	bead of blood.  Raises the blade to shoulder height as she stirs 
	slightly and MOANS.

						LEAD CULTIST
					(rising to a shout)
			-- Hear these words of power!  Barter this
			flesh and invoke your Holy Guardian...
			"Nosferatus, Emontus...Thanos"--!

	WIDER NOW, ACROSS THE ROOM.  At the precise moment he drives the 
	blade down, we CRAB QUICKLY LEFT to --

	THE GIRL'S FACE on the VIDEO MONITOR, HOWLING in EXTREME CLOSE-UP 
	as the machee SLAMS home (mercifully OFFSCREEN).  The monitor 
	picture starts to ROLL --

										FAST CUT TO:

			Shit!  This never happens on T.V.!

	He stumbles back into the yard, takes a look around as LIGHTNING 
	FLARES above --

	INT. SACRIFICIAL CHAMBER - "SAMHAIN BOOKS" - NIGHT

	The Girl's head slumps lifelessly back.  Blood swells along 
	channels carved into the cross...weeps over the edge.  Trickles 
	into --

	THE "PENTICON" BELOW.  Disturbingly, the fluid MOVES OF ITS OWN 
	VOLITION...heading in assorted directions along the carved 
	gullies.  The Cultists register surprise and trepidation as the 
	droplets ACCELERATE and ACCELERATE and --

	TRANSFORM from matter into SEARING POINTS OF ENERGY that race 
	about the unholy 	symbol like a circuitboard ELECTRON DANCE.  A 
	strange wind GUSTS through the place, GUTTERING the candle 
	slightly.  The videocam monitor SNOWS erratically as questing 
	tendrils of power SHOOT up from the circle, ARCING through the 
	Girl's body and shrivelling her to a desiccated husk --

	INT. SACRIFICIAL CHAMBER - "SAMHAIN BOOKS" - NIGHT

	CRACKING DOWN from the inverted lightning conductor to the 
	"Penticon" which 	ERUPTS, coalescing into a RAGING ENERGY 
	MAELSTROM.  All the candles BLOW OUT simultaneously --

	EXT. FRONT OF STORE - "SAMHIN BOOKS" - NIGHT

	KER-BOOM!  The turret windows SHATTER, GOUTING EXHAUST SPUMES of 
	ROLLING ORANGE FIRE.

	Reznor dives for cover as debris showers down --

						REZNOR
			Holy fuck!

	INT. SACRIFICIAL CHAMBER - "SAMHAIN BOOKS" - NIGHT

	The ENERGY TORNADO is a WHIRLING VORTEX of RED-AND-GREEN LIGHT, 
	oscillating slightly (perhaps subliminally giving the idea we 
	might see Freddy Krueger).  The Cross has become energized, an 
	INCANDESCENT GLOWING MASS...a BLAST WAVE hits it, BLOWING AWAY the 
	Goth Girl's ashen remains.

	Cultist #3 on the periphery IGNITES, a human fireball. The Lead 
	Cultist is 	snagged by the vortex's power, the trim of his cowl 
	catching fire.  Both his skull and right arm GLOW from within, an 
	unearthly MOLTEN ORANGE --

	Reznor rainses his pistol squarely at the storefront window.

	A SHAPE forms within the tornado...a HUMANOID framework of veins 
	suspended above the floor in a fetal ball, gaining solidity each 
	moment --

	Mass panic.  Cultist #4 tries to bolt...an energy ribbon LASHES 
	out and BURNS A HOLE THROUGH HIM.

	The jaw of the transfixed Lead Cultist opens a SILENT SCREAM in 
	his WHITE-HOT SKULL --

	The Humanoid Shape is solid now, electrcal CRACKLES ZAPPING about 
	it.  The vortex suddenly IMPLODES, and --

	A BURST of LIGHT tosses the Lead Cultist ferociously backwards, 
	his face sheared away and cauterized.  The Aztec machete spins up 
	into the air, as --

	The remainder of the vortex EXPLODES and dissipates, as--

	The videocam monitor ROLLS BACK towards normality, and --

	A FAST CUT as CHUNKY CONSTRUCTION BOOTS with black crome shin-
	guards SLAM DOWN onto the reformed "Penticon", as -- 

	The machete pirouttes down, and --

	A HAND sporting fingerless open-backed biker-gloves WHIPS OUT from 
	nowhere, ENORMOUS FINGERS curling around the grip then --

	WHOOSH!  The blade immediately CLEAVES through the air towards --

	THE THROAT OF CULTIST #5, who looses a SCREAM --

	Which is interrupted as he's DECAPITATED in a FAST VIDEO MONITOR 
	INSERT.  We get a speedy SCAN-LINED glimpse of JASON VOORHEES' 
	KILLING MASK POWERING across the FRAME --

	BUT LIKE WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.  Still a HOCKEY GOALIE, but now 
	DARK CHROME with ANGULAR FACETS.  Terrifying - a regular SLASHER 
	DARTH VADER.

	INT. WINDOW DISPLAY - "SAMHAIN" BOOKSHOP - NIGHT

	Reznor knocks-in some dangerous glass shards, inadvertently 
	toppling a skeleton window display.  He clambers over the frame 
	and into the store, his shoe coming down to crush the delicate 
	plastic skull --

	INT. SACRIFICIAL CHAMBER - "SAMHAIN BOOKS" - NIGHT

	Cultist #6 SHRIEKS in terror as Jason's foot SLAMS down MULCHING 
	his head to puree.  Jason's head SNAPS AROUND as --

	Cultist #7 is there with a BATTLE CRY, wielding a sacrifiecial 
	dagger --

						CULTIST #7
			Morituri Abominati -- !

	THUNK! The dagger sinks up to the hilt in Jason's torso.  Jason 
	glances calmly down...a moment's hesitation...the man 
	freezes...then Jason impales him cleanly with his machete.

	Jason pitches back with the dagger protruding as Cultist #1 
	catches him unawares, garroting him with the sacrificial restraint 
	chains.  Jason relinquishes his grip on the machete, and Cultist 
	#7 reels towards a pillar, GURGLING --

	Jason staggers blindly, knocking the videocam tripod over.  Rain 
	SPATTERING 	the dark crome mask through the breached roof above, 
	he CLAWS ineffectively at the chains as CULTIST #1 uses her 
	mass to lever him back, and --

	Cultist #2 CHARGES Jason from the front with the CRACKLING STUN-
	ROD.  Cultist #1 SHRIEKS out in pain as the conductive charge ZAPS 
	through Jason's body and along the chains.  As Cultist #2 TWISTS 
	the tip deeper into Jason's stomach, Jason SLAMS the woman back 
	against a stone pillar, CRUSHING her.  He simultaheously SEIZES 
	the man's shoulders and --

	YANKS HIM BODILY FORWARD, the Stun-Rod SPEARING Cultist #2's chest 
	and passing cleanly through him.  Cultist #2's SCREAMING face is a 
	matter of inches from the chrome faceplate as --

	Jason PLANTS a FEROCIOUS HEAD-BUTT on him, then TOSSES him aside 
	like a ragdoll. As Cultist #1 sinks down behind him, Jason 
	extracts the sacrificial dagger from is ribcage and tosses it to 
	the ground.  Turns to Cultist #7 - alive and WHIMPERING against 
	another pillar with the machete protruding and stalks murderously 
	towards him --

	INT. STAIRWELL - "SAMHAIN BOOKS" - NIGHT

	Reznor takes the landing stairwell two stairs at a time.  Down 
	below, we can see the orderly shelves that make up the small-but-
	cluttered store.  As he reaches top --

	KER-SMASH!  Reznor flinches, half-ducks as the door leading to the 
	turret ahead SPLINTERS WIDE APART, Cultist #7's corpse WHOOSING 
	throught he air.  It CRACKS THROUGH the bannisters, PLUMMETS down 
	into the store.  BOUNCING OFF a bookshelf adn coming to rest 
	below.  Reznor gapes.

						REZNOR
			Jesus!

	A DARK SILHOUETTE steps forward from the shadows.  Reznor raises 
	him pistol, Weaver-stance.

						REZNOR
			F.B.I. ...right where you are, twinkletoes!

	Reznor gets a good look as LIGHTNING reflects fromt he chrome 
	killing mask through the skylight immediately above.  The jet-
	black boiler-suit...the dark liquid trickling along the Aztec 
	machete's rune-carved blade.

						REZNOR (cont'd)
			Drop the toothpick, buddy!

	Jason ignores him, strides malevolently forward.  Reznor CLICKS 
	his pistol's safety catch --

						REZNOR (cont'd)
			One warning only...do it!

	Jason raises the blade threateningly...and Reznor lets him have 
	it, SHOT-AFTER-SHOT.  Jason LURCHES each time the bullets him 
	home...Reznor's eyes bug at the lack of effect.  The machete 
	SWISHES down, burying itself in the broken bannister-rail.  Reznor 
	feints to the right, avoids the swing by millimeters ...loses his 
	footing on the ledge--

	AND SLIPS, tumbling down into the store.  Conveniently, the prone 
	corpse of Cultist #7 cushions Reznor's fall...but his head BANGS 
	against something, KNOCKING him out cold.

	WE FINISH TIGHT ON REZNOR'S HEAD.  Chromed construction boots 
	STOMP past on their way out into the night...

	EXT. "SAMHAIN BOOKS" - NIGHT (AERIAL MATTE SHOT)

	TIGHT ON the videocam monitor showing a SKEWED ANGLE of a 
	Cultist's face, staring sightlessly.  PULL BACK to reveal --

	A GOD'S EYE ANGLE looking 270 degrees VETICALLY DAWN at the 
	bookstore.  The shattered turret is in IMMEDIATE FOREGROUND, 
	pockets of GUTTERING FLAME in the rafters here-and-there.  Through 
	the rent in the roof, we see part of the "Penticon" and various 
	SCATTERED CULTISTS' BODIES.

	Approaching POLICE SIRENS RISE in VOLUME, O.S.  Far below, we note 
	TINY FIGURE of Jason Voorhees casting a huge shadow as it stalks 
	purposefully away into 	the darkness...
	
										     CUT TO:

	EXT. BLACKTOP ROADSIDE - BETHLEHEM - NIGHT (CRANE SHOT)

	Rain is coming down in sheets, still.  A breakdown truck with 
	"Voorhees 24 Hour Motors" markings is pulled at the roadside.  A 
	GUY in overalls and an all-weather jacket has his head under the 
	open hood of Alice's Lexus, just up-front.

	INT. ALICE'S CAR - NIGHT

	Alice watches as the guy drops the hood, SPLASHES around to the 
	driver's side.  She thumbs a control.  The window WHIRRS down, and 
	we see Steven Freeman's face.

						ALICE
			So, what do I owe you?

						STEVEN
					(shakes his head)
			I wish it were that simple...

						ALICE
			What is it?

						STEVEN
			Well.  Contacts're fine.  Battery's got a
			charge, so it's not electrical.  Oil's 
			good...something with the gas mix, maybe?
			Might even be in the engine...

						ALICE
			Oh, God --

						STEVEN
			I can put it through the shop overnight.
			You could drop-by tomorrow...

	Alice shoots a worried look at Jacob, asleep in the back seat.

						ALICE
			No.  I'm not...well, we don't live around
			here.  We were driving back, to Ohio --

	Steven scratches his head.  Thinks.

						STEVEN
			Well, then you certainly have a problem.
			I could maybe give you guys a ride?  Some
			reasonable motels, just down off the 
			blacktop --

						ALICE
			This time of the year?  This year?

						STEVEN
			Ah, I know some people.
					(grins)
			Friends in low places.  Y'know?

						ALICE
			Thanks.  Whatever.  Anything I can get
			has to be better than sleepin here, I 
			guess --

	INT. ARRIVAL LOUNGE - DULLES INTERNATIONAL - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON the second hand of Cobain's wristwatch, the TICKING 
	incredibly loud.

	WIDER NOW.  Cobain's still sitting on the rotunda.  His eyes are 
	heavy, head drooping.  He catches himself.  Repeats this 
	once...twice.  The TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT SLURS and FADES-OUT O.S., 
	and --

	HE WAKES BACK TO CONCIOUSNESS, suddenly fully refreshed.  His gaze 
	comes up, not really focussing on anything --

	HIS P.O.V., looking around.  Flurries of people hurrying to their 
	destination.  Subtly SPEEDING-UP and BLURRING into one. (We HEAR 
	the TANNOY O.S. in QUICK GARBLED SPURTS.)  A GAP appears in the 
	crowd --

	To reveal a WOMAN in a NUN'S HABIT.  We recognize her as AMANDA 
	KRUEGER, Freddy's deceased mother.  She does a quarter-
	turn...stares directly at Cobain.

	Cobain frown.  Straightens.  Hears a GREAT ECHOING MECHANICAL 
	"CLANK."  Looks up to see --

	-- THE AIRPORT WALL-CLOCK GO BACKWARDS from "12:40" to "12:39".  
	He glimpses down at his wristwatch.  The second hand is running 
	backwards, too...

	Cobain returns her gaze, finds himself standin inside --

	INT. "CHURCH VOID" (DREAM SEQUENCE)

	AN AREA OF LIGHT, bounded by impenetrable shadow.  The stone floor 
	scattered with autumnal leaves, a dais ahead.  Standing on it 
	before a VERTICAL STAINED GLASS WINDOW is Amanda, WHITE DOVES 
	fluttering about her.  The GIANT CENSERS We saw in the ITALIAN 
	PROLOBUE WHOOSH BACK-AND-FORTH between her and Cobain, preventing 
	him getting any closer.

	She locks her gaze to him.  He glances nervously left-and-right 
	into the shadows before returning it.

						AMANDA KRUEGER
					(resonant echo)
			The time of Darkness falls upon you all...
			you must choose the True Path...ahhhh --!

	She convulses, doubling over.  Hands clutching at her chest.  FOUR 
	GREAT BLOODY RIPS stain her robe's white frontispiece:  FREEDDY 
	CLAW MARKS.  Cobain makes to move forward --

	AND AMANDA'S HEAD SNAPS UP, hideously transformed into a SKELETAL 
	DEATH MASK. Before Cobain can react, Amanda EVAPORATES into a 
	SPECTRAL WRAITH and DISSAPEARS.

	A WEIRD EXAGGERATED CLACK-CLACK NOISE O.S. --

	INT. ARRIVAL LOUNGE - DULLES INTERNATIONAL - NIGHT

	Jerks Cobain back to reality.  It was a dream...a weird nightmare.  
	A GROUP of 	BLACK YOUTHS are standing of to one side, 
	incongruously playing a "NIN" song 	LOUDLY on their boom-box.  
	Cobain looks up as the status of all the flights on the arrivals 
	board NOISILY changes to "DELAYED" --

	EXT. AIRSPACE - NIGHT

	Lightning ERUPTS around a DC10, battered by storm clouds.

	INT. CLUB CLASS COMPARTMEN - DC10 - NIGHT

	Nervous PASSENGERS are shaken about in the half-full compartment, 
	many vomiting into bags.  THe internal lights GLICKER wildly.

	Halfway-back sits PONTIFF MANFREDINI.  50s, plump and 
	mustachioed...anxiously clutching a black leather briefcase to his 
	chest.  He fumbles awkwardly at the cap of a pill bottle as --

	A GREAT BLAST OF TURBULENCE sends it SPINNING from his grip.  It 
	HITS 	deck...BURSTS open, spilling tablets.  Rolls down the aisle.  
	A STEWARDESS stops its progress, smiles at Manfredini as she 
	swiftly replaces the pills.

						STEWARDESS
			Having a little trouble there, Pontiff?

	Manfredini grimaces apologetically.  Speaks in a broken Italian 
	accent.

						PONTIFF MANFREDINI
			I'm...sorry.  I do not...travel well.

						STEWARDESS
			Just like a good wine, huh?

	His attempt at a smile fades with another JOLT of TURBULENCE. 

						PONTIFF MANFREDINI
			The, uh...."Cabinetti"...bathroom?

	She turns, looks back down the aisle.  The illuminated sign 
	changes to "OCCUPIED" as an AILING PASSENGER lurches inside.

						STEWARDESS
			Heavy traffic...look, there's another
			cubicle back that way, if you're chewing 
			your knuckles --

						PONTIFF MANFREDINI
					(rising)
			Si...yes.  Thank you --

	INT. PASSAGEWAY - DC10 - NIGHT

	Manfredini is rocked against a wall as the plane is buffeted.

	INT. TOILET - DC10 - NIGHT

	Manfredini enters the cubicle.  Closes the door behind him and 
	TURNS --

	To find himself in a CHURCH CONFESSIONAL BOX.  The latch SCHNICKS 
	into place 	of its own volition.  Manfredini recoils, sits down 
	heavily.  The walls are panelled wood...startles as SICKLY GREEN 
	LIGHT BLASTS through the latticework separator.

						DARK VOICE
					(O.S., deep and resonant)
			Father...it's five billi8on years since my
			last confession --

	Manfredini looks around in panic as the walls compress quickly 
	inward, and --

	THE FLOOR DROPS AWAY!  He pitches forward, palms pressing aginst 
	the walls as MALEVOLENT LAUGHTER echoes.  Flames LICK up from a 
	BOTTOMLESS PIT, SEARING at his legs like a flamethrower as --

	The RED-AND-GREEN PEW - his only leverage - TILTS away beneath 
	him!  He falls awkwardly, SCREAMING --

	INT. PASSAGEWAY - DC10 - NIGHT

	AND ROCKETS BACK THROUGH THE TOILET DOOR, SLAMMING HARD against 
	the passageway wall.  He slumps, staring at the swaying door for a 
	moment...listening to the CREAKY HINGES.

	His head JERKS AROUND at a FAINT SOUND further down the 
	compartment.  A CHILDREN'S NURSERY RHYME.  HE HEARS an OILY SQUEAK 
	some way down the rear of the plane.  Stares 50 feet back to 
	see --	

	A 5 year-old GIRL in a white dress cycles into the aisleway on a 
	three-wheeled trike.  Looks directly at Manfredini.  GIGGLES 
	mischievously.

						PONTIFF MANFREDINI
			Hey...hey!

						GIRL ON PLANE
					(singsong)
			"One, Two...Freddy's coming for you --"

	She turns the trike's wheel and cycles rapidly off.

						PONTIFF MANFREDINI
			No...wait -- !

	As Manfredini makes to follow, we notice the SHADOW of FOUR GIANT 
	CLAWS moving on the wall behind him --

	INT. 2ND PASSENGER COMPARTMENT - DC10 - NIGHT

	Manfredini enters the next compartment...stops in horror.  Crosses 
	himself.  The occupied seats contain FRAZZLED SKELETAL PASSENGERS, 
	their clothes and bones STEAMING SLIGHTLY.

						PONTIFF MANFREDINI
			God have mercy --

						GIRL ON PLANE
					(O.S., singsong)
			"Three, Four...better lock your door --"

	Manfredini summons up his resolve.  As he hurries towards the 
	source of the sound --

	ANOTHER ANGLE, behind Manfredini.  MASSIVE LEGS ENTER OVER CAMERA, 
	gunfighter style.  FOUR ENORMOUS BLADES idle into FRAME. 
	Intricately etched - but shot-through with rust and corrosive 
	pitting - the tarnished chrome catches the light...

	INT. 3RD PASSENGER COMPARTMENT - DC10 - NIGHT

	Manfredini's face registers bewilderment as he enters this 
	compartment.  The seats have changed into WOODEN PEWS, each of the 
	window portals a small square of stained glass, autumnal leaves 
	gusting around.  The trike lies overturned on the floor, a spoked 
	rear wheel still spinning.  As the Pontiff crouches to halt it --

	A SPORADIC STROBE-FLASH from the front of the aircraft backlights 
	a HULKING FIGURE someway behind him.  An ENORMOUS TORSO, filling 
	the passageway and then some...24 INCH SCIMITAR-LIKE CLAWS curving 
	down from its right hand.

						PONTIFF MANFREDINI
					(unawares)
			Where are you?

	Manfredini STARTLES as the INFLIGHT MOVIE PROJECTOR starts up. 
	(Conveniently, SCENE 67 of "Wes Craven's New Nightmare.")

			You shouldn't be here --! 

	Manfredini looks around.  Sees Jacob standing accross the aisle, 
	looking at him with puzzlement.

					(O.S., on screen)
			"What's that?"

	WHAM!  Manfredini SLAMS RIGHT THROUGH a BARBED STAKE,impaling him 
	brutally. (The trike kicks up a DUSTCLOUD as it hits ground in 
	F.G.)

	A REVERSE ANGLE as the Pontiff MOANS, grasping feebly at the 
	bloody spike.  A GRIM-REAPERESQUE FIGURE with a SCYTHE LOOMING 
	over him...beyond, we see the VAST ENERGY TORNADO towering over 
	all as it approaches inexorably --

	INT. CLUB CLASS COMPARTMENT - DC10 - NIGHT (BACK TO REALITY)

	An AGITATED PASSENGER tries to hold a BUCKING and STRAINING 
	Manfredini.  Blood seeps around the edge of his attache as the 
	Stewardess makes to prize it away.  The Pontiff's face is bright 
	purple, his eyes bulging.  VARIOUS PASSENGERS crowd around, 
	ghoulishly watching.  It's almost as if he were being dragged into 
	the air.

						STEWARDESS
			Hold him down...keep him down!

						AGITATED PASSENGER
			I'm trying -- !

	A SECOND STEWARDESS stands behind, grinding tablets against 
	Manfredini's clenched teeth.  A SECOND PASSENGER comes into SHOT, 
	waving a plastic spoon.

						SECOND PASSENGER
			Get this between his teeth --!

	As the Stewardess YANKS the case away, we hear a CRUNCH --

	AND A BLOSSOM OF BLOOD ERUPTS from Manfredini's chest!

									     	JUMP CUT TO:

	EXT. ROAD - BLACKTOP MOTEL - NIGHT

	The "Voorhees Motors" truck is parked at the roadside, Alice's

	INT. CAB - STEVEN'S PICK-UP TRUCK - NIGHT

	The wipers SCHNICK-SCHNICK as Steven stares out through the 
	drizzle-speckled 	windshield.  Stephanie is next to him, tearing 
	pieces of orange peel and aiming them at Jacob's sleeping face in 
	the rear.  He turns, catches her in the act.

						STEVEN
			C'mon - knock it off, Steph.  Kid's beat --

	Stephanie complies...at least until Steven looks away.  She rips 
	another piece, FLICKS it at Jacob's cheek --

	AND JACOB BOLTS AWAKE, SCREAMING LIKE A BANSHEE!  Stephanie 
	SCREECHES back, caught unawares.  Steven GALVANIZES into action, 
	stretching over the seat to Jacob.

			It's him!

						STEVEN
			Whoa, hey...hold the phone --!

			No, I saw him!  With his claws -- !

	The sudden CLUNK of the passenger side door unlocking makes them 
	jump.  Stephanie budges over as Alice leaps in, soaked.

			I don't believe it!  This is beginning to 
			feel like nailing jello to a door.

			No luck?

			"No room at the inn."  Again.

	She pauses.  Recognizes an intense atmosphere in the cab.

	WIDER NOW:

	EXT. "APRON" - DULLES INTERNATIONAL - NIGHT

	The rain has stopped.  Blue ambulance strobes light the scene.  
	Prominently displaying his F.B.I. clip-tag, Cobain stands with an 
	AIRPORT COP watching the gurney containing the Pontiff's bodybag 
	being loaded into an ambulance.

						AIRPORT COP (cont'd)
			Paramedics say they've never seen anything
			like it.  Massive internal hemorrhaging, 
			punched right through his ribcage.  No 
			apparent cause.  Vatican's already laying
			on a special flight back for the body.

	Cobain shakes his head.  Glances over at the SOBBING Stewardess 
	telling her story to some MORE COPS.

						COBAIN
			How're the cabin staff?

						AIRPORT COP
			If brown trousers and bug-eyes are Airline
			regs, I'd hazard they're peachy.

	He reads the china-pencil writing on a big handled polybag 
	containing 	Manfredini's case and a number of loose personal 
	effects.  Hands it over to Cobain.

			Pope's Special Envoy.

			Yea.  Story of my life...

	INT. COBAIN'S CAR - AIRPORT - NIGHT

	The polybag lies on the passenger's side, the attache on top.  
	Cobain opens a brown leather pouch in his hands.  Gingerly pulls 
	out a plastic exhibition sheath.  Inside is a worn, edge-burnt 
	piece of parchment.  The Freddy glove and Jason mask illustration 
	from the ITALIAN PROLOGUE.

						COBAIN
			What the...Sam Hill...is this about?

						STEVEN
			Nice car.

			Thanks. Company.

			Yea?  Whaddya do?

			Cool.  So what's your husband think of it?

						ALICE
					(touching a nerve)
			No.  Dan...died, before Jake was born.

			Oh.  Sorry.

	In the rear, Stephanie flips through Jacob's Superhero trading 
	cards.

						STEPHANIE
			Wow..."Spawn"!  Who'd you reckon'd win if 
			"Spawn" fought "The Mask"?

						JACOB
			I dunno..."Spawn", I guess.  But it'd be 
			dumb i it was done wrong, 'cause they're
			from different Universes and you gotta 
			have a proper story to make it work --

	Steven hears the conversation.  Grins slightly.  Alice catches his 
	eye.  Smiles, then looks away.

						ALICE
			Kids.

						STEVEN
			I know.

	Alice tries hard.  Thinks of some conversation.

						ALICE
			So.  "Voorhees Motors."  This is you?

						STEVEN
			Not exactly.  My wife started up the 
			business with some money we came into a 	
			while back.  We work it together.
			"Voorhees Motors...We'll Slash Your

	Stephanie LAUGHS OUT LOUD in the rear.  Alice looks on in 
	bewilderment.

			Oh, it's, uh...kind of a family joke.

			Ah.

	Another silence.  Steven breaks it next.

						STEVEN
			Listen.  I don't wanna pry, but...this 
			"Freddy Crew-cut" -- ?

						ALICE
					(interrupting quickly)
			"Krueger."  It's nothing.  Just an...old, 
			bad dream.

						STEVEN
			A dream?

	Jacob catches Alice's quick look in the rear-view.

						ALICE
			It's not something we talk about anymore.

						STEVEN
			Ah.  Okay.

	EXT. DRIVEWAY - FREEMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

	The pickup backs into the driveway, stops.  A sloping ramp leads

			Last stop.  Chateau Freeman.

	Pools of YELLOW LIGHT illuminate the forecourt.

			Jess, the motels were all full --

						JESSICA
			She could be some crazed child molester...

	JESSICA'S P.O.V., THE LIVING ROOM.  Jacob looks around as Alice 
	hefts a chunky Samsonite case.

						STEVEN
			-- Charlie Manson's secret love-child?
			She's a lawyer, or something.

						JESSICA
			Figures. The worst type.

						STEVEN
			Be reasonable, Jess.  What was I supposed
			to do?  Leave 'em stranded on the 
			Interstate?

						JESSICA
			Yes!

	Steven tries to be placating.  Cups her hips with his hands.

						STEVEN
			Her car needs work.  Think of it as an 
			investment.  Money in the bank.  Just one
			night.

						JESSICA
			One night?

						STEVEN
			One night.  I promise.

	Her arms come up.  Slide around his neck.

						JESSICA
			I swear, my karma sucks.  I get myself 
			married to Crystal Lake's last Boy Scout.

	He grins.  Alice appears at the kitchen door, a little embarrassed 
	at interrupting.

			No, that's...really.  The least we could

			I'll help you with the bags.  Show you and

	free hand.  We see TREAD MARKS of FRESH BLOOD on the concrete 
	sidewalk left by those leaving the store.

	EMERGENCY VEHICLES are parked haphazardly out front.  Yellow-and-

	look, something wrapped within the oily rag in her hand.

						JESSICA (cont'd)
			Found your McGuffin.

	TIGHT ON ALICE. (In B.G. we nothice an ICE-CREAM VAN draw up to 
	the roadside, it's TINKLING MUSIC FILTERING-IN O.S.)

						ALICE
			What was it?

						JESSICA
			Real trippy.  Lodged amongst the chassis
			cabling.  Must've bounced up fairly hard
			from the road.

	Alice takes the soiled bundle.  Opens it, and --

	SHRIEKS!  Jerks it away on reflex.  The contents hit the floor 
	with a DISCORDANT CLANG.  Straight away we recognize TWO MANGLED 
	METAL FINGER BLADES attached to A PIECE OF TATTERED LEATHER.  THE 
	REMAINS OF THE "OLD" FREDDY CLAW.

						ALICE
			Oh my God!  No --

						JESSICA
			What's wrong?

	Alice takes a part-step back in absolute disbelief.

						ALICE
			No...it...he's dead...gone --

						JESSICA
			Who is?

	At that second, we realize the ICE CREAM VAN MUSIC has altered (on 
	the SOUNDTRACK, for our benefit) to THE FREDDY NURSERY RHYME 
	THEME.  Alice WHIRLS --

	-- As Jacob and Stephanie SING ALONG the MATCHING LYRICS, 
	playfully argumentative over the wording.

						JACOB
			"One, Two - Freddy's coming for you."

						STEPHANIE
			It's "Jason".

						JACOB
			It's not --

						STEPHANIE
			It is.  "Jason's coming for you"...

	Jessica calls past Alice, annoyed.

						JESSICA
			Stephy, I told you to quit with that dumb
			song.

	Alice turns on Jesica.

						ALICE
			You know that rhyme?!

						JESSICA
					(confused)
			Sure, it's a playground song.  From Lake
			Crystal.  Kids used to sing it, help keep
			away the bogeyman...what is that thing,
			anyhow?

	She nods at the mangled "Fredy fingers", glinting evilly in the 
	morning sun.  We END on ALICE, visibily disturbed...

	DOUBLE-TAKE --

						COBAIN

	Alice is equally flummoxed now.

	An ELDERLY WOMAN NEIGHBOR peers through a window across the

	Reznor places the drinks down.  Glances at the drawings GARISH

	puts down the remaining cups.  Alice is perusing the Vatican 
	documentation (we clearly see the parchment).

						ALICE
			Ceremonies, daggers...None of this makes
			any sense.

	We see Jessica react to "dagger".

						JESSICA
			Yeah.  Why us?

			Poser of the hour.  Except, the only

						REZNOR
					(continuing afresh)
			Eight years ago, opposite ends of Ohio
			State.  two separate spates of multiple
			homicide, bearing all the hallmarks of 
			deceased serial killers to whom you were

			unrelated...until now.

	Alice and Jessica's gaze falls to teh Vatican parchment.  They 
	catch each other's eyes.

						ALICE
			As far as I was concerned, Freddy Krueger 
			lies dead and buried.  I've a kid now  I
			don't want him exposed to my demons.

	Reznor SQUEAKS the battered Freddy blade, like you might play with 
	a crab claw.

						REZNOR
			When something of this magnitude crops up,
			Miss johnson, I'd look on it as something
			more than coincidence.  Frankly, this 
			story about a loony who comes after you in
			your dreams --

						COBAIN
					(interjects, placatory)
			-- It's a little far-fetched.

	He tosses it down onto the paperwork.

						JESSICA
			For all you know, this might be just one
			more sicko out to get his jollies --

						COBAIN
			-- Like the one four years back?

	Jessica shifts.  Reznor reacts as she pulls out a cigarette, moves 
	forward the "No Smoking" desk notice.

						REZNOR
			Sorry...there's, uh, no smoking here.

	She shoots him a look, ignores him.  Lights it.  Reznor fidgets 
	uncomfortably with the sign.

						COBAIN
			The Vatican's Been compiling detailed
			files on you both for some time, yet you
			say you've never met before yesterday.
			What do you reckon the odds are on that?

			What do you want from us?

						COBAIN	
			Just coopereation.

						REZNOR
			Mrs Freeman, your husband's not back from

			That's right.  Are we under arrest?

	Stephanie and Jacob.  Alice untnses.

						JACOB
			Mom, there's something --

						ALICE
			Back inside.  Keep the door closed...

	The kids comply.  Alice looks about her.  Spots a chunky 
	industrial flashlight atop a pair of coveralls.

	INT. STAIRWELL - FREEMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

	Alice directs the flashlight beam, cautiously descending...

	INT. STEPHANIE'S BEDROOM - FREMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

	Stephanie FLIPS the key in the lock.  jacob shoves a chair up 
	under the door handle.

						STEPHANIE
			Get it in, tight...

	INT. BASEMENT AUTOSHOP - FREEMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

	Alice's flashlight picks out dangling chains and old machinery.  
	She moves forward...taut, alert.  The back door leading out into 
	the garden hangs inward on one broken hinge the lock SHATTERED in 
	pieces on the floor.

	She sweeps the beam around the silent room.  Nothing.  Finds the 
	switch for 	the overhead fluorescents.  CLICKS IT.  The lightbars 
	WHINE, flicker to life --

	Jason is standing there right behind Alice, machete poised.  Half 
	the chromed mask is eroded away now, the flesh beneath scabrous 
	and decomposing rapidly.  She turns as Jason's Aztec blade PIERCES 
	the air...eludes decaitation by a microsecond.  It SEVERS a tuft 
	of blond hair, EMBEDS itself into STROBE and FLARE chaotically.
	
	Alice's foot catches an OIL PATCH.  She slips, falls heavily 
	against a workbench as ELECTRICAL CHARGES CRAKLE up along Jason's 
	arm, momentarily paralyzing him.

	The wrench falls from Alice's grip, CLATTERS just out of reach.  
	Jason TUGS 	his machete free, sways a little before locking back 
	on target.  Two quick strides towards Alice as she SNATCHES up the 
	wrench...brings it up in a clumsy movement which --

	-- BARELY BLOCKS Jason's next strike.  the ancient blade CLEAVES 
	OFF the wrench's grip...BASHES Alice's forehead, cutting open a 
	ragged scar.  Alice SNAP-ROLLS aside, crawls for cover beneath the 
	bench.  She drags her foot in quickly as the machete WHOOSHES 
	down, SPARKING on the stone floor.

	Alice crawls away for dear life.  Jason closes like a heat-seeking 
	missle, a hand CLAMPING around her ankle with a vice-like grip.  
	Alice YELLS...begins to get dragged back.

	Her hand SHOOTS OUT, SNATCHES at the bolted bench leg.  Knuckles 
	whiting.  Jason HEAVES MIGHTILY, and --

	-- FALTERS back, Alice's empty boot clutched in his hand.  He 
	LUNGES forward, powerfully WRENCHING the workbench aside...TEARING 
	the bolted legs up.  Jessica's  boom-box topples, starting up.  
	LOUD SLAMMING ROCK MUSIC.  Jason turns over a line of freestanding 
	shelves, blocking off the exit to the garden.  Alice scrambles out 
	of the way, gets to her feet.  Turns to face him as he circles 
	toward her.  Molten droplets fall from his mask, FIZZING on the 
	floor.  She takes in his leprous countenance.

						ALICE
			What the hell are you...?

	Jason PUNCES wordlessly for Alice.  She ducks beneath the 
	suspended engine block, backs toward the shadows.

	INT. STEPHANIE'S ROOM - FREEMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

	The kids have slid open the sash window, trying to force through 
	the narrow gaps in the secuity bars outside.

						JACOB
			Go...squeeze through!

						STEPHANIE
			It's too small -- !

										     CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - OUTSIDE FREEMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

	Steven's pickup turns the corner, enters the road.

	INT. CAB - STEVEN'S PICK-UP TRUCK - NIGHT

	A bottle of champagne is on the passenger's seat next to Steven. 
	He frowns as he nears the police curiser, sees the empty cab, the 
	running-light.  STROBING atop.

						STEVEN
			Hello?

	He draws parallel, passes.  takes a gander in his rear view, 
	and --

						STEVEN
			Christ on a crutch -- !

	EXT. STREET - OUTSIDE FREEMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

	The pickup SQUEALS to a halt, Steven LEAPING out in a rush towards 
	the dead cops --

										CUT BACK TO:

	INT. BASEMENT AUTOSHOP - FREEMAN HOUSE - NIGH

	Jason's mask GLITTERS in the spasmodic lighting.  We hear his 
	INHUMANELY STEADY BREATHING as it searches side0to-side.  His foot 
	catches Alice's discarded flashlight.  It rolls across the floor, 
	the beam casting erratic shadows, which --

	-- REVEALS ALICE moving at a crouch around the side of the Lexus.  
	She looks up, sees the dangling engine block.  Looks down, sees an 
	oil can.  Gets an idea.

	WITH JASON NOW.  He hears a METALLIC CLONG, homes pitilessly 
	towards it, and --

	-- SLIPS on the THIN SHEEN of oil clogging the floor...registering 
	the dark mass of the ENGINE BLOCK as it IMPACTS his ribs, SLAMMING 
	him back into the grease pit.

	Alice punches the big red BUTTON on the hydraulic controls.  Jason 
	tries to get his footing again --

						AILICE
			You're jammed, sucker!

	WHOOMP!  The hydraulic ramp POWERS DOWN...the raised Pontiac 
	CRUSHING onto Jason.  Alice watches with satisfaction as it 
	reaches bottom, the overstressed mechanism RISING in PITCH.  She 
	shuts off the control.  Takes a tire-iron from 	the shelf.  Bends 
	down, turns off the boom-box --

	EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - FREEMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

	Steven races up to the barred front door, rifling his pockets.

						STEVEN
			Keys...keys.  Goddamit -- !

	Forgotten them.  He races off around the side of the house --

	EXT. ALLEYWAY - ALONGSIDE FREEMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

	The garden fence RUSHES by Steven in an adrenalive blur.  He hears 
	SHRILL VOICES above.  Looks up to see Stephanie and Jacob 
	desperately trying for his attention --

						STEPHANIE
			Daddy...daddy -- !

						JACOB
			Help -- !

						STEVEN
			I'm coming...stay there!

	He CRASHES through the back gate --

	EXT. REAR GARDEN - FREEMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

	-- INTO THE GARDEN.  The security lights SNAP ON...and Steven 
	fetches up 	short, almost drops the bottle.  Reznor's CORPSE is 
	twisted up in the swing's chains ahead, wrapped tight around his 
	swollen neck.  Blood spattering his shirt.  Steven motivates 
	himself, heads for the house --

	INT. BASEMENT AUTOSHOP - FREEMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

	Silence reigns supreme.  We hear the STEADY DRIP-DRIP of OIL as 
	Alice ceases to circle the pit.  Nothing...no movement.  CLOSE ON 
	HER, as --

	-- SMASH!!  Alice dives for cover as the Pontiac's hood is sent 
	SPINNING up through the air, a SHOWER of piping and wires 
	following.

						ALICE
			No -- !

	She watches in horror as Jason's STEAMING FORM HAULS itself up 
	through the car's guts.

	EXT. REAR GARDEN - FREEMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

	Steven finds the shattered door leading into the autoshop blocked 
	by the fallen shelving.

						STEVEN
			Hey...hey -- !

	INT. BASEMENT AUTOSHOP - FREEMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

	Jason's coming straight for Alice like the Terminator.  Steven's 
	MUFFLED VOICE unbalances him an instant as Alice's fingers coil 
	around the grip of a HANDHELD ROTARY SAW.  She RAMS the unplugged 
	electrical cord into the socket as Jason bears down.  Swings the 
	saw as it TRILLS to life.  Razor-sharp teeth BITE through Jason's 
	coveralls...CHEW through his flesh, spilling forth MAGGOTS and 
	GREEN BILE.

	She SLICES again, once more.  Jason rallies with a vengeance, 
	HACKING through 	the electrical wire.  the saw SPUTTERS and DIES, 
	and Jason lunges for the kill --

	AS THE AUTOSHOP'S METAL SHUTTERS EXPLODE INWARD in a DELUGE of 
	SHREDDED METAL.  Alice miraculously escapes injury as - as 
	headlamps BLAZING - STEVEN'S PICKUP ROARS through the 
	breech...makes a "Jason Sandwich" between it and the disemboweled 
	Pontiac.

	Steven blinks the grogginess from the impact away.  As he pulls 
	the release on his safety-belt --

						ALICE
			Look out!

	Jason's fingers gouge like steel into the pickup's buckled hood.  
	He drags his undead body up, and --

	PUNCHES his rancid fist through the windshield.  Gravs a handful 
	of Steven's shirt.  YANKS his head forward against the steering 
	wheel, knocking him unconscious.  Jason's head Snaps around as --

						ALICE
			You sonuvabitch!

	Alice CHARGES him wielding a tire-iron WALLOPS him viciously 
	across the side of his head.  Goes for a second blow, but Jason 
	catches it with stunning disregard for inertia.  Slings the iron- 
	and Alice - halfway across the room.  She SCREAMS as her temple 
	catches a GLANCING BLOW against SOMETHING, SOUND and 	VISION 
	DISTORTING strangely.  A FLASH FRAME of WHITE --

								DISSOLVES US THROUGH TO:

	INT BEDROOM - VOORHEES' HOUSE - DAY (DREAM SEQUENCE)

	TIGHT ON ALICE'S CLOSED EYES.  We hear an INDISTINCT, BREATHY 
	BABBLE as we TRACK IN.  Her eyelids POP OPEN --

	WIDER.  SOFT PASTEL HUES.  Sitting in a wicker-chair, Alice 
	surveys the 50's furnished bedroom, embellished with 60's style 
	boy's paraphenilia.  The TUNE "Mister Sandman" plays on a radio 
	somewhere, O.S.  She looks down.  Sees herself wearing a blue-and-
	white "Alice in Wonderland" dress.

						ALICE
			I'm inside someone's dream...

	An ICE HOCKEY STICK mounted above the dresser, GOALIE MASKS to 
	eiter side.  A POSTER showing a 1960's "Cincinnati Cyclones" 
	linup.

						ALICE (cond'd)
			What is this?

	She hears RAISED VOICES O.S. from somewhere downstairs.  Goes to 
	investigate --

	INT. LANDING - VOORHEES' HOUSE - DAY (DREAM SEQUENCE)

	Alice finds herself with an uninterrupted view of the living room.  
	Crouched behind the bannisters at the top of the stairs just ahead 
	is a 10 YEAR OLD BOY, a hockey mask pushed up on his head.

						ALICE (cont'd)
			Hey there --

	Alice GASPS as he turns to her.  We see his FEATURES are 
	ASYMMETRIC, RETARDED...the name "jason" picked out on the breast 
	of his boiler-suit in florid embroidery.  Smiles at Alice with 
	great gentility.  Puts a finger to his mouth to indcate silence.

						ALICE (cont'd)
			Oh, God...I'm in your mind.

	(The people below in heated argument below are: ELAINE and KIRK 
	PARKER; JED LANE SR; PAMELA and ELIAS VOORHEES; MARGE and her 
	Police Lieutenant husband, DONALD THOMPSON.)

						MARGE THOMPSON
			We've got to fix Fred Krueger once and for

						KIRK PARKER
			This is the 1960s for Chrissake, Marge -
			not the Middle Ages!

						ELAINE PARKER
			You're spineless, Kirk.

	Jed turns angrily on Lieutenant Thompson.

						JED LANE SR
			We wouldn't be beating our gums if your
			bogtrotter partner hadn't screwed the 
			pooch!

						DONALD THOMPSON
			It wasn't Tim's fault...the warrant wasn't 
			signed!

						JED LANE SR
			Krueger juiced my son, cop!  Half the
			other kids in this town!  You wanna think
			about that when he comes for your little
			Nancy?!

						PAMELA VOORHEES
					(pointedly, to Thompson)
			He ought to have checked.

						ELIAS VOORHEES
			If the police can't help, maybe the F.B.I.?

						JED LAVE SR
			Ha!  Dream on, Voorhees.

	UP ON THE LANDING, Alice gazes at the retarded boy with dawning 
	comprehension.

						ALICE
					(aloud)
			Jason Voorhees was an Elm Street kid...

	DOWN BELOW AGAIN, Elias arguing vehemently --

						ELIAS VOORHEES
			If we kill that monster, we'll be no 
			better than he.

						PAMELA VOORHEES
			Elias, our Jason's scared.  Retreating 
			into a world of his own, hiding behind
			that damned hockey mask --

						JED LANE SR
			Probably done us a service.

						KIRK PARKER
			Shut up, Lane.

						ELAINE PARKER
			We need to know where you sand, Donald.

						DONALD THOMMPSON
			I can't condone vigilantism, Elaine!

						JED LANE SR
			You're either in or you're out, Thompson.
			There ain't no middle ground.

	Thompson takes a deep breath.  So do the others.

						DONALD THOMPSON
			Alright.  I'm in...

	WE END ON ALICE'S PERPLEXED FACE as we --

									     MATCH CUT TO:

	INT. PAMELA VOORHEES' CAR - NIGHT (DREAM SEQUENCE)

	Alice is JOGGLED in the rear seat of a big 50's automobile as it 
	rides across REGULAR EXPANSION JOINTS.  Young Jason sits alongside 
	Pamela Voorhees who's driving.  The boy turns and smiles at Alice.

						PAMELA VOORHEES
			You stay in the car.  Mommy's fixing some
			business...

	EXT. INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX - NIGHT (DREAM SEQUENCE)

	Pamela's shiny CHERRY CADILLAC (we recongnize it as Freddy's 
	burial plot from the end of "Dream Warriors") heads for the 
	functional factory buildings agead.

	ANOTHER ANGLE.  The car pulls to a halt outside a corrugated iron 
	warehouse.  Several other vehicles are here already.

	INT. PAMELA VOORHEES' CAR - NIGHT (DREAM SEQUENCE)

	Pamela turns to Jason.

						PAMELA VOORHEES
			If you're a good boy, we'll maybe head out
			to Lake Crystal for a little holiday...
			teach you to swim.  You'd like that, 
			wouldn't you?

	Jason nods solemnly.

						PAMELA VOORHEES (cont'd)
			Alright.  I won't be long.

	Pamela climbs out.  SLAMS the door behind her.  Young Jason 
	watches her vanish around the edge of the building.  Gives Alice a 
	quick look, then opens the door on his side.

						ALICE
			Wait -- !

	Alice promptly opens her door and follows --

								     MATCH CUT AGAIN TO:

	INT. FREDDY KRUEGER'S BOILER ROOM (DREAM SEQUENCE)

	-- Straight into a RAGING INFERNO.  CRUEL FLAMES lick the bare 
	concrete walls.  A window overhead SMASHES, a Molotov cocktail 
	BLOSSOMING.  Alice catches a quick glimpse of Jed Lane and Donald 
	thompson.

						JED LANE SR
			Burn in Hell, pervert!

	An IMMENSE BOILER lines one whole wall.  A SMOLDERING FIGURE 
	crawls from the open safety gate, DROPS painfully to the floor.  
	the Iconic striped jumper, familiar chiseled presence.  FREDDY 
	KRUEGER:  Aflame from the waist down, his face still mostly 
	unblemished.  His hat falls away as he seems to look 	straight up 
	at Alice...

						FREDDY
					(pitifully)
			Save me...help me --

						ALICE
					(incredulous)
			Help you!?

						PAMELA VOORHEES
					(O.S.)
			Jason...!

	Alice looks up.  Sees Young Jason slowly DRAGGING off his hockey 
	mask, staring down into the SEA OF FIRE.  Pamela appears.  Tries 
	to pull the resisting boy away.

						PAMELA VOORHEES
			Come away!

	Marge Thompson appears above, face contorted with hared.

						MARGE THOMPSON
			Die...D I E !

	Another Molotov BURSTS in Freddy's face.  His fingers are a rictus 
	curl of despair.

						FREDDY
			Hear me...

	GREEN ENERGY BELCHES beneath him.  HIDEOUS BIOMECHANOID DREAM 
	WRAITHS SWIRL up, COILING around Freddy...lifting him from the 
	floor.  IRIDESCENT ENERGY BOLTS as they pierce his torso.  His 
	body SWELLS UP to Schwarzeneggerian magnitude.

						FREDDY (cont'd)
			Yes...yes!!  I...am...E T E R N A L !

	His body EXPLODES in a GLOWING RED ENERGY STORM that SWEEPS 
	through Alice in a WAVE (we see Freddy's bones collapse to the 
	floor at CENTER).  The BLAST 	reaches Young Jason, momentarily 
	FLARING OUT as he turns and --

									  WE MATCH CUT TO:

	EXT. JETTY - CRYSTAL LAKE - SUNSET (DRAM SEQUENCE)

	Young Jason stands on a wooden jetty protruding out onto a 
	picturesque BOATING LAKE, the sky a BEAUTIFUL PURPLE-RED. 

	-- SEE ALICE ON THE SHORELINE, watching.  She SHOUTS...

						ALICE
			Stop!  Wait!

	The boy doesn't hear.  We see him climb down into one of the 
	boats, TUG at the mooring ropes.  Alcie SCRAMBLES along the shale 
	to follow.  Slows pauses at a sign which reads: "WELCOME TO 
	CRYSTAL LAKE - CAMP CRYSTAL"

	Young Jason's boat drifts away from the pier as Alice POUNDS along 
	the boardwalk.  With a great RUMBLE --

	-- CLOUDS SPEED ACROSS THE SKY in TIME-LAPSE, GLOWERING THUNDER 
	ZEPHYRS forming out of nowhere.  Young Jason gazes up, WHIMPERS.  
	While --

	-- the SLATS BENEATH ALICE SPLINTER and DISINTEGRATE.  She treads 
	air like Wile e. Coyote, while --

	FROM YOUNG JASON'S P.O.V., the SHORELINE SPEEDS SUPERNATURALLY 
	AWAY in all directions at 100 M.P.H.  In seconds, the retarded boy 
	finds his tiny boat adrift in the center of a VAST OCEAN.

	ALICE FALLS...SPLASHES into the icy cold water, arms flailing.  
	The CAMERA FLIPS THROUGH 180 degrees with her, as she --

	-- LEVITATES UP out of the water like the "Ldy Of the Lake", 
	miraculously dry.  She "stands" on the surface as if treading 
	PLEXIGLASS, jsut yards from young Jason's boat.

	The boy begins to CRY, pulling the hockey mask up to his face in 
	defence.  (Remember the Freddy claws menacing Nancy in the bath in 
	"Nightmare"?  Well, that's just what happens now, except --)

	EACH CLAW is 6 ft LONG...towering up, unseen by Young Jason.  The 
	boy turns...as the claws SUBMERGE AGAIN and disappear, lickety-
	split.

	A MOMENT'S SUSPENSE...and the boat starts to ROCK VIOLENTLY, WATER 
	SPILLING inboard.  Allice CRIES OUT --

						ALICE (cont'd)
			Hold on!

	She takes a "step" forward...and sinks into the water up to her 
	knee.

						ALICE (cont'd)
			No!  Somebody help!

	She takes another step.  Up to her waist this time.  The boat 
	OVERTURNS, Young Jason SHRIEKING with terror.  We see a HIGH 
	CHERRYPICKER ANGLE, a HUGE Freddy arm undulating away into the 
	depths like a GREEN-AND-RED SQUID.
	
	Alice reaches the upturned boat, submerged up the the neck now.  
	She THUMPS on the hull repeatedly.

						ALICE (cont'd)
			Let him go...let him go!

	A SPUME of bubbles effervesces around her.  A WHITE OBJECT 
	floating to the 	surface...Jason's mask.  Alice takes it her 
	hand.  Looks skyward.  YELLS --

						ALICE (cont'd)
			No!

	ERSATZ CHRRYPICKER ANGLE AGAIN, going WIDER VERY FAST NOW into a 
	UNIVERSAL PULL-BACK revealing the BLACK POOL OF OCEAN to be one of 
	the EYEHOLES in the BATTERED JASON MASK we know and hate.  
	CONTINUING FURTHER BACK as we --

						 	     SOUND SEGUE/MATCH CUT TO:

	INT. FREDDY'S BOILER ROOM (DREAM SEQUENCE - CONTINUING)

	we PULL RIGHT BACK to reveal a BIG, FRIGHTENING VERSION of 
	Freddy's boiler room.  A PERSPECTIVE TRICK of CABLING and FEEDER 
	PIPES leading to a MONSTROUS FURNACE.  Young Jason is strapped 
	spread-eagled to a 'X'-shaped TORTURE CROSS, slash marks across 
	his boiler suit.  We HEAR a DEEP MENACING variation of the "Freddy 
	Nursery Rhyme", O.S.

	A "HOLE IN SPACE" opens up, Alice falling from it in a DELUGE OF 
	WATER.  Hits MUDDY GROUNG embedded with fragments of BROKEN 
	CHILDRENS' TOYS, face-first.  Her head SNAPS UP as "Old" Freddy 
	triumphantly tears the mask from Jason's face, looks straight at 
	Alice.  Places a razor sharp finger blade under Jason's chin.

						FREDDY
			How'd you like my little puppet?  He's
			always done everything I say...

						ALICE
			Don't...!

	Freddy LAUGHS maliciously.  RAKES his claws toward Jason...

									             
	JUMP CUT TO:

	Alice JOLTS awake, Jessica crouching over and SLAPPING her cheeks

						ALICE
			Wha -- ?

						JESSICA
			Steven...my kid!  Turnit on, goddamit!

	Alice glances across.  the pickup is gone, a great rent torn in 
	the metal shutters.

						ALICE
			Jacob?

						JESSICA
			The place looks like Godzilla trashed 
			it...what happened?!

						ALICE
			It's Jason...Freddy created him --

			I don't give a fuck...where's my girl?!

	Alice gets with the program, rallies herself awake.

						ALICE
			The...bookstore --

										     CUT TO:

	EXT YARD - "SAMHAIN BOOKS" - NIGHT

	WIDE ON A WALL at the end of the yard.  Like a Kabuki shadowplay, 
	we see JASON'S MONSTROUS FORM making short shrift of TWO 
	STRUGGLING COPS.  HANDHELD - SAME SHOT - whe STEADICAM back over 
	the Cops' bodies, WHIP-PANNING LEFT to see a pair of legs being 
	dragged through the slashed OSHA tape remnants covering the fire 
	exit.

	INT. SACRIFICIAL CHAMBER - "SAMHAIN BOOKS" - NIGHT

	CLUNK.  CLUNK!  Steven is strapped to the inverted cross.  Jason 
	looms over him.

	in the center of the "Penticon".

						ALICE
			I felt something inside Jason's mind.

	She pulls a hard righ...narrowly avoids an ONCOMING CAR, its horn 
	BLARING --

	EXT. "SAMHAIN BOOKS" - ELM STREET - NIGHT

	LIGHTNING arcs across the sky with a TERRIFIC BOOM, a WHIRLPOOL OF 
	CLOUDS above.  A massive ENERGY BOLT - amost more PLASMA than 
	electricity - STABS down across the street from the bookstore, 
	RIVING a tree into SPLINTERS.  PULSING and THROBBING - almost 
	ALIVE - it SCORCHES a path across the road toward the store, 
	BISECTING a car in twisted junk.

	INT. "BLACK-AND-WHITE" - ELM STREET - NIGHT

	Alice reacts.  Grabs the wheel.

						ALICE
			Stop!

						JESSICA
			Shit!

	EXT. "SAMHAIN BOOKS"  - ELM STREET - NIGHT

	Jessica SLAMS on the brakes.  The Black-and-White SCREECHES to a 
	halt, the CRACKLING ENERGY VAPORIZING the front of the vehicle.  A 
	lucky escape.  The beam CONTINUES on...VANISHES for an 
	instant...then DRIVING down onto the bookstore turret.

	Alice and Jessica leap out of the car, run for the shop.

						JESSICA
			Come on...!

	INT. SACRIFICIAL CHAMBER - "SAMHAIN BOOKS"  - NIGHT

	Alice and Jessica BURST through a torn veil of OSHA-tape.  Stop 
	dead.

	Just barely alive, Steven JERKS and TWITCHES atop the Cross, his 
	skin 	WITHERING and PUTREFYING.  The "Penticaon" is engulfed by 
	the SWIRLING ENERGY TYPHOON.  We can about discern JASON'S DARK 
	FORM within, the esophagal-tunnel opening beneath him...

						JESSICA
			Noooo -- !

	She lunges forward.  Alice restrains her

						ALICE
			Jess, don't!

	THE OTHER-WORLDLY RIFT IMPLODES...and the chamber is suddenly 
	SILENT, empty.  Jessica collapses to her knees.

						JESSICA
			Steven...God - Steven!  No...no --

	Alice runs to the center of the "Penticon", eyes searching madly.  
	Fingertips tracing the filmy tracery of blood...

			No...no --

						JESSICA
					(hysteria)
			Great...this is great~  what do we do now,

	Alice thinks hard, frustration edging in.

			How...how?!  They're gone, there's no way!

						ALICE
			Shut up!  There has to be a way --

	Blood DRIPS from teh cross into the "Penticon" channels...

										     CUT TO:

	INT. TORCHY'S BAR - BETHLEHEM - NIGHT

	The place is WALL-TO-WALL with REVELLERS, jukebox CRANKED UP.  
	Cobain sits at the packed bar, takes a sip of something - probably 
	vodka - as someone jostles into him from behind.  He catches the 
	BARMAID's amused glance at his predicament.

						COBAIN
			I think my double's turned to a single.

						BARMAID
			Not the best night for a quiet drink.

						COBAIN
					(looks at his watch)
			No...I'm waiting for someone.

						BARMAID
					(archly)
			Aren't we all?

	Cobain watches the television mounted up on the wall WILDLY 
	FLUCTUATING.

						COBAIN
			Brownouts still?

						BARMAID
			You didn't hear?  North Pole flipped 
			around earlier.  Up is down and down is
			up.  Spiffy New Year prank, huh?

						COBAIN
					(quietly, to himself)
			"The Great Purification."

	A VOICE YELLS the length of the bar.  Cobain looks up, sees the 
	BAROWNER holding the phone and looking at him.

						BAROWNER
			Hey!  Reservoir Dog!  You the cop?

						COBAIN
			F.B.I.

						BAROWNER
			Same difference.  Phone --

	Cobain pushes his way through the melee.   A DRUNKEN GIRL grabs 
	him halfway, kisses him.

						DRUNKEN GIRL
			Happy New Cent'ry!

	Cobain pulls free, reaches the phone.  Picks it up.

						COBAIN
			Agent Cobain...?

										JUMP CUT TO:

	EXT. "SAMHAIN BOOKS" - ELM STREET - NIGHT

	Cobain's car SQUEALS to a standstill.  Jessica appears, yanks his 
	door open.  Alice right behind.

						JESSICA
			You bring them?

						COBAIN
					(really pissed)
			My partner's fucking mulched!  I want some
			answers!

	We hear a VERY PECULIAR NOISE from the meteorology above.  We 
	might SWEAR that the entire SKY seems to be CONTRACTING...

						ALICE
			No time.  Shag it!

	INT. SACRIFICIAL CHAMBER - "SAMHAIN BOOKS" - NIGHT

	Alice puts down a pair of mini "multimedia" speakers.  RIPS open 
	an evidence bag, casts aside Vatican documents.  Tosses the WOODEN 
	DAGGER CASE to Jessica.  Slides the Cultist's camcorder from 
	another bag.  JACKS a lead into the side.

	Cobain stands at the breach in the turret, looking up at the 
	weirdly shrinking atmosphere.  Turns back into the room.

						COBAIN
			Someone better start explainin' all this...

						ALICE
			All these clues, you haven't figured it?
			It's Zero Hour, Agent Cobain.  World's 
			going out with a bang.

						COBAIN
			Wait...whoa!  Reality check -- !

						JESSICA
					(abruptly)
			My husband's fucking dead!  My daughter's 
			gone!  You've a belief problem, shove it!

						COBAIN
			It's 100 percent gravity this zip-code,
			lady!  Get off the ceiling!

	Jessica has the case open, brings out the seemingly plain "Dagger 
	of Horvath".  The dagger TRANSFORMS INSTANTLY into a BIOMECHANICAL 
	MASS.  the blade 	ELONGATES, runes molding into the side.  Alice - 
	and especially Cobain- are taken aback.

						JESSICA
			Same as the one I killed Jason last time.

						ALICE
					(pointedly to Cobain)
			Feeling converted yet?

						COBAIN
					(a beat)
			So...you got a Game Plan?

						ALICE
			Replay the Cultists' incantations.  Follow 
			them to...wherever.

						JESICA
			And if it doesn't work?!

	LIGHTNING GLARES overhead.

						ALICE
			We're out of options.

	An L.E.D. GLOWS RED as she activates the camcorder.  Moves to the 
	center of the "Penticon" with Jessica.  Cobain stands to one side 
	reluctantly.

						ALICE (cont'd)
			No-one's twisting your arm.

      He hesitates.  Enters the "Penticon", feeling a little foolish.

						COBAIN
			Okay.  Beam me down.

	CLOSE ON THE CAMCORDER. The digital frame counter ticking 
	upwards...the Cultists' CHANTING issuing forth from the builtin 
	SPEAKERS.

						CULTISTS
					(O.S.)
			"Kandar...estrata --"

	Ther settled blood in the stone channels begins to glow an 
	unearthly green.  Cobain looks down dumbfounded as the light 
	ACCELERATES, delineating the symbol.

						LEAD CULTIST (cont'd)
					(O.S.)
			"By the Abramelin Mage --"

	The ancient rune FLARES. Points of energy CRACKLING the air, 
	PROBING between Alice, Jessica, and Cobain.

						LEAD CULTIST (cont'd)
					(O.S.)
			"Invoke your Holy Guardian...'Nosferatus, 
			Emontus'" --

	An IMPOSING RED/GREEN ENERGY CYCLONE materializes about them, a 
	BLAST of AIR SCATTERING the Pontiff's documents.

 						LEAD CULTIST (cond'd)
					(O.S.)
			"-- Thanos"!

	A BOLT of LIGHT consumes the FRAME, the ground beneath them 
	SHATTERING to reveal --

										     CUT TO:

	INT. "ESOPHAGUS" JOURNEY - ZERO HOUR

	A ROLLERCOASTER RIDE, their P.O.V. RUSHING LIGHT STREAMS, THX 
	QUALITY BASS WHOOSHES...what mightbe PLANETS - or ATOMS - RACING 
	BY.  FAST 90 degree COURSE-CHANGES along a TUNNEL lined wiht 
	THOUSANDS of SCREAMING SOULS, and then a WHITE FLASH --

									  FAST CUTS US TO:

	EXT. APEX OF PILLAR - HELL - ZERO HOUR

	The sole arthritic tree is ROCKED by a RAGING TEMPEST.  Three 
	AMOEBA-LIKE POLYPS ERUPT towards us from within the ground, 
	strewing bones.  In an instan, the SKULLS formed within SHEATH 
	with TENDONS and FLESH until --

	-- THE POLYPS BURST, evaporate.  Cobain and the two women fall to 
	the ground.  Weaky recover.

						ALICE
			Everyone okay?

						COBAIN
					(feebly)
			Tubular.  Now what?

						JESSICA
					(yells)
			Look!

	Everyone does.  The LEVIATHAN SINGULARITY TORNADO bearing down, 
	almost upon the jutting pillar.  A mobile Black Hole sucking the 
	three-dimensional world into it.  Alice spots a "Hell Door" - a 
	riveted steel door free-floating in mid-air - behind them.

						ALICE
			I know this place!

						COBAIN
			The door...go!

	They SPRINT for it.  Jessica gets there firs, HEAVES the pull-
	ring...nothing.  Cobain pitches in.  Still nada, as --

	THE SINGULARITY HITS the Pillar, DEVOURS it hungrily, as --

	Alice adds her weight to the door...which grinds open!  The GREY 
	VACUUM inside SUCKS at them --

						ALICE
			Inside!

	They TUMBLE through the doorway, as --

	THE SINGULARITY TEARS the Pillar apart...

	EXT. "BRIDGE OF MOANS" - HELL - ZERO HOUR (CONTINUING)

	Cobain and the women JETTISON THROUGH another FLOATING DOOR, 
	identical to the 	first.  It SLAMS CLOSED as they pick themselves 
	shakily up...

						COBAIN
			This is nuts.

	VERY, VERY WIDE.  An impossibly-long VIADUCT-LIKE BRIDGE straddles 
	an INFINITIVE SEA OF MOLTEN LAVA, vanishing off at the horizon.  A 
	(presumably infinite) number of floating doors line either side of 
	the bridge.

						JESSICA
			Now what...flip a coin?

	Conversation stops as the sky above DISTORTS, the SINGULARITY 
	VORTEX tears into the bridge.  RUMBLING TOWARDS THEM at an 
	incredible rate.

						ALICE
			Run!

	They run, the Vortex hot on their heels...ENGULFING the bridge.  
	They skid to a halt -- 

						COBAIN
			This is hopeless!

						JESSICA
			Try another door!

	No time for finesse.  They choose one randomly.  Force it open, 
	and --

	A MASSIVE LEG drops down from inside, anchors itself on the 
	bridge...MIGHTY HANDS with SCIMITAR BLADES reaching for Alice.  An 
	OLYMPIAN HEAD atop a RED-AND-GREEN-DRESSED "Richard Corben" 
	Superhero dream of a body.  THE NEW FREDDY, seen in all his 
	glory --

						FREDDY
			It's my comeback Tour!

	Freddy JERKS Alice bodily back inside...but Cobain and Jessica 
	GRAB her too in a BIZARRE TUG-OF-WAR.  Alice SCREAMS, and Freddy 
	draws her inside with finality.  The door SLAMS shut, and --

						JESSICA
			Cobain!

	The Vortex is almost upon them.  Cobain thinks fast, turns to the 
	door opposite.

						COBAIN
			This one!

	They get the door open, disappearing inside as the Vortex EATS 
	SPACE...

										     CUT TO:

	INT. MAZE OF PIPES - HELL - ZERO HOUR

	The walls are a complex labyrinth of industrial ducting.  Alice 
	plummets from an overhead circular inlet, SPLASHES into fetid 
	knee-deep water.  She THRASHES to the surface COUGHING bile.  
	Looks up to see --

	Freddy, ROARING down the perpendicular inlet toward her.  She 
	scrambles up.  Start to run as he CRASHES down, seven feet tall 
	and filling the tunnel like a body-builder.  BELLOWING into 
	persuit.

						FREDDY
			Run like the wind, Alice!

	His chest works, sucking like a VACUUM BELLOWS...BLOOWS -- 

	-- LIKE A HURRICANE, tossing Alice end-over-end.  She grimaces.  
	Clutches her leg.  Freddy LAUGHS sardonically...

										     CUT TO:

	INT. SPHERICAL SPIKE ROOM - HELL - ZERO HOUR

	Cobain and Jessica falll through the door, land in a heap.  
	Recoup, take in their new surroundings.

						JESSICA
			This is twisted.

	They're standing on a LONG RECTANGULAR PLATFORM suspended in 
	space, a "Hell Door" defying gravity either end.  The platform 
	itself is at CENTER of a SPHERICAL ROOM, rotating about it.  The 
	curved walls brim with EVIL, METAL SPIKES...a DECAYED CADAVER 
	impalled on each.  (In homage, we might recognize a "Rogus 
	Gallery" of MOVIE MONSTERS.  Decayed GILL-MEN, PINHEADS, a HORACE 
	PINKER...you get the idea.)

						COBAIN
			This is Hell.  C'mon...

	They head for the opposite door.  ten feet away when...it opens.  
	JASON CHARGES THROUGH, his machete a SILVER SLASH IN MOTION.  
	Jessica moves quickly...but the tip LACERATES across her chest.  
	She falters, hitting the platform and almost going over.  Her arms 
	dangles next to a LEATHERFACE CORPSE and chances upon...

	Cobain slides his pistol out.  Walks it towards Jason, ROARING.  
	The unead killer reels back as Cobain discharges a full-clip, goes 
	dry.  Ejects the spent mag, SLAPS in another.  Jason rallies, 
	sends the gun SPINNING.  Grabs Cobain by the neck, lifts him 
	GURGLING from the floor --

						JESSICA
					(O.S.)
			Hey, fucker!

	Jessica steps forward, an evil glint in her eye and her hands full 
	of TARNISHED CHAINSAW.  Jason tosses Cobain aside.  Examines the 
	chainsaw with healthy respect.

						JESSICA (cont'd)
			Let's finish it...

	She TUGS the actuator cord vehemently --

	-- AND THE BLADE DROPS OUT.  Hits the deck with a DULL CLUNK.  
	Even Jason STOPS as if not believing her bad luck --

	-- And Jessica SOCKS HIM round the head with the handgrip!  Jason 
	goes down, 	pitching over the platform edge and LANCING himself on 
	the spikes.  The room ROTATES around as he thrashes like a like 
	PINNED BUTTERFLY.  Cobain and Jessica bolt for the door, Jessica 
	grabbing the gun in the process.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. SEWER TUNNELS - HELL - ZERO HOUR

	2-FOOT FREDDY CLAWS GRIND along DANK STONE WALLS, SCREECHING and 
	SPARKING.  Alice HOBBLES blindly, PANTING INTENSITY edging into 
	hysteria.  Walls BLUR past as she SPLASHES through shallow water 
	to an intersection.  Chooses a route.  Freddy's IMPOSSIBLY HUGE 
	FORM fills the corridor behind.  Legs pumping like STEAM 
	PISTONS --

						FREDDY
			No one to mourn you here, sweetmeat!

	Alice stumbles into...A DEAD-END.  A "Hell Door" floats against 
	one wall, ANOTHER off to one side.  She starts back the way she 
	came...until Freddy appears and BLOCKS her path.

						FREDDY (cont'd)
			All outta options!

	She turns tail as Freddy GUFFAWS MALEVOLENTLY, GALUMPHS toward 
	her.  WRENCHES at the far door, and --

	-- A FAST IMPRESSION of SPEARS...KNIVES...DAGGERS.  SLICING toward 
	her, "Tex 	Avery" style.  She THROWS HERSELF FLUSH against the 
	side wall, THRUSTS the 	door CLOSED.  DENTS BULGE OUT from the 
	smooth metal and --

	-- A BRACE OF WEAPONRY WHOOSHES past...strait for Freddy.  A SPEAR 
	PIERCES his side, a SILVER "PHANTASM" BALL BURYING ITSELF in his 
	forehead.  As he HOWLS in AGONY, Alice FORCES OPEN the second 
	door, enters.  Freddy PLUCKS the Ball away, SHAMBLES in persuit --

										     CUT TO:

	INT. MAZE OF PIPES - HELL - ZERO HOUR

	Alice CAROMS against the walls of pipes either side of her, SHEET 
	FLAME scorching beyond.  FLOUNDERS blindly through what looks like 
	soiled, RIPPED DRAPES - in actuality, FLAILED HUMAN FLESH - 
	hanging overhead.  A HISS as Alice places her hand on a steaming 
	conduit, RECOILS.

	SOMETHING catchs at the edge of her hearing.  It sounds like 
	JACOB'S VOICE.  Her head SNAPS around...

	INT. BOILER ROOM - HELL - ZERO HOUR

	Alice enters the next room at a RUN...stops.  The CAMERA WHIRLS 
	about Alice as she turns to take in the room, the BACKGROUND 
	BLURRING with MOTION.

	ANOTHER ANGLE.  Though not large, the room has the feel of an 
	unholy cathedral.  Much as Alice saw in Jason's mind-meld.

						ALICE
			Jacob!

	ANOTHER ANGLE.  We HEAR (but not see) a door SLAM behind.  As her 
	head whips 	around, in B.G. a GREAT FURNACE ROARS to life.  Alice 
	sees it's formed from a FUSED BIOMEHANICAL MASS of HUMAN BODIES.  
	She hears an approaching RUMBLE like a FREIGHT TRAIN.  The pipes - 
	which exend up into infinity - give a SEISMIC SHUDDER, and --

	-- A LARGE REEDER-PIPE TEARS RAGGEDLY OPEN.  Freddy's demonic form 
	FORCES its 	way out.

						FREDDY
			To the moon, Alice...the moon!

						ALICE
			I want my son, you bastard!

						FREDDY
			I've already had him...
	
	He LUNGES, scimitar claws GASHING at Alice...missing as she 
	sidesteps.  A BLAST of SUPER-HOT STEAM pours out at Alice.  She 
	grabs a protruding pipe - SCREAMS in suffering...then SMITES 
	Freddy with strength borne of hate and frustration --

	-- Once...twice.  Off balance, Freddy TOTTERS against the blazing 
	furnace.  SCREAMS...first from the fire...again as the FURNACE 
	LIMBS GRIP and GOUGE at him.  Freddy BAYS like a MYTHIC 
	BEAST...TEARS himself clear.  Fixes on Alice, a SNARL splitting 
	his face.  They circle...he CLOSES --

						FREDDY (cont'd)
			Draw your last breath --

	It seems like curtains for Alice, and then --

	-- the WALLS RIP APART as if made of paper, the SINGULARITY VORTEX 
	THUNDERING in.  Freddy balks...and Alice seizes the opportunity, 
	DIVING HEAD FIRST through the open furnace doors into the blazing 
	conflagration beyond --

										     CUT TO:

	INT. "NIGHT GALLERY" - HELL - ZERO HOUR

	A dank "Caligari-esque" chamber with vaulted ceilings and pillars.  
	Cobain and Jessica appear from the shadows in a CLATTER of 
	FOOTSTEPS.

						JESSICA
			Didn't we come this way?

						COBAIN
					(shakes his head)
			Place is like a maze.  what is this...?

	The chamber kinks angularly at the center.  The walls on both 
	sides are "lined" with baroque picture frames, FLOATING just off 
	the walls (simialar to the "Hell Doors") in a staggered pattern.  
	Each one portrays a cycle of "Quicktime" "Freddy Deaths"  from the 
	PREVIOUS MOVIES, DISTORTED slightly by a "WATER-RIPPLE" EFFECT.

						JESSICA
			"Greatest Hits Collection."

	They hear a EERIE GHOSTLY ECHO back the way they came.

						COBAIN
			We'd better go.

	Jessica nods her head.  they start off.  Cobain PAUSES as they 
	reach the "kink", Jessica going over the rise.

	A PARTICULAR CHEVAL-SIZED PICTURE holds his attention.  Live a 
	window to a normal "Rockwellian" suburb:  WHITE PICKET FENCES, 
	LAWNS BEING SPRINKLED.  Bright and very "60's", less "shimmery" 
	than the others.  His brow creases as he sees --

	-- A NUN standing at the roadside...turning toward him.  Cobain 
	recognizes her from his dream:  Amanda Krueger.  He reaches a 
	tentative finger out to the shimmery surface...and the picture 
	sucks him in.

	OVER THE RISE, Jessica's suddenly aware of Cobain's absence.

						JESSICA
			Cobain!  Cobain...?

	A DARK PROFILE detaches from a pillar behind her.  Something 
	catches her sixth-sense...she pivots --

	-- And by a hair's breadth avoids decapitation by Jason, wielding 
	a HALBERD taken from the spike-room.  Jesica's hand comes up 
	reflexively, the Dagger of Horvath clutched in it.  Jason's blade 
	catches the occult weapon's edge, SHATTERING at the superior 
	metallurgy.  Jessica DODGES past him, hotfoots 	away...

	INT. ESCHER HALL - HELL - ZERO HOUR (CONTINUING)

	Jessica emerges from a stone archway.  Stops dead --

						JESSICA
			Whoa...!

	We WHIP-PAN from her to find she's looking out across --

	-- An IMMENSE ESCHER HALL, COLUMNS and STAIRS going every-which-
	way and confouning the brain.  Connecting platforms here-and-
	there...a PIT OF FIRE high-up at an ANGLE, inverted.

	Jessica hears a NOISE behind.  Turns around, sees a MOVING SHADOW 
	on the wall.  Takes a deep breath and starts along a SPIRALLING 
	STAIRWAY into the chamber's center.  Halfway down she reaches a 
	platform with an INSET METAL GRATING, her head JERKING around 
	as --

	-- A GOUT of FLAME BLOSSOMS from the "Up-Pit".  Alice tumbles out, 
	flying "down" through space.

						JESSICA
			Alice!

	Alice WHOOSHES past, arms THRESHING.  Jessica outstretches ... 
	catches Alice's grip with her own.  Pulls her to the gravity of 
	the platgorm.

						ALICE
			Where's Cobain?

						JESSICA
			Lost him, back there...

						ALICE
			We gotta get out, this place is falling
			apart --

	CRASH!  the grating EXPLODES from the floor, sending the girls 
	flying.  Freddy SQUEEZES through, his claws STABBING down for 
	Alice's face.  She moves her head slightly, two of the sabre 
	blades pinning her either side of the neck.

						FREDDY
			Your Doomsday's here --

	Jessica musters her resolve...VAULTS onto Freddy's muscular back, 
	anchoring an arm about his trunk-like neck.  She reaches 
	around...DRIVES down with the Dagger of Horvath, PENETRATING his 
	shoulder.

	Freddy BELLOWS, shucking Jessica loos.  She falls "up", lands on 
	another Escher stairway.  A CRIMSON GLOW permeated his shoulder as 
	it PERIFIES to STONE, fracture lines spreading outward.  Alice 
	SCURRIES for safety as Freddy withdraws his blade-arm, swats the 
	Horvath Dagger loose.  It falls "horizontally", lands precariously 
	on the edge of a platform dropping bottomlessly away.

						ALICE
			The Dagger!

	Jessica sees, is closer to it.  Climbs "up" a "down" staircase 
	hurriedly for it.  Freddy massages his paralyzed shoulder, his 
	blade-arm's range of movement restricted.

						FREDDY
			You'll pay now, bitches!

	Jessica reaches the Dagger, As --

	Freddy SURGES at Alice like a rhino, AND --

	JASON "DROPS" DOWN FROM NOWHERE, Alice CRASHING into him!  She's 
	knocked to 	the stone floor, breathless.  MAXIMUM TENSION as she 
	eyes the two monsters on either side of her.  Jason hesitates 
	as Freddy SNARLS at him.

						FREDDY
			The Master promised them to me...!

	Jason takes a half-step.  Pauses.

						FREDDY (cont'd)
			Don't make me hurt you again...

	We get the impression that SOMETHING SNAPS behind Jason's 
	CHROMED/DEFORMED VISAGE.  Alice throws her arms across her face, 
	as --

	-- The smaller Jason LAUNCHES across her at Freddy with the 
	FEROCITY of a T-REX...DRIVES him VICIOUSLY BACK against a column 
	which CRACKS and BUCKLES under the onslaught.  Jason's fractured 
	halberd SLICES...SHREARS one of reddy's claws, SNAPS another.  
	Freddy grimaces as the two Titans struggle hand-to-hand.

						FREDDY
			I...made...you -- !

	We can tell from the BONE-CRUNCHING HEAD-BUTT Jason gives Freddy 
	that this fact really ticks him off.  And at theat moment --

	-- ONE ENTIRE HALF OF THE CAVERNOUS ESCHER HALL SHIVERS AND 
	DISINTEGRATES.  Alice reaches Jessica.  they grab a handhold as 
	the Vortex POWERS IN to CONSUME REALITY...

						JESSICA
			Boy, you weren't kidding...!

						ALICE
			That way!

	The women head for a nearby spiral staircase as the two creatures 
	below CLASH SUPERHUMANLY amidst the GRUMBLING surroundings.

	INT. TURRET/THRONE CHAMBER APPROACH - HELL - ZERO HOUR

	Alice has an arm around Jessica as they emerge from a STONE 
	TURRET, beaten up and GASPING for air.  They PAUSE --

						ALICE
			End of the line...

	A buttressed stone walkway stretches ahead, two STAINED GLASS 
	frames staggered at intervals along it.  At the end is a circular 
	"arena", bounded by demonic sculptures curving in slightly. (If 
	we were to see this from a distance, it would resemble a 	rictus-
clenched hand.)

	Surrounding all this in place of sky or ground is a SWIRLING MASS 
	OF CHAOS.  As if we were inside a GIANT IMPLODING BALOON OF 
	KALEIDOSCOPIC ENERGY...and it's shrinking.

	With the BIGGEST BOOM we can muster (that won't blow your LOCAL 
	MULTIPLEX'S SPEAKERS), the Singularity Vortex materializes beyond 
	the turret...

						JESSICA
			This does not look good.

	They hobble/run towards the structure ahead, past the first 
	stained glass window with a METALLIC CLATTER, Cobain's Baretta 
	falls to the floor.

						ALICE
			I got it.

	Alice picks it up, and --

	The stained glass window SPLINTERS into a million shards.  Jason 
	LEAPS through, lands awkwardly.  Alice raises the gun.  Thumbs the 
	safety.  Fires.  	CRACK!  CRACK! CRACK!  The third shot RICOCHETS 
	rom Jason's silvered mask, CRACKING it half away.  The misshaped 
	child-like face beneath almost sympathetic.

						JESSICA
			Keep going...!

	They continue on, the undead killer limping in pursuit.  Past the 
	second stained glass window as --

	-- THE SINGULARITY VORTEX PLOUGHS INTO the turret behind, 
	ANNIHILATING it...

	INT. THRONE CHAMBER - HELL - ZERO HOUR (CONTINUING)

	Alice and Jessica enter the structure, shrouded by SHADOWS.  Atop 
	a CENTRAL RAISED DAIS is what looks like a SQUARE OF BLACK GLASS, 
	rotating in space.  Besides it is a THRONE, disturbingly fashioned 
	from skulls and biomechanical fittings.  The by-now familiar 
	"PENTICON" is indented into the floor, SWAYING 	CHAINS hand "up" 
	from the ground.  FLAMING BRAZIERS are dotted around the 
	periphery, CUT-OUTS DROPPING TO INFINITY in the floor spelling 
	certain death for the hapless.

	Jessica stops, face registers horrified disbelief.

						JESSICA
			Oh my God...

						ALICE
			We've found them --

	CLOSE ON THE ROTATING GLASS PANE.  Through two-dimensional, Jacob 
	and Stephanie can be seen, trapped within.

	JASON LOOMS SUDDENLY AT THEIR SHOULDER --

						JESSICA
			Run!

	Alice and Jessica separate as Jason's halberd SPARKS from one of 
	the chains.  Alice edges toward the Penticon, while Jessica makes 
	it to the dais.  Jason 	seems torn for a moment...decides who to 
	stalk.  Goes for Jessica.  She draws the Horvath Dagger --

						JESSICA (cont'd)
			Okay, handsome.  Let's rumble...

	OVER AT THE DAIS, Alice examines the childrens' GLASS PRISON with 
	frustration.  Tries to grab the edge, but it offers no purchase.  
	Pulls Cobain's gun --

						ALICE
			Hope I know what I'm doing...

	CRACK!  CRACK!  Not even a scratch...it might as well be titanium.  
	As the bullets RICOCHET, PINGING onto the stone --

	-- ALL THE BRAZIERS FLARE MASSIVELY.  No-one notices the SHADOWS 
	moving, collecting towards one point...and the chamber becoming 
	gradually brighter.

	Jesica feints with the Horvath blade, retreating.  Loses balance 
	at one point on the edge of a "cut-away".  Jason follows, WHACKING 
	relentlessly with the halberd.  Each time the blades make contact, 
	part of Jason's weapon FRAGMENTS.  Eventually, the undead monster 
	is left with what amounts to a dagger.  He tosses it ferociously 
	at Jessica.  She parries the projectile...it EXPLODES in a 
	lightblast.

	BACK TOWARDS THE ENTRANCE, the SINGULARITY VORTEX has chewed apart 
	half of the bridge...the EDDYING ENERGY BUBBLE all around 
	contracted in even more...

	BACK INSIDE, Jason GRABS one of the six-inch hanging chains, 
	WHOOSHES it in an arc at her.  She's SMASHED back into a brazier, 
	the Dagger of Horvath SKITTERING out of sight.  Burning herself 
	as --

	-- JASON'S SHOULDER EXPLODES in a SPRAY of GREEN PUTRESCENCE.  He 
	WHIRLS.  Alice is standing a short distance behind with the 
	pistol.  She taunts him --

						ALICE
			Hey!  Wanna go for Bonus Points?

	Jason hesitates.  Alice PLUGS him again for incentive.  Jessica 
	begins to circle around for the dais --

						ALICE
			Hey, stupid...I meant --

	Her face falls as Jason STAMPEDES RIGHT FOR HER, but --

	-- A THIRD STAINED GLASS PANE - offses asymmetrically - BLASTS 
	APART.  Freddy SPRINGS through, lands on Jason agile as a cat.  
	The two PUMMEL each other FURIOUSLY, an alley-cat fight of the 
	Underworld.  Alice is sent SPRAWLING to the ground.  Stumbles to 
	join Jessica at the dais...

	The battle is BRUTAL...CLASHING CLAWS and FISTS, HISSES and 
	GRUNTS.  Makes W.W.F. look like a KID'S PLAYGROUND FIGHT.  iN 
	b.g., we see Alice join Jessica at the dais.

						ALICE
			What are we gonna do?

						JESSICA
			Get the kids free, then get the fuck out
			of Dodge!

						ALICE
					(shakes her head)
			I already tried the gun --

	Jason GRIPS Freddy's throat...shoves his head into a brazier's 
	SEARING COALS.  Freddy CRIES OUT, his CLAWS flailing out and 
	PUNCTURING Jason's stomach.  They FLOUNDER to the ground, and --

	-- Are RIPPED BODILY APART by some STAGGERING PRESENCE...a GREAT 
	DARK SHAPE 	LOOMING BEHIND THEM.  Jessica and Alice freeze.  
	Alice's EYES WIDEN, follow as the two behemoths are HOISTED UP and 
	UP --

	It's IMPROBABLE...IMPOSSIBLE.  But nonetheless, THERE.  A Titanic, 
	regal figure...we recognize him from ALICE AND MANFREDINI'S 
	DREAMS.  Freddy and Jason are like Boy Scouts next to him, 
	clutched in his evil talon.

						ALICE
			What...the...Hell...is...that?!

	THANOS - Lord of the Underworld...you might even want to call him 
	Satan.  TAINTED ARMOR PLATES cover a GARGANTUAN BODY.  The "Grim 
	Reaper" cloak BILLOWS back in the maelstrom.  Enormous-yet-elegant 
	RAM'S HORNS curl tightly either side of his elongated biomechanoid 
	head, a GREAT SCYTH slung across his back.  His voice BOOMS around 
	the arena --

						THANOS
			The Father...
					(ANGLE on Freddy)
			Son...
					(ANGLE on Jason)
			Holy Ghost --

	They struggle in Tanos' grip.  Thanos LAUGHS.

						THANOS (cont'd)
			Pathetic cration.

	He CASTS Jason aside with contemptuous ease, his body BOUNCING the 
	edge of the platform and toppling over the edge.

						FREDDY
					(strangled choke)
			Master...Thanos --

	Thanos CASTS Freddy casually into the Penticon, the stone 
	GRACTURING under the impact.  GREEN ENERGY SPARKS ZAP around the 
	Unholy patters as it "glitches."

						THANOS
			Your purpose is served...

	Thanos turns to the women.  GUFFAWS at the sight of Alice 
	levelling the pistol at him.  She lowers it.  the women shrink 
	back under Thanos' coolly penetrating gaze.

						THANOS
			Intruders to my realm?  No matter You
			are inconsequential...

	thanos gestures a hand.  Two dangling chains ANIMATE, SEIZE them 
	like TENTACLES.  Hoist them aloft in a vice-grip.  Thanos turns 
	back to Freddy, crawling piifully on the stone floor.  Raises his 
	head painfully at the Dark Lord.

						FREDDY
			Our pact...we gave you souls!  Fresh 
			innocents -- !

	Thanos stalks around Freddy...

						THANOS
			Fool...bargains forget by Hell are worth
			naught.  When I kill these righteous, the 
			balance will change.  A Universe born
			afresh IN MY IMAGE.

	Freddy GROWLS deep within...betrayal fuelling him.  The 
	Singularity Vortex CHEWS the last of the bridge behind, begins 
	CHURNING at the platform.  The whole ground SHAKES like an 
	EARTHQUAKE.  Freddy rises, IMPELS HIMSELF at the towering demon.  
	Thanos' scythe WHEELS, BATS Freddy away.

						THANOS (cont'd)
			Insect.  It is time to meet your Maker.

	Thanos makes a gesture with the scythe.  An energy wave hits the 
	fallen dream killer, transmuting him into the "Old Freddy" from 
	"Nightmares 1-6".

						THANOS (cont'd)
			Remember what you were.  Weak...puny.

	Thanos stalks toward "Old" Freddy, his form CHANGING...reducing.  
	In four steps, Thanos has himself metamorphosed into the "New 
	Freddy"...but with a difference.  Thanos' malevolent eyes are 
	still there, but the "Freddy" body is DARK, OILY.  BLACK WHIPLASH 
	TENTACLES EXTRUDING then SUCKING BACK. (Think of the "Carnage" 
	character in Marvel's "Spiderman".)

	"Old Freddy" crawls away...and "Thanos/Freddy" raises an arm.  It 
	elongates into a GREAT OBSIDIAN SPEAR, punching through "Old 
	Freddy" and pinning him to the ground.  "Old Freddy"'s finger-
	glove SCRAPES hopelessly at it.

						THANOS (cont'd)
			Now...live your own Nightmare.

	the gruesome sculptures overhead SHAKE as the Singularity Vortex 
	intrudes upon the arena.  A stone chunk TOPPLES as the Universe 
	bubble closes in, FRACTURES the children's rotating glass prison 
	and BOUNCES clear.  Thanos RETRACTS his spear arms and turns 
	towards it, his scythe swelling into existence --

						THANOS
			Finally.  The convergence of all time...
			all space.  My purgatory ends!

	The women scream as the scythe arcs back to strike --

						JESSICA
			No!

						ALICE
			You bastard -- !

	Thanos/Freddy LAUGHS, cruel and cold...then goes abruptly rigid.  
	His eyes stare wide as --

	THE ANIMATE CHAINS holding Jessica and Alice loosen, the women 
	dropping to thier freedom --

						JESSICA
			The gun -- !

	A MASSIVE BELLOW escapes Thanos/Freddy's lips.  A BLAST OF POWER 
	simultaneously hits "Old Freddy", transforming him BACK to his 
	true Underworld 	form. He raises himself from the floor to see --

	-- A BATTERED JASON ATOP THANOS' BACK, the retrieved Horvath 
	Dagger butied between the Dark Lord's shoulders.  Thanos REELS 
	backward as the blade GLOWS ORANGE...Jason twisting it again with 
	a GUTTURAL SNARL and--

	THE ANIMATE CHAINS CRASH limply to the ground, norrowly missing 
	the girls.  Alice sneatches up the fallen Baretta --

	Thanos swells, reverting to his towering form.  Crackling energy 
	LICKING across his body - TENDRILS LASHING OUT at Jason.  Freddy 
	throws himself at the demon...uses his fractured blades as 
	climbing pitons, brings himself up to the Dark Lord's face --

						FREDDY
			Time to meet what you made...

	FREDDY drives the broken steel hard up, CLEAVING into Thanos' 
	neck, as --

	ALICE places the pistol's muzzle point-blank against the cracked 
	prism.  BLAM!  It EXPLODES into a thousand fragments, the children 
	falling in a heap to the floor.

						ALICE
			Jake!

						STEPHANIE
			Mommy!

	Thanos turns to see mothers and children embrace, reunited.  
	Statues CRUMBLE apart, masonry SHATTERING against the floor.  The 
	Demon sways, arms like windmills...fighting against his two 
	creatures.

						THANOS
			Noooo...I L I V E!

						FREDDY
			Try again!

	Freddy and Jason TWIST their blades SAVAGELY, and an ECHOING CRY 
	OF PAIN fills the COSMOS, as --

	-- The women and kids throw their arms about each other in a group 
	huddle, and --

	-- THE VERY FABRIC OF THE UNIVERSE ENDS IN A TOTAL WHIT OUT.

										     CUT TO:

	EXT. HILLTOP - BETHLEHEM - NIGHT (JANUARY 1ST, 2000)

	The fabric of space PUCKERS, BULGES. DISGORGES --

	-- Alice, Jessica, Jacob and Stephanie.  They CRASH in a heap atop 
	a grassy hill.  the LIGHTS of a TOWN GLOW BRIGHTLY below...

						STEPHANIE
			Mommy...

	Jessica embraces Stephanie.

						JESSICA
			Oh, baby.

						ALICE
			Are we home?

	A LOW RUMBLE, and then...POINTS OF LIGHT BURSTING WIDE OPEN in the 
	sky.

						JACOB
			Fireworks!

						STEPHANIE
			The New Year's display!

	Jessica's head drops, remembers Steven's promise.

						JESSICA
			Oh, God - w made it...we actually did it.

	Alice looks soberly at Jessica.  Nods.

						ALICE
			We tipped the Millennium.  But what
			happened to Cobain...?

										     CUT TO:

	INT. MENS' ROOM - POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON (1960'S)

	The long mirror above a row of wash-basins BULGES, EXTENDS A 
	SILVERED POLYP.  It hangs for a second, then BURSTS.  Cobain falls 
	heavily to the tiled floor.

						COBAIN
					(pained)
			Ow!  Jesus, Mary, and Joseph --

	He pulls himself together.  Drags himself up.  There's a newspaper 
	folded by the basin.  He FLIPS IT OPEN, reads the masthead:  "The 
	Springwood Gazzette."  	Very peiod.

						COBAIN (cont'd)
			1960s.  No way...

	INT. CORRIDOR - POLICE STATION AFTERNOON (1960S)

	Cobain walks down a corridor.  A COP passes him.  Through the 
	slats of an office window, he spies a PLAINCLOTHED COP slugging 
	back a bottle of Wild Turkey.  The man sees Cobain, drops the 
	bottle quickly into a desk drawer.  Exits the office, hurries past 
	him.

	INT. OFFICE - POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON (1960S)

	Cobain peeks out through the office window.  A 1960s car goes 
	past.  He shakes his head.

						COBAIN
			Quantico never prepped me for this one.

	He looks at the cop paraphernalia on the walls...the mess of 
	paperwork on the desk.  Sees an UNSIGHNED SEARCH WARRANT in an 
	open manilla folder.  He picks it up.  Reads the details.

						COBAIN (cont'd)
			Krueger...?

	Another cop -  blond Irishman whose namebadge says "Blocker" - 
	appears in a hurry at the door.

						OFFICER BLOCKER
			Through with that warrant yet?

						COBAIN
			Excuse me?

						OFFICER BLOCKER
			The powerplant?  "Springwod Slasher" 
			case?  Don Thompson and me are going over
			to bust this guy now.  You done?

	Cobain realizes the import of this moment.

						COBAIN (cont'd)
			Just about.

	He puts the warrant down.  Sees another form nearby.  Picks up a 
	pen...and copies a perfect signature.  Hands it back.

						COBAIN
			There you go.

						OFFICER BLOCKER
			Thanks.  Man, I tell you.  This is turning
			out a beautiful day.

	Cobain nods slowly...

						COBAIN
			Yeah.

	EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON (1960S)

	Cobain walks down the street, looks around.  It is as he saw it 
	through the mirror.  Sunny...sprinklers watering lawns...dogs 
	barking.  60s automobiles, white picket fences.  He nods at a pair 
	of 60s-dressed women as they pass him.

						COBAIN
			Like a dream...

	He passes a playground.  Sees CHILDREN playing in an idealized 
	way.  Hears a song, familiar to us.

	The lyrics are different.

						DREAM CHILDREN
					(O.S.)
			"One, Two...He's not coming for you.
			Three, Four...unlock your door --"

	A VOICE jerks him around.  He sees Amanda Krueger standing off to 
	the side of the playground.

						AMANDA KRUEGER
			Alright, children.  We're going now.

	The kids behin towards her.

						DREAM CHILDREN
					(O.S.)
			"Five, Six...pack your crucifix --"

	She frowns.  Cobain sees a kid alone, digging at a sandpit.

						AMANDA KRUEGER
			Jason?  Come along.

	The kid looks up.  We see the smae misshaped face, the embroidered 
	boiler suit...it's Jason Voorhees.  He reaches behind him...and 
	pulls on a cowboy hat.  Races after the other kids.  As Cobain 
	smiles --

						DREAM CHILDREN
					(O.S.)
			"Seven, Eight...gonna stay out late --"

	ANOTHER ANGLE.  The MUSIC SCORE goes DEEP and MENACING O.S. as THE 
	SHADOW of a GREAT CLOAKED FIGURE WIELDING A SCYTHE falls across 
	Cobain.  He turns --

	-- And SQUINTS up at the sun, shining through a SQUEAKY WEATHER 
	VANE of OLD FATHER TIME.

						COBAIN
			Yea.  "A beautiful day."

						DREAM CHILDREN 
					(O.S.)
			"Nine, Ten...you can sleep again..."

	And we SLAM-CUT TO BLACK, as we have reached --

						 THE END
HalloweeN 4

THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS

We open on a black screen. 

SUPERIMPOSE: OCTOBER 30, 1988

FADE IN ON:

EXT. ABANDONED FARM - AFTERNOON

A large, run down farm.

CLOSE ON: 

A cardboard skeleton nailed to the wall of a shed.

CLOSE ON: 

A bed sheet in the form of a ghost. It's gently swaying 
back and forth in the wind. 

CLOSE ON: 

A half finished barn. A tumbleweed blows by the screen.

CLOSE ON: 

A scarecrow with a pumpkin for a head. It sits on a 
tractor, an axe by his side. 

CLOSE ON: 

A fence. A sharp piece of farm equipment is hanging from 
it.

CLOSE ON: 

A Halloween style weathervane.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT - RAINING

An ambulance appears in the distance, it's headlights 
barely penetrating the wall of darkness. It's a large and 
lonely road, surrounded on either side by a thick wall of 
towering trees.

POV 

We are looking in on the two PEOPLE in front. They're both 
men in their thirties or forties. They don't talk to each 
other, just stare straight ahead. We see movement through 
the tiny window at the back. 

EXT. RIDGEMONT STATE PENITENTIARY

The ambulance pulls up to the gate. The driver honks the 
horn. A GUARD comes running out of a building. He turns on 
his flashlight, looks inside the ambulance, then at his 
clipboard. He waves them through.

		GUARD
Okay.  Go on through. 

INT. RIDGEMONT STATE PENITENTIARY

Another GUARD pushes a button on a control panel and the 
doors slide open. A MAN AND WOMAN rush in, wet. 

		ATTENDANT
All metal objects into the tray.  

	
They put the objects into the tray.

		ATTENDANT
Purpose of visit?

		MAN
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.

		ATTENDANT
You're late.

		MAN
Yeah.  Should be on the road. 

		ATTENDANT
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?

		MAN
Real charmer.

		ATTENDANT
I'll take you down there. 

		MAN
All right. 

The man and woman follow the attendant through hallways.

		ATTENDANT
First time here, huh?

		WOMAN
Hope it's the last. 

		ATTENDANT
You never get used to the faces.  Never.

		VOICE
					         (screaming) 
AHHHHHH!

		MAN
Jesus.


		ATTENDANT
Jesus ain't got nothing to do with this place. Come on. 

They step into an elevator.

		ATTENDANT
Yeah this is where society dumps its worst nightmares.  
Yeah the one your picking up-just thinking about him gives 
me the willies.  Yeah, a decade ago, Halloween night he 
murdered 16 people, maybe more-trying to get to his sister.  
Nearly got her too.  But his doctor, of all people, shot 
him six times.  Then he set him on fire.  Both of them 
nearly burned to death.  Yeah, I'll be glad to see this one 
gone. Oh yes in deedie. 

He opens the elevator door.

		ATTENDANT
Welcome to Hell.

The scene switches to a person all bandaged up laying in a 
hospital bed. A NURSE talks to DR. HOFFMAN.

		NURSE
Doctor? The transfer personal are here.

		DR. HOFFMAN
Smith's Grove?

		MAN
Yes.

		DR. HOFFMAN
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.

		MAN
Has he been prepped?

		DR. HOFFMAN
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?

		MAN
I do.

		DR. HOFFMAN
Outside. 

		MAN
(To woman) 
Check him out. 

The man and the Dr. Hoffman both leave the room while the 
woman goes to check out the patient. She feels for his 
blood pressure and then his hand falls out from under the 
sheet.  The scene then goes to the Dr. and the man.

		MAN
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was 
his patient. 

		DR. HOFFMAN
If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position 
is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's 
either transfer, retire, or die. 

		WOMAN
All right.  Lets move him.

EXT. RIDGEMONT STATE PENITENTIARY

Michael is being wheeled out to the ambulance.  

		MAN
Watch it. 

		DR. HOFFMAN
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands. 

		MAN
Yeah.  Well I guess your happy to see him go.

They put Myers in and close the doors.

		MAN
					          (cont'd)
Night Doc. 

		DR. HOFFMAN
Drive Carefully. 

They drive off, leaving Hoffman standing there. He's glad. 
Michael Meyers is finally away from him. 

INT. AMBULANCE

The woman and man are talking, an unconscious Michael 
Meyers between them.

		WOMAN
Did Hoffman say anything about living relatives?

		MAN
Yeah A niece living in his home town. 

CLOSE ON:

Michael's hand. It slowly grips his blanket. The terror has 
awakened...

RESUME ON MAN AND WOMAN

		WOMAN
And?

		MAN
And? She's too young to be his legal ward.

		WOMAN
So the state owns him? Great.

		MAN
You know I still don't understand...

Suddenly, Michael's hand shoots forward, grabbing his head. 
The woman screams as Michael repeatedly pushes the man's 
head into a wall. Blood smears along the wall. The woman 
sinks down onto the floor, screaming.

		WOMAN
No!

Michael digs his finger deep into the man's skull, drawing 
blood.

CUT TO:
 

INT. CORRUTHERS' HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

JAMIE LLOYD, Laurie's nine year old daughter, sits on the 
couch, staring out the window. An ambulance sits outside. 
Jamie is very pretty with dark hair. SUNDAY, the family 
dog, sits next to her. RACHEL, the Corruthers' only 
daughter, comes into the living room. She's about 16, 17. 
Her blond hair falls around her shoulders. She sits down 
next to Jamie.

		RACHEL
Kido. It's four in the morning.

		JAMIE
I can't sleep.

		RACHEL
What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record 
here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?

		JAMIE
Do you love me Rachel?

		RACHEL
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.

		JAMIE
Like a sister?

		RACHEL
Jamie, sometimes it's...

		JAMIE
Like a real sister?

		RACHEL
We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love 
you any less.

Jamie looks out the window and sees that the ambulance is 
gone. 

		JAMIE
Sure it does. 

		RACHEL
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.

		JAMIE
It's been eleven months. 

		RACHEL
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet 
you didn't know that. 

		JAMIE
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me. 

		RACHEL
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday. 

She calls Sunday and he follows them.

INT. JAMIE'S ROOM

		RACHEL
Sleep tight.  We'll have French toast for breakfast, okay? 
Come on Sunday. Night night. 

She leaves, closing the door behind her. The window is 
open, band wind blows inside, chilling the room. Jamie 
walks over to close it, and as she does, she passes her 
vanity, with a large mirror in the center surrounded by two 
mirrors on both sides. Thunder lights up the room, and 
Michael, mask in place, is seen in the mirror. Jamie 
doesn't notice. 

Jamie closes the window and looks around. She walks to the 
closet and opens it. She sits on the floor and picks up a 
box. She takes off the lid and goes through the various 
pictures inside. She comes to a picture and pulls it out. 
It's a picture of Laurie holding a pumpkin, smiling. Jamie 
begins to cry. Thunder rumbles outside. Jamie puts the 
picture back in the box and closes the closet door. She 
walks over to her bed and gets on her knees, about to pray.

		JAMIE
Now, I lay me down to sleep I pray the lord my soul to 
keep, if I should die before I wake I pray the lord my soul 
to take.  God bless Mr. and Mrs. Corruthers. God bless 
Rachel, God Bless Sunday, god bless me. And god bless Mommy 
and Daddy in heaven.  Amen. 

She's about to crawl into bed when the closet door creaks 
open. Strange. Jamie slowly stands up and walks over to the 
closet. She grabs the door and opens it. On the floor is 
her doll. She picks it up and sets it on a shelf. Jamie 
turns, but a creak noise behind her grabs her attention. 
She looks back into the closet, but of course nothing is 
there. She stands for a minute, her mind in overdrive. She 
dismisses the noise and closes the door.

She walks to her bed as thunder rumbles in the distance. 
Again, the closet door creaks open. Jamie just stands 
there. Why is the door opening? She slowly heads towards 
the closet, her eyes roaming the room. Suddenly, a hand 
snakes out from under the bed and grabs Jamie! She screams 
ans falls to the floor. Her tiny hands flail about on the 
floor, trying to find a handhold. She kicks and gets her 
foot free. She races towards the door. At the bed, a figure 
sits up and turns to face us, even though he is bathed in 
darkness. Lighting cracks outside, and the room is 
illuminated. It's Michael! Jamie screams and runs to her 
door, but it won't open.

		JAMIE
Help! Help me, please! 

Michael stands up. He has a knife in his hand.

		JAMIE
Help me! Somebody help me!

She finally gets the door open, only to reveal... MICHAEL, 
knife high in the air, prepared to strike. Jamie screams 
and backs up in fear as Michael advances.

EXT. HALLWAY

A door flies open and DARLENE, Jamie's foster-mother, runs 
out into the hall, closely followed by RICHARD, Jamie's 
foster-father.

		DARLENE
Jamie!

INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM

Darlene flings the closet open to find Jamie, eyes closed, 
clutching the box full of pictures. Darlene drops to her 
knees and embraces Jamie.

		DARLENE
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old 
dream. 

		RICHARD
It's okay..it's okay. 

Richard takes Jamie in his arms.

		RICHARD
Your gonna be fine. Just fine.

EXT. CORRUTHERS' HOUSE - MORNING

They're house is a nice red brick with two stories. Looks 
to be early Victorian style. In the streets, children ride 
bikes and walk. 

SUPERIMPOSE: HADDONFIELD, ILLINOIS OCTOBER 31, 1988 
HALLOWEEN

INT. CORRUTHERS' KITCHEN

Darlene is making eggs. Richard bends down to pick up his 
coffee and his tie dips into it.

		RICHARD
Dammit, Darlene.

Darlene looks over and sees his tie, wet. The phone rings.

		DARLENE
Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks. 
(Picks up phone) Hello?

		RICHARD
Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. 
I got a 10:30 with Chuck.

Rachel comes into the kitchen and begins opening cabinets 
and pulling out stuff. She goes over to where Darlene is 
talking.

		DARLENE
		(into phone) 
Hang on Mrs. Pierce. 
(to Richard) 
Not that tie, on the other side. 
(to Rachel) 
That's not the only thing your eating Rachel.

		RACHEL
Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?

		RICHARD
Found it.

		DARLENE
		(into phone) 
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? 
Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better. 
(hangs up) 
Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.

		RICHARD
Why not?

		DARLENE
Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink 
(turns to Rachel) 
Rachel?

		RACHEL
Mom, please

		DARLENE
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight. 

		RACHEL
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how 
important that is. 

		DARLENE
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.

		RACHEL
Can't you find somebody else?

		DARLENE
Its too late. 

		RACHEL
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to 
baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.

		DARLENE
Its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake

Jamie appears in the doorway. Rachel doesn't notice her.

		RACHEL
Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a 
commitment.  But now my future relationship, my engagement, 
my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been 
wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight. 

		JAMIE
I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could 
go out. 

She runs off. Rachel groans.

		RACHEL
Oh...

		RICHARD
Good job Rachel. That little girl needs all the love we can 
give her right now and all you can do is think about 
yourself.

Rachel gets up and heads out of the kitchen.

INT. JAMIE'S ROOM

There's a knock at the door. It opens and Rachel comes 
inside. Jamie sits on the bed, petting Sunday. Rachel sits 
down.

		RACHEL
Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out 
with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal. 

		JAMIE
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you 
can't.

		RACHEL
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're 
going to go trick-or-treating.

		JAMIE
I don't want to.

		RACHEL
It's Halloween. I mean don't you want to get dresses up in 
a really scary costume and get some candy? 

Jamie just sits there. Rachel has to try a different 
tactic.

		RACHEL
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we 
go get ice cream?

		JAMIE
Double scoops?

		RACHEL
		 (laughs)
Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.

INT. RIDGEMONT STATE PENITENTIARY CORRIDOR

DR. LOOMIS walks down the hallway, limping. He has burn 
scars on his face and hand. He walks to a door.

INT. DR. HOFFMAN'S OFFICE

Hoffman sits at his desk, typing.

		LOOMIS
Why wasn't I notified?

		DR. HOFFMAN
About what?

		LOOMIS
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of 
here.

		DR. HOFFMAN
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it 
for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal 
patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to 
federal law.

		LOOMIS
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We 
are talking about evil on two legs.

		DR. HOFFMAN
I can see this is useless.

		Loomis
Do you know what today is? Do you know the date? Everyday I 
look at myself in the mirror and everyday I remember. Look 
at me Hoffman, take a good look. 

He holds up his hand and indicates his face.

		LOOMIS
I don't want to have anyone live through that night again. 

		DR. HOFFMAN
I've said this before. I think your the one who needs 
medical help.

His phone rings. He answers it.

		DR. HOFFMAN
Yes, Dr. Hoffman...I see...I see...thank you. 

He hangs up. He looks at Loomis, not sure how to say this.

		DR. HOFFMAN
Apparently there was an accident. Just south of Mill Creek 
near the...

But Loomis isn't listening. He bolts to the door.

		DR. HOFFMAN
Loomis! Loomis!

EXT. ROAD/ACCIDENT SCENE

Road flares are lit and tossed on the ground. Police tape 
is strung up. Loomis's car comes roaring down the road. It 
pulls up to the accident scene. An OFFICER waves them, on. 
The car comes to a stop and Loomis and Dr. Hoffman climb 
out.

		LOOMIS
Is that it? 

He points to the overturned ambulance in the pond.

		DR. HOFFMAN
Yes. 

A COP comes over to them. 

		DR. HOFFMAN
When did this happen?

		COP
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the 
storm. Come down the embankment. It happens. 

		DR. HOFFMAN
An accident?

		COP
Yes, sir.

		LOOMIS
Do you believe that?

He starts walking towards the pond. Dr. Hoffman can't 
believe Loomis.

		DR. HOFFMAN
Why shouldn't I?

		LOOMIS
How many people in the bus?

		DR. HOFFMAN
Four plus Myers.

		LOOMIS
How many bodies did you find? 

		COP
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.

		DR. HOFFMAN
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone. 

Loomis just stands there for a minute, then walks into the 
pond. The water is not very high, and Loomis uses his cane 
for support. He walks to the back of the ambulance and 
looks inside. Everything is bloody. The bed is tipped and 
splattered with blood. Loomis knows what happened. He 
knows. Loomis turns away from the scene of bloody carnage 
and walks back to shore.

		LOOMIS
He's gone. He was here, and he's gone.

		Dr. HOFFMAN
Did you find any other bodies?

		COP
Not yet. There's a lot of ground to cover.

		LOOMIS
You won't find him. He's done all this. Now he's escaped.

		Dr. HOFFMAN
You don't know that. Michael could have been thrown from 
the bus. 

		COP
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site. 

		DR. HOFFMAN
Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his 
muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a 
chance to search. 

		LOOMIS
Your talking about him as if he were a human being. That 
part of him died years ago.

He begins walking back to his car.

		DR. HOFFMAN
Now where are you going?

		LOOMIS
Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me 
through the local police. If you didn't find him in four 
hours, I'm sure I will.

INT. GARAGE/GAS STATION

A MECHANIC works underneath a car. He calls out to another 
mechanic.

		MECHANIC
Hey, Gar! How about a 9/16 wrench over here?!

He gets no response. He wipes off his hands with a rag and 
slides out from underneath the car. He gasps. 

MICHAEL

stands above him, pole in hand. He smashes it into the 
mechanic's stomach, killing him instantly.

EXT. GAS STATION

Loomis's car pulls up to the gas station. Loomis turns the 
car off and gets outside. He yells out to the gas station.

		LOOMIS
Hey! Hey there! Hello? 

No response. Loomis grabs the gas nozzle. He bends his 
license plate back and unscrews the cap lid.

POV - THROUGH GARAGE WINDOW

Someone is watching Loomis as he pumps gas. 

ANGLE ON - LOOMIS

He finishes pumping the gas and places the nozzle back on 
the pump. He reaches into his coat for his wallet. He walks 
into the garage.

INT. GARAGE

Loomis searches through the garage.

		LOOMIS
Hello? Hello? Is anybody here? Hello? Hello?

Loomis passes a big hook, and suddenly there's a rattling 
behind him. He turns to see the mechanic, tied up with 
chains, dead. Loomis races outside.

EXT. GARAGE

Loomis races for the small store next to the garage.

INT. STORE

Loomis throws open the door and looks around.

		LOOMIS
Is anybody here? 

No response. Loomis pulls out his small gun. He spots a 
phone behind the counter. He races to it, but stops when he 
sees the dead waitress laying on the ground.

		LOOMIS
God in heaven. 


He looks at the phone, but it's broken. Loomis glances 
around the store, and sees a pay phone on the back wall. He 
walks over to it and grabs the phone. The cord has been 
ripped out. Suddenly, he feels eyes on his back. He turns.

		LOOMIS
Michael? 

And sure enough, there is Michael, wearing a pair of 
coveralls, standing in the doorway to the kitchen.

		LOOMIS
Why now? You waited 10 years. I knew this day would come. 
Don't go to Haddonfield. 

He takes a step closer to Michael.

		LOOMIS
If you want another victim take me, but leave those people 
in peace. Please Michael...God Damn you...

He raises the gun and fires two or three times before 
realizing Michael is gone... He rushes to the window and 
peers outside. He hears a car door slam close.

EXT. GAS STATION

Loomis comes outside and looks around.

		LOOMIS
Michael?!

Suddenly, the garage door breaks open as the towing truck 
comes roaring outside. Loomis takes aim and fires, but his 
bullets do nothing to stop the truck. Loomis jumps out of 
the way. The truck hits one of the pumps, tossing it into 
the air. Fire erupts, engulfing the other pump, then 
Loomis's car. A huge explosion ensues. Loomis jumps behind 
some barrels. The truck takes off down the road. The fire 
spreads to the electrical pole and blows the fuse box. The 
wires snap free. 

INT. JAMIE'S SCHOOL

The bell rings and all the children come pouring out. They 
all wear costumes, except Jamie. She goes over to a rack 
and grabs her lunch box. Three KIDS surround her.

		BOY 1
Hey Jamie! Where's your costume?

		BOY 2
Where's your mask? Or are you wearing it?

		JAMIE
I don't need to wear a stupid costume.

		BOY 1
That's because everyday is Halloween at Jamie's house. 
Right Jamie. Because your uncle is the bogeyman.

The kids start chanting bogeyman.

		GIRL
How come your mommy didn't make you a costume?

		BOY 2
How could she? Her mommy's dead.

		BOY 1
Jamie's Mommy's a mummy.

		JAMIE
Stop it okay? Stop it

She starts walking away. The kids begin chanting, "Jamie's 
an orphan."

		JAMIE
Stop it. Please Stop it. 

EXT. SCHOOL

Jamie runs outside, but the kids' chants still haunt her. 
She runs over to a tree and begins crying. She immediately 
stops.

		JAMIE.
You're okay. You're okay. 

A car pulls up. Rachel sticks her arm out and waves.

		RACHEL
Jamie! 

Jamie turns. Rachel notices that something is wrong.

		RACHEL
Jamie, are you okay?

Jamie gets in the car and they drive off.

INT. CAR

Jamie sits in between Rachel and her friend Lindsay.

		RACHEL
You remember Lindsay don't you?

		LINDSAY
Hi Jamie.

		JAMIE
Hi. 

		RACHEL
You ready for some Ice Cream?

		JAMIE
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.

		RACHEL
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.

		LINDSAY
You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween 
costumes. 

		RACHEL
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.

		LINDSAY
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?

		RACHEL
I don't want to look pushy.

		LINDSAY
You won't look pushy.

		RACHEL
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl 
to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that. 

		LINDSAY
You won't come on too strong.

		RACHEL
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.

		LINDSAY
Fact it Rach, you are desperate. (silence) Your just going 
to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit. 

		RACHEL
I don't know. 

		LINDSAY
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy 
Queen?

		RACHEL
Jamie? 

		JAMIE
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?

		RACHEL
You bet.  

They continue driving.

INT. DISCOUNT MART

WADE, a teen around Rachel's age, tries on sunglasses, 
looking into a mirror. But he's really staring at KELLY, a 
beautiful blond teen with looks that could kill. The only 
problem is she's Sheriff Meeker's daughter. BRADY, Rachel's 
boyfriend, and another GUY are by Wade. Brady stands behind 
a counter while the guy stands next to Wade. 

		BRADY
Hey Wade, why don't you go ahead and make your move?

		WADE
Don't rush me Brady. Timings got to be premo.

		BRADY
Yeah well, money talks and bullshit walks. you know what I 
mean? 

He throws a wad of bills onto the counter.

		GUY
Double or nothing you don't ask Kelly out. 

		BRADY
All right, ten bucks. Lets see it. 

Wade and the guy place their money on the counter.

		GUY
He's not gonna do it.

		BRADY
Chicken.

		GUY
Don't forget man, she's Sheriff Meeker's daughter

		WADE
Her Daddy don't scare me. 

He makes his way over to Kelly, who is standing on a step 
stool, placing bottles onto a shelf. Wade coughs to get her 
attention. She turns and looks at him.

		KELLY
Fuck off Wade.

Wade turns to Brady and the guy, hurt. Kelly goes back to 
shelving bottles. Brady and the guy start laughing.

EXT. DISCOUNT MART

Lindsay's car pulls up to the curb and stops. Rachel and 
Jamie get out. Rachel calls to Lindsay.

		RACHEL
Call me.

		LINDSAY
Okay, bye.

They go inside and Lindsay drives off. We see a familiar 
tow truck sitting opposite the Discount Mart...

INT. DISCOUNT MART

Brady immediately spots Rachel and Jamie as they walk 
inside.


		BRADY
Rachel! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed 
to pick you up?

		RACHEL
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.

		BRADY
					          (to Jamie)
You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes 
in the whole town.

		JAMIE
					         (to Rachel)
Come on Rachel.

		RACHEL
In a second. 

Jamie heads for the costumes aisle while Rachel talks to 
Brady.

		RACHEL
We need to talk.

		BRADY
Okay sure. What about?

		RACHEL
Its about tonight.

CUT TO:

Jamie, wandering the aisles. There are all sorts of masks. 
She passes by a white one. She looks through the racks and 
sees a clown costume.

		JAMIE
Rachel, I found the perfect costume come see.

CUT TO:

Rachel and Brady kissing. Rachel pulls away.

		BRADY
What?

		RACHEL
My parents baby-sitter canceled.

		BRADY
So?

		RACHEL
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.

		BRADY
When did you find this out?

		RACHEL
This morning.

		BRADY
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me 
before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit

		RACHEL
Don't get angry.

		BRADY
I'm not angry it's just 

Kelly looks over. A plan is forming in her head.

		BRADY
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?

		RACHEL
My parents are going to come home early tonight.

					BRADY
So?

		RACHEL
I don't know Brady.

		BRADY
Okay, I guess. I'll call you later. 

He walks away.

CUT TO:

Jamie looks at herself in the mirror with the costume. On 
another aisle, a burned hand reaches down and grabs the 
white mask. Jamie continues to look into the mirror, when 
suddenly her image changes to a little boy in a clown 
costume holding a knife. She steps back in fear and bumps 
into Michael. He pulls on the white mask. He reaches out 
for her and Jamie screams. She backs up into the mirror, 
shattering it. Shards of glass go flying. Jamie sinks to 
the ground. Rachel comes running over, and Michael is no 
where to be seen.

		RACHEL
Jamie, what happened?

		JAMIE
It was the nightmare man

		RACHEL
What?

		JAMIE
He's coming to get me Rachel. 

Kelly walks over.

		RACHEL
Your okay. You probably saw a mask and it scared you. At 
least your not cut. Come on, lets go home.

Brady, Wade, and the Guy come over.

		GUY
Everything okay?

		RACHEL
She'll be fine.

They get up and leave. Nobody notices Michael's reflection 
in a broken piece of glass...

EXT. ROAD - MIDDLE OF NOWHERE

Loomis walks down the road, beat. His throat is parched and 
his feet are tired, but he marches on. A station wagon 
speeds down the road, and Loomis tries to flag it down, bit 
it speeds past him. A car speeds past him, then stops. It's 
full of CHEERLEADERS and a GUY

		GUY
Come on old man!

Loomis begins hobbling towards the car while the 
cheerleaders shout at him to hurry. As he gets closer, the 
car takes off, making dust fly into the air. We can hear 
the people laughing. Loomis stands in the road, rejected. 
Suddenly, there's a honk behind him. He turns to see a 
truck, PETE SAYER at the wheel.

		SAYER
Get in here old man.

Loomis walks over to the truck and gets in.

INT. TRUCK

A very old, beat up truck. Sayer is an old, eccentric man 
living in his own fantasy land.

		LOOMIS
Thank you.

					 	SAYER
Anything for a fellow pilgrim. Sometimes we need help 
getting where we want to be. (sneezes) Reverend Jackson 
Pete Sayer of Dumon County, please to make your aquanauts.
 

		LOOMIS
How far are you going, Mr. Sayer?

		SAYER
Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah

		LOOMIS
Loomis. Haddonfield.

		SAYER
Car trouble?

		LOOMIS
Sort of.

		SAYER
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, 
just like me.

		LOOMIS
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?

		SAYER
Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a 
face and a name. 

He takes a drink of the liquor.

Hunting the bastard for 30 years give or take. Come close a 
time or two. Too damn close. You can't kill damnation Mr. 
it don't die like a man dies.

		LOOMIS
I know that Mr. Sayer.

		SAYER
Oh your a pilgrim all right. I saw it on your face back 
there in the dust. I saw it clear as Breasts and blue suede 
shoes. Would you like a drink? (Hands Loomis the bottle who 
takes it.)

EXT. HADDONFIELD - NIGHT

It's Halloween night, and the children are out. But not all 
are collecting treats. A few KIDS throw toilet paper over a 
tree, then run away laughing.

INT. CORRUTHERS' HOUSE

Richard and Darlene are at the front door, getting ready to 
leave. Jamie is in the kitchen scraping off a plate.

		RICHARD
Okay Jamie, we're leaving. Where's Rach?

		JAMIE
I don't know.

Rachel comes into the living room.

		RACHEL
Here I am. 

		RICHARD					    
Come on, hon.

He takes Jamie's hand and leads her into the foyer. 

		DARLENE
How do we look?

		RACHEL
You guys always look great.

		DARLENE
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone. 

		RACHEL
I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and 
probably National Guard.

		RICHARD
I want you two to have fun tonight. Make sure Jamie's in 
bed by 9:30.

Rachel opens the door and her parents step outside.

MICHAEL'S POV - THROUGH BUSHES

Richard and Darlene are at the doorway.

		RACHEL
You're gonna be late. You don't want to blow your 
promotion.

		RICHARD
Don't make fun. Tonight is the difference between vacations 
in Bermuda, or spending another two weeks in Cleveland with 
your grandmother. 

		RACHEL
So hurry up.

		JAMIE
Bye. 

		RICHARD
See ya.

		RACHEL
Good luck, Dad. 

They leave. 

INT. LIVING ROOM

Jamie turns to Rachel, barely containing her excitement.

		JAMIE
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?

		RACHEL
Yeah, hurry up. 

Jamie hurries upstairs. Rachel makes sure she's upstairs, 
then walks into the living room.

MICHAEL'S POV - THROUGH WINDOW

Rachel walks into the living room. The POV walks past the 
brick wall to the other window. Rachel is sitting in a 
chair, phone to her head.

		RACHEL
Is Brady there?
(pause)
He's not back from work yet?
(pause)
Okay...Well when he comes in could you tell him to drop by 
at about eight. I should be home by then.
(pause)
This is Rachel. Okay, bye. 

Rachel hangs up, depressed. She calls up to Jamie.

		RACHEL
Come on Jamie, your gonna miss all the good Candy. 

INT. JAMIE'S ROOM

Jamie sits on her bed, clown costume on. She pulls on the 
small face mask, which looks like a dorkier version's of 
Robin's mask. 

EXT. CORRUTHERS' HOUSE - MICHAEL'S POV

Rachel gets up off the chair and moves out of our line of 
site.

		RACHEL
Come on Jamie. 

EXT. CORRUTHERS' HOUSE - FRONT LAWN

We see Jamie come running down the steps. She opens the 
front door.

		JAMIE
Come on Rachel!

		RACHEL
Coming.

		JAMIE
I thought you said you were ready.

		RACHEL
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.

They leave the house, Jamie excited. Rachel closes the 
door. And off they go.

INT. CORRUTHERS' HOUSE - MICHAEL'S POV

He's making his way upstairs. 

INT. JAMIE'S ROOM

The box full of pictures has been thrown down, all the 
pictures scattered. A burnt hand comes into view, and 
starts going through the pictures. They are pictures of 
Laurie and Jamie at an earlier age.

INT. POLICE STATION

Loomis comes in.

		LOOMIS
Ah, I need to speak with Sheriff Bracket.

HANK, the cop on duty, turns from his desk.

		HANK
Well then, you'll have to travel about 3 thousand miles 
south of here.

		LOOMIS
What?

		HANK
Bracket retired in '81. Went to St. Petersburg

		LOOMIS
Oh. Well, who's the new Sheriff?

BEN MEEKER, the new sheriff of Haddonfield, walks over to 
Loomis. He's a man in his early forties with an air of 
power. Not a man whom who should cross.

		MEEKER
I am. Ben Meeker.

		LOOMIS
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...

		MEEKER
					         (cuts him off) 
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your 
face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 
10 years?

		LOOMIS
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in 
Haddonfield.

		MEEKER
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.

		LOOMIS
He's here, Sheriff.

		MEEKER
Why?

		LOOMIS
10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he 
wants her daughter.

		MEEKER
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?

		LOOMIS
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.

		MEEKER
Myers has been locked up since before she was born. He's 
never laid eyes on her. 

He turns his back, and starts to move off.

		LOOMIS
Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here 
and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you 
Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that 
little girl and anybody that gets in his way. 

		MEEKER
Hank, call the troopers and check his story out. 
(to Loomis ) 
And assuming what you say is true..

		LOOMIS
Its true, Sheriff.

		MEEKER
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to 
avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?

		LOOMIS
Find this little girl, get her somewhere safe. Call the 
local T.V. station. Tell them to get people off the streets 
and behind locked doors.

		HANK
Can't get long distance, Sheriff. Operator says the lines 
are down.

		MEEKER
					           (to Loomis)
All right, lets go.

		LOOMIS
When he makes that call.

		MEEKER
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl. 

He and Loomis leave the station.

EXT. STREETS OF HADDONFIELD

Jamie is at a house, getting candy. 

		JAMIE
Thanks! 

She takes off to the next house. Rachel can hardly keep up.

		RACHEL
Jamie, wait for me.

		JAMIE
This is great Rachel. Come on. 

She takes off for the next house. Rachel is less than 
enthused. She slowly makes her way to the next house, a mob 
of kids running past her. Jamie is already at the next 
house. She knocks on the door. A WOMAN answers the door.

		JAMIE
Trick-or-treat.

		WOMAN
My what a cute little clown. Lets see what I have for you. 
There you are, sweetheart.

		JAMIE
Thank you.

		RACHEL
Thank you.

		WOMAN
You're welcome.

They get back on the sidewalk. 

		RACHEL
Had enough?

		JAMIE
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?

		RACHEL
Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock. 

They cross the street and meet a group of four kids, one of 
whom is the boy who teased Rachel.

		KID 1
Look, there's Jamie.

Jamie and Rachel stop. 

		KID 1
That clown costume is really cool.

		JAMIE
Really?

		KID 2
Yeah.

Nobody notices Michael, standing across the street, hidden 
in the shadows of the garage.

		KID 1
Hey wanna go with us?

Jamie looks to Rachel for permission.

		RACHEL
Go ahead.

The kids run to another house. It's a brick house with two 
stories, an attic, and a basement. The kids ring the 
doorbell. The door opens to reveal Kelly Meeker, wearing a 
long T-shirt that says, "Good cops do it by the book." She 
sees Rachel and glances back into the house.

		KELLY
Hi Rachel. 

		RACHEL
Hi.

Kelly starts to give the kids candy, a big smile on her 
face. Rachel glances back into the house and sees Brady 
come down the stairs. Rachel can't believe it. As the kids 
start to leave, Rachel turns in disgust and follows. Brady 
comes racing out of the house.

		BRADY
Rachel! Rachel!

Kelly stops him.

		KELLY
Brady!

		BRADY
Just a second.

He races off after Jamie.

		BRADY
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.

		RACHEL
You don't owe me anything.

Jamie walks on with the rest of the kids.

		KID
Hey Jamie come with us.

		JAMIE
Okay!

Jamie follows the other kids, leaving Rachel and Brady to 
argue.

		RACHEL
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.

		BRADY
No, you don't understand. 

He glances over at Kelly standing in the doorway.

		BRADY
I mean, you blew off our date at last minute. 

		RACHEL
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were 
different from other guys.

		BRADY
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed 
off...that's all.

		RACHEL
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. 
Hot panties. 

She starts to walk away.

		BRADY
Rachel!

But Rachel doesn't care.

		RACHEL
Jamie! 

Brady puts his hands behind his head and watches Rachel go. 
He messed up big time.

		KELLY
Brady, are you coming in or what?

Brady takes one more glance at Rachel then goes back 
inside. Rachel looks around for Jamie, but doesn't see her 
or the kids she was with.

		RACHEL
Jamie! Jamie! Great Rachel, just great.

INT. BAR

A very noisy bar, just like any other. A T.V. positioned 
behind the bar is turned on.

		REPORTER
By order of the Sheriff's office, all citizens of 
Haddonfield are asked to clear the streets.

EARL, the store's proprietor, watches the news.

		EARL
Everybody shut up a goddamn minute. Shut up!

		REPORTER
All businesses are asked to close as soon as possible.

		GUY
What's all that shot about, Earl? 

Earl picks up a phone and starts dialing the police station

		GUY
Not like 'ol Ben Meeker do something like that.

		EARL
Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd 
do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.

		GUY
Who you calling?

		EARL
Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good 
goddamn reason.

		GUY 2
Well?

		EARL
It just rang. 

He hangs up and takes a swig of a beer. Then he's off. He 
looks at the others.

		EARL
Well, come on. Jackie, watch the register for me, hun.

		JACKIE
You got it Earl.

As Earl and the other men leave, all the other people in 
the bar stop what they are doing and follow.

EXT. BAR

Earl and the other pile out of the bar.

		GUY
What's going down?

		GUY 2
Where are we going Earl?

		EARL
We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a 
police station.

		GUY
No way. No how.

		GUY 2
Wake up the Sheriff.

They all get in their trucks and rive off. A hillbilly mob.

INT. CORRUTHERS' HOUSE

The door opens and Meeker comes in, holding a shotgun. 
Loomis is right behind him. 

INT. JAMIE'S ROOM

The door opens and Loomis steps inside. He tries the light 
switch. Nothing. Loomis isn't surprised. He looks around. 
That's when he spots the pictures on the ground. He bends 
down and picks them up. As he does this, he notices 
something even worse. Meeker comes inside.


		MEEKER
Something?

		LOOMIS
He's been here.

		MEEKER
How do you know? 

Loomis looks at the closet. Meeker follows his gaze. In the 
closet is Sunday, dead.

		MEEKER
This is starting to spook me.

		LOOMIS
Least I'm not alone.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Meeker and Loomis come down the stairs. LOGAN, a deputy 
with blond hair in his late thirties, stands in the living 
room.

		MEEKER
Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets 
back.

		LOGAN
Right here, Ben.

		MEEKER
You look sharp. You understand?

		LOGAN
No problem, Sheriff.

Loomis and Meeker leave.

EXT. POWER PLANT

BUCKY, an electrician, opens a fuse box. He tries a fuse 
switches. Nothing. He pops a piece of gum in his mouth. He 
glances up, and sees Michael, standing behind his truck.

		BUCKY
Hey you! This is city property. No trespassing.

He walks over to Michael, who just stands there, bathed in 
darkness.

		BUCKY
What are you, deaf? Don't try that Halloween shit with me. 
All right, I'm on the telephone to the police right now. 
Don't you even think about leaving. 

He turns and begins to walk towards the phone. Michael 
begins following. Bucky turns and Michael grabs his shirt 
and belt, and throws him through the air. Bucky lands on a 
power unit, and sparks fly. The whole place buzzes while 
Bucky screams.

EXT. HOUSE

The lights go off.

EXT. POWER PLANT

Bucky continues to fry, while sparks shoot up into the air. 
Michael turns away.

EXT. HOUSE

The lights flicker, then go off.

EXT. POWER PLANT

A huge explosion rips the beams, and then all is quiet. 
Poor Bucky is fried to a crisp.

EXT. STREETS OF HADDONFIELD

The kids are still trick-or-treating, but their parents 
drive up in cars and collect them. The kids complain, but 
the parents are very firm.

Meanwhile, Rachel wanders the streets. She stops in the 
middle of a street.

		RACHEL
Jamie!

No response. Rachel begins walking.

MICHAEL'S POV - THROUGH BROKEN WINDOW

He is breathing heavily.

		RACHEL
Jamie!

ANGLE ON - RACHEL

She sighs and moves on.

EXT. HADDONFIELD STREET

Jamie is lost and alone, scared. She is in the bad part of 
town, and has no one to go to. Suddenly, a noise behind 
her. She turns around. A bush is moving. But is it the 
wind, or something far more sinister?

		JAMIE
Rachel? Is that you? Is that you?

Jamie turns away, very frightened. She starts walking. 
Behind her, on a porch, is a grinning jack-o-lantern.

EXT. STREET

Rachel is also scared, but trying not to show it.

		RACHEL
Jamie? Jamie!

She stops walking, and hears a branch snap behind her. She 
glances behind her. She sighs and starts walking again.

		RACHEL
Jamie?

She looks past a house into an alley. It's a dead end. 

		RACHEL
Jamie?

Rachel sighs. She could be anywhere. Rachel glances the 
other way and sees a dirt road. But that's not what 
attracts her attention. It's the man that does. His upper 
body is shrouded in smoke. He begins walking towards 
Rachel. She backs away and runs down the alley. She jumps 
onto the tire and grabs a hold of the fence. She begins to 
climb it, going as fast as she can. When she reaches the 
top she jumps down to the ground, and takes off running.

		RACHEL
Oh God!

She runs down an alley and jumps over a small fence 
separating two lawns. She runs onto the sidewalk.

		RACHEL
		 (scared)
Jamie.

She takes off running.

EXT. STREET

Jamie walks down a dark street. She hears rustling behind 
her. She turns around and looks behind her at all the trees 
and the old house. 

		JAMIE
Whoever you are, I have a really big dog with me and he 
bites.

In the background, Rachel comes running across a lawn. 
Jamie turns and sees Rachel. Rachel rushes over to Jamie.

		RACHEL
Jamie! Where have you been? Don't ever go off on your own 
at night again okay? Not ever. 

They hug, both glad for the company. Suddenly, headlights 
illuminate them. They look over to see a cop car. Meeker 
and Loomis get out.

		MEEKER
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!

		RACHEL
What's going on?

		LOOMIS
Get in the car. Come on, quick.

Rachel and Jamie hurry to the car and get in the back. 
Meeker makes his way over to the driver's side. Loomis is 
about to get in when he sees HIM. Michael, standing across 
the street, hidden behind a row of bushes. Meeker spots him 
too.

		MEEKER
Is that him? Is that him?

		LOOMIS
Yes.

Across the street behind Meeker another Michael appears. 
Meeker turns and spots him. Then a third Michael appears.

		MEEKER
Oh Christ. Doc...

		LOOMIS
Dear God. 

Loomis pulls out his gun. Which Michael is real. He takes 
aim and is about to fire when:

		BOY
				           (pulling off mask) 
Hey! Don't shoot!

The other two also pull of their masks, and run away, 
laughing and taunting.

		MEEKER
Get home dammit. There's a curfew. If I catch your asses, 
it'll be a weekend in jail. You all right Doc? Come on, 
we'll get to the station and get these kids safe.

In the car, Jamie begins to cry.

		RACHEL
Okay.

Meeker and Loomis get in the car and drive off.

		MEEKER
		  (on CB)
Come in Pierce.

Behind them stands the real Michael Myers, watching, 
waiting.

INT. POLICE STATION

The whole place has been wrecked. papers and equipment have 
been strewn about. Meeker and Loomis survey the 
destruction.

		MEEKER
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.

		LOOMIS
They didn't know what they were fighting.

Meeker makes his way deeper into the station. He stops when 
he spots Hank, stabbed and cut in so many places. He can't 
believe his eyes.

		MEEKER
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.

		LOOMIS
It isn't a man.

		MEEKER
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?

		LOOMIS
Evil.

With that, Loomis exits the police station.

EXT. POLICE STATION

Rachel and Jamie are still in the car, Jamie sleeping. The 
three trucks full of hill billies drive up, and Jamie wakes 
up. Meeker and Loomis come out of the police station as the 
hillbillies pile out of the trucks.

		EARL
What in Sam Hill is going on?

		MEEKER
Go on home Earl. It's police business.

		GUY
What the hell did this?

		EARL
Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some 
answers.

		MEEKER
I haven't got the time or the patience to argue with you. 
Now go home to your families where you belong. 

The men start talking and cause a big commotion. Loomis 
decides to end it.

		LOOMIS
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.

		MEEKER
Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.

		EARL
Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How 
many kids?

		GUY
Al here lost his boy 10 years back.

		AL
Well not this time, Ben. I'll handle this my own way. We're 
gonna fry his ass. 

The others agree and head for the trucks. Meeker turns on 
Loomis.

		MEEKER
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.

		LOOMIS
You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only 
defense you've got.

The men get in their trucks and drive off. Meeker watches 
them go.

		MEEKER
God help us.

EXT. CORRUTHERS' HOUSE

Logan runs out of the house, closing the door behind him. 
He runs to his car and climbs inside. He grabs his CB.

		LOGAN
132 to 133 this is 134.

		MEEKER
This is 132, over.

		LOGAN
Ben-uh-I just heard about the station.

The camera pans back to show Michael's burned hand 
clutching the backseat.

		MEEKER
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.

		LOGAN
I'll be there in 5 minutes. 

He starts the car and pulls out of the driveway. As his car 
speeds down the road, the Corruthers' car enters their 
driveway. Darlene gets out, afraid.

		DARLENE
Honey, I don't think their home.

		RICHARD
How do you know their not?

		DARLENE
Because the lights are all out.

		RICHARD
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet. 

		DARLENE
We should call the fire department.

		RICHARD
I'm not calling the fire department.

They run inside.

EXT. PARK

Earl's truck goes down the road. The hillbillies search.

		GUY
There he is...I've seen his face right there Al, in those 
bushes.

They all climb out of the truck and take aim at some 
bushes. The bushes move and all the hillbillies open fire. 
For what seems like hours the hillbillies shoot, until 
they're positive he's dead. They rush over to the bushes.

		GUY
Shit, Earl. It's Ted Holster.

		EARL
You dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw Myers.

INT. MEEKER'S HOUSE

Kelly and Brady are on the floor, making out. Brady slides 
Kelly's shirt up to reveal her panties. They're kissing 
passionately.

		KELLY
Lets go upstairs.

		BRADY
No, I think we're doing just fine here. 

Kelly takes off her shirt, revealing her bra.

		BRADY
Oh, I think I'm in Heaven. 

Kelly giggles. Brady takes off his shirt. Kelly slowly 
reaches behind her back and begins to remove it. She does 
it slowly, coyly. She slides one strap off, then the other. 
She hides her breasts and leans down, and Brady's hands are 
all over her. Suddenly, headlights appear on the wall.

		BRADY
Oh shit!

		KELLY
It's my dad!

		BRADY

Your dad? Your dad!!!

EXT. MEEKER'S HOUSE

The cop car pulls in the driveway.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Kelly and Brady are hastily getting dressed.

		KELLY
God, if he catches us like this he's going to skin you 
alive for starters.

		BRADY
What?

Kelly grabs her bra and stuffs it underneath a couch 
cushion.

		KELLY
Come on. Come on.

EXT. OUTSIDE

The foursome have piled out of the car and are headed 
towards the house.

		LOOMIS
Where's that Deputy?

		MEEKER
Be here in a minute.

They go inside. A few seconds later, Logan pulls up.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Brady sits down in a chair. Kelly tosses him a magazine. He 
pretends to read it. Meeker and the others come inside. 
Rachel sees Brady and knows exactly what happened.

		MEEKER
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.

		KELLY
Dad, what's going on?

		MEEKER
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs 
windows.

		KELLY
Why?

		MEEKER
Just do it.

		LOOMIS
Where's the radio?

		MEEKER
Right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs. 
(to Brady) 
Brady, you know how to use a gun?

		BRADY
Yes sir.

Meeker goes to the gun cabinet, and pulls out a shot gun, 
hands it to Brady.

		MEEKER
Think you can handle that?

		BRADY
Yeah, um, you want to tell me what's happening?

		MEEKER
Yeah, when I have time. 

Logan comes inside.

		MEEKER
You got your riot gun?

		LOGAN
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.

		MEEKER
Go get it. 

He grabs a box full of bullets and hands them to Brady.

		MEEKER
Take these. 

He then gives Brady the toolbox.

		MEEKER
Okay, you got a hammer and roofing nails. I want you up in 
the attic securing it so that nobody can get in.

		BRADY
You know, if something's happening, I should just go call 
my parents.

		MEEKER
Just get up in the attic. 

As Brady turns to go up to the attic, Meeker stops him.

		MEEKER
Oh yeah, I catch you groping my daughter I'll use that shot 
gun on you. You understand?

Brady nods and heads for the stairs, more than a little 
scared.

EXT. OUTSIDE/DRIVEWAY

Logan walks out to his car. He sees that the one of the 
back seat doors is open. He closes it, only a little 
worried. He goes to his trunk and opens it. He pulls out 
his riot gun and closes the trunk. He heads for the house. 

		MEEKER
Get the outside shutters.

		LOGAN
What are we doing?

		MEEKER
Making sure that no one can get in here.

		LOGAN
Isn't this all a little paranoid?

		MEEKER
If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.

INT. BEDROOM

Brady stops at the doorway and looks in at Rachel and 
Jamie.

		BRADY
Are you two okay?

		RACHEL
We've been better.

		BRADY
What's going on?

		RACHEL
Michael Myers.

		BRADY
Who's that?

		RACHEL
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.

		JAMIE
The kids at school were right.

		BRADY
Um, I'm gonna be outside, upstairs in the attic.

Logan is out fixing the shutters and Brady goes into the 
attic.

		KELLY
That's all the windows, Dad.

		MEEKER
All right. Good Good.  Logan I want you right here by the 
front door. This is the dead bolt key. 

He locks the door.

		MEEKER
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and 
out of this house. You got that?

		LOGAN
Got it Ben.

He turns to Kelly, who's just standing there.

		MEEKER
Why don't you go make some coffee.

		KELLY
All right.

INT. ATTIC

Brady is nailing a window shut. Suddenly, he hits his 
finger with a hammer.

		BRADY
Oh shit! 

He hears a noise coming from some dark corner of the attic.

		BRADY
Hello?...Who's there?

CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM

Jamie and Rachel lay on the bed, trying to go to sleep. But 
after all they've been through, it might be a while before 
either of them get a good nights rest.

		JAMIE
Can we go home soon Rachel?

		RACHEL
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.

INT. BASEMENT

Loomis and Meeker walk over to the radio. Meeker sits down 
in front of it.

		LOOMIS
How's it powered?

		MEEKER
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week.  
I wished I hadn't waited. 
(into radio) 
This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the 
state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me? 

He gets nothing but static, so he switches frequencies.

		MEEKER
Can anyone here me? 
(Static) 
Dammit.

INT. LIVING ROOM


Logan sits in the rocking chair, shotgun in his hands. He 
slowly rocks back and forth. Kelly is in the kitchen making 
coffee. Rachel comes down the stairs and walks over to 
Logan.

		LOGAN
Everything all right?

		RACHEL
Jamie's sleeping. When can we go home?

		LOGAN
State police will get here soon. Not long after that. Don't 
worry.

		RACHEL
I'm trying.

		LOGAN
It won't be long.

Myers face appears in the next room. You can barely see it, 
but Logan senses its presence and turns to look. But 
Michael has already disappeared from view.

INT. BASEMENT

Loomis and Meeker are listening to the radio, trying to 
contact help.

		LOOMIS
I hear someone.

		FRANK 
This is Frank Bute over in Tuckerville you got some kind of 
emergency?

		MEEKER
Oh Christ. This is Ben Meeker. Sheriff over in Haddonfield. 
Our phone and power lines are down and we have a killer 
running lose in the street. Michael Myers.

		FRANK
Is this some kind of Halloween prank?

		MEEKER
This is no joke. We need those troopers and we need them 
now.

		FRANK
All right. I'll get those troopers right away, hang on I'll 
need some information.

		MEEKER
I'm not going anywhere Mr. Bute.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Loomis comes up the stairs. He meets Rachel, who is just 
entering the living room. He inquires about Jamie.

		LOOMIS
Rachel, is your sister all right?

		RACHEL
She's fine.

		LOOMIS
Good. 
(to Logan) 
Sheriff's radioed for help. they'll be here soon.

		LOGAN
Hell of a night.

		LOOMIS
Its not over yet.

		LOGAN
Where are you going?

		LOOMIS
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's 
where he'll go.

		LOGAN
Leave Myers for the state boys.

		LOOMIS
The state police won't know how to stop him.

		LOGAN
Do you? 

		LOOMIS
Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.

Loomis leaves to go find Michael. Logan closes and locks 
the door.

INT. KITCHEN

Rachel goes into the kitchen and Kelly is searching for 
something. She's checking all the cabinets.

		RACHEL
Are you looking for this? 

She hands Kelly a pack of sugar. Kelly takes it and goes 
over to the coffee. Kelly seems sad. She tries to patch 
things up between her and Rachel.

		KELLY
I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?

		RACHEL
You knew. You just didn't care.

		KELLY
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's 
best for me.

		RACHEL
Don't you mean what you do best?

		KELLY
Wise up to what men want Rachel, or Brady won't be the last 
man you lose to another woman.

Rachel picks up a cup of coffee.

		RACHAEL
Have some coffee. 

She pours it all over Kelly's shirt. Kelly gasps, surprised 
at Rachel.

INT. BASEMENT

Meeker is listening to the radio. It suddenly comes alive 
with the hillbillies.

		MAN 1
Over at Alan gateways, shot Ted Holster by mistake.

		MAN 2
Well is he dead.

		MAN 1
Yeah, he's dead.

		MEEKER
Oh Christ.

Rachel comes down the stairs and stands behind him.

		MEEKER
04'd out there, this is Ben Meeker...Answer me dammit. 


All he gets is static. Nobody out there wants to take 
responsibility.

		RACHEL
Sheriff, what is going on out there?

		MEEKER
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys 
will send word once their in route. When that word comes 
you go tell deputy Logan.

		RACHEL
Okay.

		MEEKER
Now you understand?

		RACHEL
Uh huh.

Meeker heads for the stairs.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Meeker walks over to the door. Logan stands up. Meeker gets 
the key and starts unlocking the door.

		MEEKER
I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the 
troopers get here. 

		LOGAN
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.

		MEEKER
Hey. I got a town full of beer bellies running around in 
the dark with shotguns. Who's gonna be next? Somebody's 
wife? Somebody's kid? 

He cocks his gun.

		MEEKER
I can't stand by for that.

He opens the door and leaves. Logan closes the door, 
worried.

INT. BEDROOM

Jamie sits up in bed. She looks around, but doesn't see 
Rachel. She gets worried.

		JAMIE
Rachel?

INT. BASEMENT

Rachel is listening to the radio. She hears a creak behind 
her. 

INT. LIVING ROOM

Upstairs Kelly is done making coffee and brings it in to 
Logan.

		KELLY
I thought you might like some coffee. 

He continues to rock.

		KELLY
Pretty boring out here. I wish they'd fix the power. 

She sets the coffee down on the table. 

		KELLY
Least we'd have some MTV while we wait for the calvary.

She picks up some matches and lights one. Carefully, so not 
to extinguish the flame, she lights the candle. And she 
screams. Logan's dead body is in the corner, blood 
splattered on his face. Kelly turns to the man in the 
chair. He stands up and turns to her.

It's MICHAEL!

He slowly advances for her. Kelly screams and backs up. 
Michael brings the shotgun back and rams it right through 
Kelly, lifting her up and ramming her against the wall. The 
shotgun enters the wall, pinning Kelly's lifeless body 
against it.

INT. BASEMENT

Rachel is listening to the radio. It suddenly crackles and 
Frank Bute comes on.

		FRANK
Haddonfield, we should have cars dispatched in 5 minutes. 
ETA 35 minutes, Over. 

Rachel grabs the mike and brings it up to her face.

		RACHEL
Ah, okay, great. We'll be waiting.

		FRANK
Ah ten-four over.

		RACHEL
Ah, over and out.

Rachel puts the mike down and heads for the stairs. She 
looks behind her one last time to make sure Frank doesn't 
decide to speak again. Then she goes up the stairs.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Rachel looks around. Logan's rocking chair is empty. She 
isn't bothered by this and shouts.

		RACHEL
Deputy Logan? 

When she receives no reply, Rachel's happy demeanor 
evaporates.

		RACHEL
Deputy? 

She looks around and sees Deputy Logan's bloodied corpse by 
the table. She turns and sees Kelly's lifeless corpse 
dangling from the wall. 

		RACHEL
Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!

She heads for the stairs.

		RACHEL
Jamie!!! Jamie!!

She starts up the stairs but trips. She quickly gets up and 
sprints the rest of the way up. She reaches the door to the 
bedroom and looks inside. 

JAMIE'S GONE!

		RACHEL
Oh God! Oh God!

Rachel goes hysterical. She runs down the stairs and bumps 
into Brady.

		BRADY
What the hell is going on?

Rachel starts back up the stairs.

		RACHEL
I've gotta find Jamie.

Brady grabs her and starts pulling her toward the door.

		BRADY
No, no, we have to get out of here right now.

		RACHEL
Not without Jamie.

		BRADY
Look. 

He point to Logan's corpse.

		BRADY
You think she stands a chance?

		RACHEL
She's not dead!

Brady rushes over to the door and tries to open it. But 
it's locked and the key is nowhere to be found.

		BRADY
Is there another key?

		RACHEL
I don't know!

Brady rushes over to Rachel.

		BRADY
Get out of the way, get out of the way. 

He raises the shotgun and shoots the door twice. He rushes 
over to the door. He touches the knob but pulls it away 
quickly. He goes back over to Rachel.

		BRADY
Its metal, god dammit its metal.

		RACHEL
What does that mean?

		BRADY
We're trapped in this house.

They start up the stairs. Rachel looks up and sees Jamie 
come out of a door.

		RACHEL
Jamie!

		JAMIE
Oh Rachel! 

Rachael runs up the stairs to Jamie and hugs her.

		BRADY
Rachel!

Rachel releases Jamie and runs to the stairs. She looks 
down.

Michael is in the living room, standing behind the 
fireplace.

		RACHEL
Brady!

		BRADY
Get back!

		RACHEL
Brady!

		BRADY
No. You son of a bitch!

Brady aims the gun at Michael, who is slowly walking up the 
steps. He pulls the trigger. Nothing happens. No bullet 
comes out.

		BRADY
Shit!

		RACHEL
Brady! Come with us.

		BRADY
Go!

		RACHEL
Brady!

		BRADY
Get up there Rachel! 

Brady fumbles with the bullets, not able to get them in the 
shotgun.

		BRADY
Shit!

Michael continues climbing the stairs, with each step 
getting closer...

		RACHEL
Brady!

		BRADY
Get up there Rachel!

		RACHEL
Brady! Come with us! Brady!

		BRADY
Go!

Brady has one bullet in, he tries to hurriedly put in 
another.

		RACHEL & JAMIE
Brady!

		BRADY
Go! 

Brady puts the bullet in and snaps the chamber closed. He 
turns to aim, but Michael is already upon him. Michael 
grabs Brady by the shoulders. Brady fires, but the shot 
goes wide and hits the wall. Michael throws Brady against 
the wall. He hits hard and slumps down. Jamie tries to pull 
Rachel away. 

		JAMIE
Rachel come on.

		RACHEL
No.

		JAMIE
Come on. 

Brady looks up at Rachel. 

		BRADY
Shit.

He grabs the shotgun and stands up. He hits Michael on the 
head with the butt of the gun. He swings again but Michael 
grabs the gun. They struggle for a second before Michael 
slams it into Brady's face. Brady falls back onto the 
floor. Michael tosses the gun over the railing. It lands 
with a thud on the living room floor. 

Brady stands up and walks over to Michael. His nose is 
bleeding. He rears back his hand and punches Michael right 
in the face. Brady pulls back his arm and takes another 
swing, but Michael grabs it. He pulls back and we hear 
bones crunching. Brady screams in agony. With his other 
hand, Michael grabs Brady's throat and starts to lift him 
off the floor... 

Michael releases Brady's hand and wraps his other hand 
around Brady's throat. Brady tries to spit in Michael's 
face, but he misses and it lands off to the side. Michael 
starts pushing his finger into Brady's cheek. Brady screams 
in agony. Michael's finger digs deeper into Brady's cheek. 
We hear a crunching sound. 

INT. ATTIC

Rachel and Jamie stop at the platform to the attic. Rachel 
looks back and shouts.

		RACHEL
Leave us alone, just leave us alone.  

They run up the rest of the stairs. Rachel looks around and 
sees a suitcase.

		RACHEL
Jamie!

Rachel throws the suitcase onto the platform. Jamie grabs 
something and throws it down too. They continue picking up 
items and throwing them onto the platform until it's 
cluttered with junk. Rachel grabs Jamie and moves her 
farther into the attic.

Michael reaches the platform, but he's blocked by all the 
junk.

Jamie lets out a small gasp when she hears Michael. Rachel 
looks around. She starts pushing Jamie in a certain 
direction.

		RACHEL
Go! Go!

Michael is starting to clear a path through all the stuff 
in his way...

		RACHEL
Come on! Come on!

Michael has cleared a path and starts walking up the very 
few steps that are left...

Rachel and Jamie come to a window, but it's locked.

		JAMIE
Rachel! 

Michael stops for a second. He notices a tin can full of 
knives. He grabs the biggest, sharpest one and continues 
toward Jamie and Rachel...

		RACHEL
Jamie, get down. Get down. 

Rachel grabs a suitcase and uses it to smash out the 
window. She throws the suitcase out onto the roof and bends 
down.


		RACHEL
Get on my back Jamie. Get on, hold on.

Jamie climbs onto Rachel's back. Very carefully, Rachel 
steps out of the window and onto the roof.

EXT. OUTSIDE/ROOF

Rachel looks down and sees how far she is to the ground. If 
they fall and hit the pavement, they're dead. She grabs 
onto a pipe jutting up from the roof and uses it to pulls 
herself up. Slowly, she moves her way up the roof. Every 
few seconds Jamie looks behind them to see if Michael is 
following.

Rachel reaches the very top of the roof. She tries to reach 
for the arched part of the roof, but misses. She tries 
again, but still doesn't make it. As she reaches out again, 
a shingle her foot was on comes loose and they go sliding 
back down the roof. Rachel grabs onto the pipe to stop her 
descent. Jamie starts to slide off her back. Rachel grabs 
her and pulls her up.

		RACHEL
Grab on, Jamie.

Jamie gets onto Rachel's back. Rachel starts up the roof 
once again. This time, she grabs a black cord to steady 
her. Jamie gets off Rachel's back and looks behind them. 
She screams.

Michael is pulling himself up onto the roof. Rachel grabs 
Jamie, and, using the cord, climbs over to the far side of 
the roof. Rachel lifts Jamie up and over. 

		RACHEL
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?

		JAMIE
I can't.

		RACHEL
Well try dammit!

She starts to lower Jamie. Suddenly, Michael appears!

		JAMIE
Rachel! 

Jamie slips and slides down to the chimney. Rachel looks 
behind her and takes a swipe at her with his knife. Rachel 
barely dodges. By this time, Jamie is already to the 
chimney. Michael takes another swipe at Rachel. Rachel 
rolls down the roof and hits the chimney. She gets up and 
faces Jamie. She gets the cord and ties it around Jamie. 

		RACHEL
I'm gonna lower you down Jamie okay? 

Jamie climbs over the edge. 

		JAMIE
Rachel!

		RACHEL
I've got you come on, go down.

		JAMIE
Rachel!

		Rachel
I've got you Jamie. 


She starts to slowly lower Jamie down the side of the 
house. 

		JAMIE
I've got you, I've got you. 

Jamie is dangling above the ground, her clown mask pushed 
to the side of her neck. She struggles, her legs flailing 
in the air.

Rachel continues to lower Jamie when Michael suddenly 
appears! She lets go of the cable, making Jamie drop about 
halfway down. Rachel rolls out of the way as Michael takes 
a swipe at her with his knife. He places his hand on the 
chimney for support. He again takes a swipe at Rachel, 
causing her to roll to the edge of the roof.

Michael slowly heads for her. Rachel dangles above the 
ground, her hands holding onto the roof for dear life. She 
starts to slowly move to the side, away from Michael. 

Jamie grabs onto the ledge of the house and hoists herself 
onto it.

Michael swings his knife at Rachel, causing her to lose her 
grip. She plummets to the ground.

		RACHEL
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!

THUD! Michael stands there, breathing heavily, just staring 
at Rachel's unmoving body.

CUT TO:

Jamie climbs the rest of the way down and runs over to 
Rachel. 

		JAMIE
					           (crying) 
Oh please come alive Rachel, please come alive. You can't 
be dead. Come alive Rachel!

Jamie lays her head on Rachel's shoulder and begins 
sobbing. Michael appears at the side of the house. Jamie 
glances over at him, then at Rachel. She looks back at 
Michael and begins to run. 

		JAMIE
Help! Please, somebody help me! Help! Please! Somebody help 
me!

Jamie runs by house after house, calling for help. She 
looks behind her, sees Michael appear from behind a bush, 
and runs faster. She trips, gets back up, and continues 
running.

CUT TO:

Rachel, laying on the ground. She moves slightly.

CUT TO:

Jamie. She's no longer running. She's walking slowly, 
looking around. Suddenly, she sees something off screen and 
begins running. But, before she gets anywhere, she runs 
into Dr. Loomis. He grabs her, tries to comfort her.

		LOOMIS
What are you doing out here alone?

		JAMIE
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home. 

		LOOMIS
Oh no you can't. I've just been there. That's the first 
place he'll look for you. Where's the school house? Where 
is the school house? 


		JAMIE
It's over there.

She points to somewhere behind Loomis.
 

		LOOMIS
Come on. Come we'll be safe there. 

EXT. SCHOOL

Dr. Loomis and Jamie walk over to the doors. Loomis grabs 
Jamie and holds her tight as he raises his gun and fires 
four times at the door. He and Jamie walk up the steps. 
When he opens the door, the alarms go off. Dr. Loomis and 
Jamie enter the school, closing the door behind them.

INT. SCHOOL

Loomis and Jamie walk up the steps. Loomis tries the first 
door he comes across, but it's locked.

		LOOMIS
We'll hear sirens soon.

		JAMIE
Then we'll be safe?

		LOOMIS
Yeah. 

He tries another door, but it's locked too.

		JAMIE
You don't believe that do you?

		LOOMIS
No. 

They hug. Loomis turns to leave when Michael appears, 
grabbing Loomis and throwing him through a door, breaking 
the glass and the door. Jamie screams and runs down the 
hall, trying to open the doors. She comes to the last door 
and tries to open it, but it's locked. She pounds on it.

		JAMIE
Oh, oh. Somebody help me!

She walks over to the end of the hall and crouches, putting 
her arms over her face.

		JAMIE
No.

She begins sobbing. When nothing happens, she looks down 
the hall. There's no sign of Michael. Jamie slowly stands 
up. She looks around her, not believing that Michael is 
really gone. She starts to slowly walk down the hall, 
peering into every corner, every dark room. Michael could 
be anywhere. She comes to split in the hallway. On one 
side, stairs leading down to an entrance and another 
hallway. On the other, stairs leading to the second floor.

		JAMIE
Ahhhhhhhhh!

Michael stands on the steps, knife in hand. Jamie begins to 
run down the other steps but she trips and tumbles down the 
steps, landing with a soft thud. She looks up at the top of 
the stairs and she sees Michael begin to slowly descend 
them. Jamie starts to crawl away, but Michael's hand grabs 
her leg, pulling her back. She screams just as

RACHEL APPEARS,

a fire extinguisher in her hand. She begins to spray 
Michael with it. He is instantly covered in smoke. He holds 
his hands up, trying to ward it off. Rachel continues 
spraying Michael.

EXT. SCHOOL

A truck with Earl, Al and two other hillbillies comes down 
the road. One guy bangs on the roof to get Earl's 
attention.

		GUY
In the school. Pull over Earl. 

They pull up to the school. They all pile out of the truck 
when Rachel comes out, carrying Jamie. They rush over to 
her. 

		EARL
What's going on here? We heard the alarm.

		RACHEL
He's inside.

		GUY
Jesus. Where?

		RACHEL
In the school. 

INT. SCHOOL

Michael is gone...

EXT. SCHOOL

They all discuss what to do.

		GUY
Let's get this bastard.

		JAMIE
No! He'll kill you too.

		RACHEL
We have to get out of Haddonfield, the state police at on 
their way let them handle it.

		GUY
I don't know about you Earl, but that makes sense to me. 
Lets get the hell out.

		AL
He's not our patient. Let the troopers have him. That's 
what they get paid for.

		GUY
Screw it. Lets get out of here. Al.

Al takes Jamie from Rachel while the others pile into the 
truck. Al opens the passenger side door and put Jamie down 
next to Earl.

EXT. ROAD

The truck flies along the road, the hillbillies lights 
shining into the night. They pass a sign saying "WELCOME TO 
HADDONFIELD. HOME OF THE HUSKERS."

INT. TRUCK

Jamie sits in Rachel's lap, both tired and hungry. Earl 
glances at them, then back at the road.

EXT. TRUCK

Two hillbillies have their guns and lights propped up on 
the roof of the truck, keeping an eye out. Al sits by the 
tailgate.


INT. TRUCK

Earl reaches for the CB. He talks into it.

		EARL
					      (into radio) 
Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and 
her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town 
route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?

		GUY
					    (Through radio) 
Got it Earl.

		EARL
Okay, out. 

EXT. ROAD

A long line of cop cars comes speeding down the road, 
sirens blazing.

INT. TRUCK

Rachel looks at Jamie, happy to have her safe. Earl looks 
out the front window and sees the long line of cop cars. He 
turns to Rachel.

		EARL
Here comes the calvary now. 

EXT. TRUCK

One hillbilly swings his flashlight back and forth while 
the other fires his shotgun into the night. All the cars go 
by except one. It stops and waits for Earl to pull up. The 
COP gets out of his car.

		COP
Coming outta Haddonfield?

		EARL
Yeah right outta the elementary school, taking these kids 
to safety.

		COP
Okay, there's a highway patrol substation about 4 miles 
down the highway. You'll see the turnoff signs. Now we've 
got officers on duty, they'll take care of you.

		EARL
Thanks. 

Earl puts his foot on the gas and drives away.

INT. TRUCK

Earl looks over at Rachel and Jamie.

		EARL
You'll be okay. 

Rachel tries to manage a smile.

EXT. TRUCK

Al sits near the tailgate, watching the road behind them. 
The other two hillbillies keep their eyes on the road ahead 
of them.

INT. TRUCK

POV

We are seeing from behind Earl. The road ahead is foggy and 
nothing is certain.

EXT. TRUCK

CLOSE ON:

The tailgate. Suddenly, Michael's hand appear, then the 
other one with the knife. He begins to haul himself up into 
the bed of the truck. None of them notice Michael until 
it's too late. One hillbilly turns, and tries to hit 
Michael with his shotgun, but Michael grabs it and stabs 
him in the back with the knife.

Michael throws his body down just as Al gets up. Michael 
stabs him in the side, and throws his body against the 
tailgate. The tailgate busts open and Al's and the 
hillbilly's bodies go tumbling off the truck and onto the 
road.

INT. TRUCK

Rachel, Earl, and Jamie are completely oblivious to what's 
happening to the three hillbillies.

EXT. TRUCK

Michael throws the last hillbilly off of the truck. He goes 
rolling down the hill.

INT. TRUCK

Earl is getting nervous. He heard some noises. He looks out 
the back window when

MICHAEL'S HAND BREAKS THROUGH THE DRIVERS SIDE WINDOW

and latch on to Earl's neck. His fingers dig deep into 
Earl's neck, drawing blood. Jamie and Rachel scream as 
Michael twists Earl's neck open.

EXT. ROAD

The truck swerves dangerously, Michael on the roof.

INT. TRUCK

Jamie falls into the floorboard, screaming. Rachel pushes 
Earl's body aside and gets behind the wheel.

EXT. TRUCK

It swerves, Michael still clinging to the top.

INT. TRUCK

Rachel opens the door and pushes Earl's body out.

EXT. TRUCK

Earl's lifeless body flies out of the truck and rolls down 
the hill.

INT. TRUCK

Rachel reaches over to the door and closes it. Jamie still 
hides in the floorboards.

EXT. TRUCK

Michael swings his hand inside the truck, trying to grab 
Rachel. She whips the wheel this way and that, trying to 
make Michael fall off.

INT. TRUCK

Michael's hand swings into the truck. Rachel tries to avoid 
it while maintaining control over the truck.

EXT. TRUCK

Michael swerves from side to side, barely hanging on.

INT. TRUCK

Rachel jerks the wheel to the right.

EXT. TRUCK

Michael almost falls off, but he manages to keep his grip.

INT. TRUCK

Rachel jerks the wheel, causing Jamie to fall into the 
floorboard and hit her head.

		RACHEL
Jamie!

Rachel continues to jerk the wheel.

EXT. TRUCK

It moves to the right, then the left. Michael's body is 
thrown every which way.

INT. TRUCK

Michael's hand reaches into the truck and grabs hold of 
Rachel's sweater. Rachel fights free, but Michael rips her 
sweater. She screams.

EXT. TRUCK

It swerves all over the road.

INT. TRUCK

Michael's face smashes into the front windshield. Rachel 
screams and pushes down on the brakes. Jamie falls back 
into the floorboards.

EXT. TRUCK

Michael goes flying off the truck. He rolls onto the road.

INT. TRUCK

Jamie slowly peeks over the seat. Rachel looks out the 
window and sees Michael slowly stand up. She messes with 
the gear shift.

		RACHEL
Die you son of a bitch. 

She steps on the gas, and the truck goes forward at a fast 
rate, knocking into Michael. He goes flying into the air 
and lands on the ground near a mine. The truck rolls down 
the hill.

INT. TRUCK

Rachel presses the brakes, praying that the truck will 
stop.

EXT. TRUCK

The truck comes to a stop. Through the window we see Rachel 
sigh.

EXT. ROAD

The police cars comes speeding down the road, heading for 
Rachel and Jamie.

CLOSE ON:

Michael's hand. It still has a grip on the knife. Slowly, 
the grip loosens.

INT. TRUCK

Jamie stares at Michael, fascinated.

		RACHEL
Jamie, I want you to stay right here in the truck. 

EXT. ROAD

Meeker is the first one to arrive. Rachel races over to 
him.

		RACHEL
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.

		MEEKER
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right? 

Rachel nods.

		MEEKER
Where's Jamie? 

CUT TO:

Jamie. She kneels down beside Michael. She takes his hand 
and holds it, looking at the scars caused by the fire.

		MEEKER
Jamie! Get away!

		RACHEL
Don't touch him Jamie!

Jamie drops his hand and turns to them.


CLOSE ON:

Michael's hand. It grabs the knife.

NORMAL VIEW

Michael sits up.

		MEEKER
Get down!

Jamie jumps to the ground just as Michael gets to his feet. 
Meeker pulls the trigger on his shotgun and BAM! a bullet 
hits Michael dead on. He's knocked back. The other cops and 
hillbillies open fire, creating a dazzling display of 
light. Bullet after bullet slams into Michael, causing him 
to step back. A few bullets hit the ground around Michael, 
but most hit home. Rachel covers her ears as the sounds of 
bullets being fired echoes all around her. Meeker takes 
aim, and fires, his bullet knocking Michael back. More and 
more bullets rain down on Michael, causing one of the most 
terrifying killers ever to stumble backwards, until he 
slips and falls down an abandoned mine shaft, hopefully to 
his death.

The guns go quiet as everybody realizes that Michael is 
gone. Meeker breaths deeply, satisfied. No human could have 
survived that onslaught of bullets. No one. Wood and dirt 
crumble into the mine, burying Michael. 

EXT. CORRUTHERS' HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

Everything is quiet. Peaceful. 

INT. LIVING ROOM

Richard and Darlene hug Jamie and Rachel when they walk in, 
escorted by Meeker.

		RICHARD
Oh, babies.

Meeker walks over to the front door and opens it. Loomis 
limps in.

		MEEKER
It's over.

		LOOMIS
Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.

Meeker sits down in a chair.

		MEEKER
These kids aren't likely to forget.

		LOOMIS
They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.

Rachel is completely exhausted, dried blood caked to her 
face.

		DARLENE
I'm going to take Jamie upstairs. 

She puts her hand on Richard's knee.

		DARLENE
		   (cont'd)
Stay with Rachel. 
(to Jamie)
Come on honey.

Darlene turns on the water, letting it fill the tub.

INT. HALLWAY

POV

The person looks at a darkened room, then down the hall. It 
turns right and looks into a small bathroom. A pair of 
scissors lays on the sink. They're picked up by someone off 
screen. The POV returns to the hallway.

INT. BATHROOM

The tub is halfway full. Darlene, in a robe, lays two 
towels down on the edge  of the tub.

INT. HALLWAY

POV

Suddenly, a mask slides onto the person's face. We are now 
only seeing through the two eye holes. We make our way to 
the end of the hall. We turn, and stare at Darlene, hunched 
over the tub. She looks over at the person.

Ahhhhhhhh!!!

Loomis comes hobbling up the steps, then stops.

No. No!

Jamie stands at the top of the stairs, a bloody pair of 
scissors held in her hand. Her costume is flecked with 
blood...

No! No! No! No!

He raises his gun to shoot her.

		LOOMIS
No!

Suddenly, Meeker jumps at him, knocking the gun out of his 
hand. Loomis falls to the ground, sobbing. Meeker grabs his 
gun and points it, but can only stare when he sees that 
it's Jamie. Richard comes up the stairs, quickly followed 
by Rachel. They both stop, stunned.

CLOSE ON:

Jamie. She raises the scissors into the air.

CUT TO BLACK!!!!

	BEGIN MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE

	EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSING DEVELOPMENT - DAY

	A big, yellow SCHOOL BUS pulls up to a corner and discharges a 
	group of TEENAGERS.  It's one of those fantastic spring afternoons 
	and the kids take to their freedom like they were just sprung from 
	Leavenworth.

						KIDS
			G'night, Joe...Have a good weekend, etc.

	The BUS DRIVER doesn't answer but nods and smiles as they deboard.  
	He is a pleasant looking elderly man, wearing a khaki work shirt, 
	a matching cap and chewing on an unlit, twenty-five cent stogie.

	The DOORS fold shut, the GEARS GRIND and the bus continues along 
	its route.

	INT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY

	While there are only about a dozen kids on the bus, the noise 
	level is deafening.  GIRLS are yapping, GUYS are horsing around, 
	someone is fiddling with a ghetto-blaster, trying to decide among 
	several loud stations.

	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

	The bus turns a corner, taking them out of the development and 
	past some older, less identical looking residences spaced more 
	widely apart.

	INT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY

	The Driver downshifts the old heap, pulls the wheel over to the 
	curb and reaches over to push the door lever open.

	KIDS file out down he aisle, some of them wishing him well as they 
	leave.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as the gears grind again and the bus pulls away.  We see that 
	there are only a few KIDS remaining:  TWO GIRLS sit together 
	toward the center and a lone, nerdy-looking BOY sits at the rear.

	The DRIVER is in front of an aluminum divider and, except for the 
	top of his cap, cannot be seen.

	END MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE

	ON THE THREE KIDS

	The two girls are pretty, teen-fashionable and just a little 
	immature.  One of them turns back to look over her shoulder.

	CLOSER ANGLE - THE BOY

	Poor kid.  About 17, four-eyes, bad skin, lousy posture and an 
	obvious inferiority complex.  He's sweating profussely and he 
	stands slightly to unlatch and lower the window.  He pulls down on 
	it with all his strength but it is hopelessly stuck.

	He sits back down and sighs.  Suddenly, he feels the girl's stare.  
	he doesn't turn but sends his eyes over to see who's goggling at 
	him.

	ON GIRLS - JESSE'S POV

	The first girl turns back to her friend to whisper something.  The 
	friend turns around to see for herself.

	INT. BUS

	The boy stares forward now and catches her glance directly.

	The girls shift quickly in their seats to face forard and let out 
	with an uncontrollable rush of mean giggles.

	The boy is clearly embarrassed now and looks down at the books in 
	his lap.

	We hear the engine REVVING - the bus seems to be picking up speed.

	One of the girls stands, ready to get off.

	GIRL'S POV OUT WINDOW: EXT. STREET

	A MOTHER, her PRE-SCHOOL CHILD on a TRICYCLE and their DOG wait 
	for the bus to discharge the girl.

	EXT. STREET

	The bus speeds past the waiting group, to their amazement.

	INT. BUS

	The standind girl's jaw drops open as they shoot by a familiar 
	looking intersection and continue to pick up speed.

						FIRST GIRL
					(to her friend)
			Hey!
					(calling to driver)
			Hey, that war our stop!

	The bus turns a sharp corner and the first girl almost falls.  The 
	second girl grips onto the seatback and lifts herself to her feet.

						SECOND GIRL
					(calling to the driver)
			Hey, Joe!  Our stop!

	HER POV - THE FRONT OF THE BUS

	The unseen driver ignores the calls and continues picking up 
	speed.  We might notice that his hat has changed; in place of the 
	cap, we can see the top of a BATTERED OLD FEDORA.

						SECOND GIRL (O.C.)
			Hey, let us off!

	EXT. TWO-LANE STREET - DAY

	The sky has suddenly turned; a wave of threatening clouds sweeps 
	overhead and the WIND is churning a planting of roadside weeping 
	willows into a tangled mess of yellow tendrils.

	The bus WHINES near the top end of third, all of its FLASHERS are 
	going like the dashboard was having a major coronary.  It passes 
	the last house and heads into open terrain.

	IN THE BUS

	THE SECOND GIRL steps into the aisle and starts making her way 
	toward the front of the coach.

						SECOND GIRL
					(under her breath)
			Deaf old fart...

	She stops suddenly and GASPS as she watches

	THE DRIVER'S ARM

	emerge to throw the floorshift into fourth.  His hand is clad in a 
	strange GLOVE that tip his fingers with a menacing set of RAZOR-
	SHARP, STEEL TALONS.  His sleeve is charred and smoking.

	The bus SWERVES WILDLY as it skids around a corner, throwing its 
	few passengers into collision courses with the walls and each 
	other.

	A FLASH OF LIGHTNING crashes through the air.

	EXT. DESERT LANDSCAPE

	As the lightning subsides, the sky is dark.  The BUS SCREAMS 
	along, banging through rocks and ditches, CRASHING through a wall 
	of overgrown brambles.  Thick clouds of steam pour out from under 
	he hood and stream back along toward the rear of the vehicle.

	ON THE BOY

	holding o to his seatback and watching out the window in terror as 
	trees TEAR loose from the ground i the bus'wake.

	We hear a LOUD RUMBLING and the bus begins to shake as if the 
	planet itself is splitting in two.

	ON THE BUS

	Skidding across the desert landscape, being THROWN to and fro 
	laterally, at the mercy of the shuddering landscape.

	ON A FRONT WHEEL

	as the tire smacks into a jagged boulder, SNAPPING the wheel from 
	its axle.

	ON THE FRONT END

	BOUNCING to a violent halt, the bumer digging a long trench into 
	the earth.

	IN THE BUS

	THE KIDS pick themselves up from the floor.  It is very hot and 
	smoky inside.  They have moved closer together now, sweating, 
	scared. Frantically, the boy tries to open a window, but it will 
	not budge.

	He looks out the window and gasps.

	EXT. POV FROM WINDOW

	THE GROUND below begins to SPLIT apart and tumble into a deep 
	fissure that is encirling the bus.

	ON THE MOOR, THE BUS CENTER

	The land is IMPLODING all around it; huge chunks of the earth's 
	crust are shearing themselves loose from the edges of the fissure 
	and tumbling into oblivion.

	In moments, the bus is stranded on the narrow tip of a towering 
	ridge of crumbling stone.

	The bus teeters precariously, tasting the smoky abyss in every 
	direction.

	INSIDE

	THE SECOND GIRL is on al fours in the aisle.  She looks up toward 
	the driver's seat.

						SECOND GIRL
					(seeing something
					 hideous)
			Jesus!

	She scrambles to her feet and begins backing off.  The floor of 
	the bus shifts dangerously, throwing the girl into the edge of one 
	of the seats.

	ON THE DRIVER

	as he makes his way toward the back.  We don'g see his face but he 
	is dressed in a filthy green and red sweater.  In the B.G., the 
	dashboard instruments are sparking and sending thick black fumes 
	toward the ceiling.  SMOKE is rising off his body as if he just 
	stepped out of some horrible fire.  A small patch of skin on his 
	hand sizzles and pops and drips a molten glob of flesh that burns 
	a small hole in a seat cushion.

	His Razor-Talons sweep along the tops of the seat-backs CUTTING 
	deep gashes into the green vinyl upholstery and SCRAPING horribly 
	over the tubular steel support poles.

	ON THE BOY

	Terrified.  Lookign first at the awful talons, then out the window 
	at the DEADLY DROP and back at the bus driver.

	ON THE GIRLS

	Sweating, panicking.  They back away, going from window to window, 
	trying desperately to pull them down.  They're all locked tight.  
	One reaches for the emergence door leer at the rear of the bus.  
	It comes off in her hand.

	The kids huddle together, petrified, screaming, as the driver is 
	upon her.

	CU: DRIVER

	He lifts the awful, talonned glove in f.g.  Behind, obscured by 
	smoke, we see, for an instant, his fce -- the face of FREDDY.  he 
	raises his weapon arm higher and STRIKES.

									     SMASH CUT TO:

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

	CLOSE on a steel blade cutting into red flesh.  We PULL BACK and 
	see that it is MOM, slicing a tomato at the kitchen counter.

	This is an all-American family; along with a MOM, there's a DAD 
	and a kid sister named NGELA and they ll are having breakfast 
	together.

	A moment later, there is a muffled, OFF-CAMERA SCREAM.  Mom looks 
	up.  We can also make out the RINGING of an alarm clock in another 
	part of the house.

	ANGELA jumps slightly at the scream.  She's a pretty little 
	eleven-year old, genuinely cute, not precocious.

						ANGELA
					(to Mom)
			Why can't Jesse wake up like every-
			body else?

						MOM
					(hushed)
			Shhh.  He must've had another night-
			mare.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - JESSE'S ROOM - MORNING

	ON JESSE'S BED. An alarm clock RINGS LOUDLY.

	JESSE WALSH (17) is sitting up in bed.  He's sweaty and scared and 
	disoriented as he slams his hand down on the alarm and tries to 
	shake the nightmare out of his head.

	We see that he's the boy on the bus only he's not half-bad looking 
	- far from nerdy.  he has no skin problems and he doesn't wear 
	glasses and his body's in good shape.

	As he gets out of bed, still shaky from the dream, and we see that 
	his bedroom is littered with cardboard cartons - most of them open 
	and half-empty.  He trips over a carton on his way to his jeans.

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

	Mom is at the stove cooking eggs for her family.  She looks up, 
	worried, as Jesse comes in and heads for the refrigerator.

						JESSE
					(mumbles)
			'Morning.

						MOM
					(putting on a smile)
			'Morning, honey.

	Jesse pours himself a GLASS OF MILK from the fridge.  He joins Dad 
	and Angela family at the breakfast table.

						DAD
			You got your room straightened out
			yet?

						JESSE
					(yawns)
			It's getting there.

						DAD
			We've only been living here six weeks
			now.  I want that room unpacked by
			tonight.

	MOM comes over with some eggs for Dad.

						MOM
					(to Jesse)
			Want some eggs...Angela, what are you
			doing?

	ON ANGELA

	She is struggling to put her hand deep into a box of FU-MAN CHEWS 
	breakfast cereal.

						ANGELA
					(frustrated)
			I'm trying to get the Fu-Man Fingers!

	Printed on the box is a cartoon caricature of the Oriental doctor 
	pointing to a bowl of his product with one of his long, sharp 
	fingernails.  there's a burst above the product name that reads:  
	"FREE INSIDE - FU-MAN FINGERS" and shows a drawing of a hand 
	wearing several extra-long, red plastic fingernails on its 
	fingertips.

	Mom lets Angela go o with her search and turns back to Jesse, 
	waiting for his answer.

						MOM
			Jess?

						JESSE
			Huh?

						MOM
			Eggs?

	Jesse rubs his temples.  He was away for a minute but he's back 
	now.

						JESSE
			Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.

						MOM
			You okay?

	Dad eyes him suspicously.

						JESSE
			Yeah, I'm fine.  Just really hot 
			upstairs.

						MOM
					(nods)
			I know it's warm...
					(to Dad)
			I wish you'd call someone to check out
			the air conditioning, Ken.

						DAD
					(defensively)
			I know what's wrong with the air
			coditioning - just needs a shot of 
			freon, is all.

						JESSE
			Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit
			the deck!

						DAD
			Don't be a smart ass.

	A short silence as they all look back to their plates.

						MOM
					(to Jesse)
			So, school going alright?

						JESSE
					(shrugs)
			Okay, I guess.

						MOM
			Making friends?

	Jesse is looking around for some escape - this interrogation is 
	getting a little too personal.

						JESSE
			Yeah, you know how it is...

	ON ANGELA

	She grabs onto the prize at the botto of the box and gives a yank.  
	A bagful of Fu Man Fingers come out in her hand along with half 
	the box of cereal.

	SOUND OVER:  DOORBELL RINGING

	Mom turns to answer the door, but Jesse immediately jumps up and 
	cuts her off.

						JESSE
			That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.

						DAD
					(calling after him)
			Who's Lisa?

	But Jesse is gone; just a kitchen door, swinging in his wake.

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

	as JESSE opens the front door to LISA POLETTI (17).  She is facing 
	the street and she turns around when she hears the door open.  Not 
	a knock-out but real pretty, with an intelligence and sweetness 
	about her -- she is truly lovely.

						LISA
			Hi.

	She smiles and Jesse's eyes light up.

	EXT. WALSH HOUSE - DAY

	They walk to JESSE'S CAR - a beat-up, blue Falcon parked curbside.

						JESSE
					(gratefully)
			your timing was perfect - I was 
			getting the third degree in there.

						LISA
			How come?

						JESSE
			Ah, nothing.

	Jesse opens Lisa's car door for her.  She steps in and sits down.

	IN THE CAR

	The interior is worse than the body.  The upholstery is torn to 
	shreds, the dashboard is cracked and peeling and there's a big 
	hole where the radio used to be.  A cheap, A.M. transistor radio 
	hangs by its wrist strap from the rear-view mirror.

	Jesse hops in and shifts around to get comfortable, and reaches 
	under the dash to pull out a couple of bare wires.

	Lisa watches him routinely twist the wires together, amused.

						LISA
			Aren't you afraid somebody could
			steal your car like that?

						JESSE
					(preposterously)
			Look at this car.  Are you kidding?

	He sits up again and reaches for a toggle switch that has been 
	crudely drilled into the dash.  He flicks the switch.

	Jesse moves his finger to another alien button in the dash and 
	pushes it.  The STARTER turns over slowly, the engine BACKFIRES 
	and the car starts noisily.

	Jesse gives her the "thumbs up" as if he were a World War I Ace 
	and puts the car into gear.  It BUCKS and FARTS and rumbles up the 
	street.

	EXT. POOL - REAR, WALSH HOUSE - DAY

	DAD floats on a FOAM CHAIR in the middle of the rather run-down 
	pool, sipping coffee from a MUG bearing the word "DAD".  He looks 
	over his domain with satisfaction and inhales a deep breath of 
	fresh, suburban sir.

	MOM comes out the back door.  She looks just a bit worried.

						MOM
			Ken, shouldn't you be getting to the
			office?  It's almost nine.

						KEN
			As soon as i finish my coffee.  I'm
			enjoying my pool right now.
					(sips his coffee)
			I love our new house.  Don't you?

						MOM
					(sighs heavily)
			Of course I do, Ken.

						KEN
			What's the problem, Shirl?

						MOM
					(pointing behind her)
			It's just I'll be a lot happier when 
			you finish taking down those bars.

	CAMERA PANS UP AND ZOOMS IN to reveal BARS ON THE UPPER WINDOWS -- 
	this is the old Thompson house, replete with the security 
	paraphernalia that kept Nancy Thompson prisoner five years prior.

						MOM (O.C.)
			People that lived here before must
			have been truly paranoid.

	EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

	Establishing shot of school, shot from parking lot with JESSE'S 
	CAR in f.g.  School is in session, so the only students we see are 
	TWO CLASS-CUTTERS leaning against a car passing a JOINT.

	EXT. HIGHT SCHOOL PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

	An intramural SOFTBALL GAME is in progress.  COACH SCHNEIDER, a 
	nasty looking ex-Marine, stands behind home plate as an umpire.

	JESSE is covering second base.

	RONNY GRADY, a tough-looking wise-ass type, steps up to the plate.  
	He knocks the mud off his sneakers with his bat and takes his 
	stance.

	ON JESSE

	He glances over to the adjacent field.

	HIS POV

	The GIRLS are in the middle of archery instruction.

	LISA is there, mighty tempting looking in her little, powder blue 
	gym suit, a quiver strapped to her shoulder and a longbow in her 
	hand.

	KERRY, a dizzy, Bloomingdale's-punk, steps up alongside Lisa as 
	the latter catches Jesse's stare.

						SCHNEIDER (O.C.)
			Strike!

						KERRY
					(to Lisa, re Jesse)
			He made any moves yet?

	Lisa smiles and waves to Jesse.

						LISA
					(aside to Kerry)
			I only know him a few weeks, Kerry.

	ON JESSE

	He waves back.

	BACK TO LISA AND KERRY

						KERRY
			I think he needs a push start.

	Lisa turns to face the target, slides an arrow into the nocking 
	point, draws back the bowstring and lets the arrow go.

	ON THE TARGET

	It's a bull's-eye.

	CRACK!

	GRADY gets hold of a perfect pitch and sends it flying over the 
	head of the PITCHER.

	BACK TO JESSE

	BOOM!

	The ball skids off the side of his head and the kid collapses. 

	HIS TEAMMATES rush to his side and help Jesse to his feet.  He's 
	more embarrassed than hurt and he waves away any over-attention.  
	COACH SHNEIDER joins the circle of bodies around him.

						SCHNEIDER
			You okay?

						JESSE
			Yeah, I'm fine.

						SCHNEIDER
					(walking away)
			Well, pay attention, next time!

	Jesse re-takes his position on the base.

						GRADY (O.C.)
			Maybe you oughta try something a little
			more your speed, Walsh.  Like knitting.

	Jesse just now realizes that it was Grady who scored a double off 
	his skull.  He's standing just off the bag, harassing Jesse while 
	waiting to be hit home.

						JESSE
					(flipping him the bird)
			Knit this, Grady.

	GRADY sneers and gives him the "JACK-OFF" sign.

	JESSE tosses an "ITALIAN SALUTE", slapping one hand into the crook 
	of his arm and throwing up "THE FINGER" for good measure.

	GRADY grabs his own crotch and points to it obscenely.

	ON THE PITCHER

	He sends one over the plate, the BATTER catches it dead-center and 
	POUNDS it back to left field.
 
	GRADY makes a break for third, only to be forced back by teh LEFT 
	FIELDER tossing the ball to the THIRD BASEMAN.

	ON JESSE

	His glove up to receive the throw as Grady STEAMS towards him.

	The ball snaps into Jesse's mitt and Grady turns on his ankles to 
	shoot back to third.

	Jesse and the third baseman toss the ball between, each time 
	moving closer in toward Grady.  Grady switches directions with the 
	ball, trapped between them.

	GRADY dives into a HEAD-FIRST SLIDE, trying to sneak past Jesse.

	JESSE swoops down and tags him out.

	Thorougly aggravated, Grady rises to his feet by reaching out and 
	grabbing onto Jesse's gym shorts and yanking them down to his 
	ankles, revealing jesse's bare buns-in-a-jockstrap to the world.

	JESSE lunges for Grady, trips over his shorts and the two of them 
	begin rolling around in the dirt, duking it out.

	ON THE GIRLS IN THE NEXT FIELD

	watching the wrestling match with ausement.

	ON LISA AND KERRY

	Lisa tries like hell to repress some laughter.

						KERRY
			Cut ass.

	ON SCNEIDER

	pushing his way through a crowd of laughing, cheering SPECTATORS 
	and jumping in to break up the scuffle.

	He lifts both boys up by their necks.

						SCHNEIDER
			Okay boys, assume the position!

	INT. COACH'S OFFICE - DAY

	Schneider is at his desk.  TWO BOYS carrying gym bags pass outside 
	the Coach's office.  They wave to him through the WIRE-GLASS 
	WINDOWS.

						BOYS
			'Night Coach.

	Schneider gives them a cold glance.

	He checks his watch, gets up and goes to a window to look outside.

	HIS POV - THE PRACTICE FIELD

	JESSE and GRADY, side by side in the center of the baseball 
	diamond.  They are in "front-leaning rest" position, the cruel and 
	painful frozen pushup that ends halfway to the ground with elbows 
	bent.

	We don't know how long they've been out there but it's probably 
	hours.  It seems just a little darker out and a lonely wind is 
	blowing around their arms and legs.

	In the B.G., KIDS are filing out of the building - some sop to 
	look out at the two boys, point and snicker.

	ANGLE:

	We see LISA among the kids.  She stops for a moment and views the 
	scene with concern.

	ON JESSE AND GRADY

	They are dirty, their shirts are ripped and Jesse has a tiny 
	bruise over his cheek.

	And they're tired too.  The muscles in their arms are twitching 
	convulsively and they talk to each other between groans and 
	through teeth clenched with pain.

	We hear the OFF-CAMERA SOUND of several busses pulling out.

						JESSE
			How much longer you figure he'll keep
			us out here?

						GRADY
			Could be all night.
					(nodding in the Coach's
					 direction)
			Guy gets his rocks off like this.
			Hangs out in queer S & M joints
			downtown.  Likes prettyboys like
			you.

						JESSE
			Get outa here.

	Grady doesn't pursue it.  Instead, he looks around and tries to 
	think of some small-talk.

						GRADY
					(finally)
			So, what about you and that Poletti
			girl?

						JESSE
			What about it?

						GRADY
			You two got a thing going, or what?

						JESSE
			She's a neighbor, I drive her to
			school.

						GRADY
			She giving you any carfare for the 
			ride?

						JESSE
			You got a problem with me, Grady?

						GRADY
					(shrugs)
			Naw. Just killing time.

	SOUND OVER:  A WHISTLE BLOWING

	ON THE COACH

	Dressed in his street clothes, crossing the field toward the 
	faculty parking lot.  He pulls the whistle from his mouth.

						SCHNEIDER
					(to the boys)
			Okay boys, hit the showers.

	INT. BOYS LOCKER ROOM - DAY

	JESSE and GRADY stand at opposite ends of a row of lockers and 
	change into their street clothes.  Their movements are slow and 
	cumbersome - like a pair of creaky old men.

						GRADY
					(finally)
			So, you live around here.

						JESSE
					(sighs wearily)
			Not too far.  My folks bought a place
			over on Elm Street.

	Grady stops buttoning his shirt and looks up at Jesse.

						GRADY
			Elm Street?  You telling me you moved
			in to that big white house with the
			bars on the windows?

						JESSE
			Yeah, why?

	Grady shakes his head and tucks his shirtails in.

						GRADY
			Shit, you can tell your old man he's 
			a real chump.

						JESSE
			What the hell are you talking about?

						GRADY
			They've only been trying to unload 
			that dump for five years.  That 
			place is bad news.  Some chick was
			locked in there by her mother and
			she went crazy.  She watched her 
			boyfriend get butchered by some 
			maniac in the house across the street.  
			Her poor drunken momma took her own
			life right inside your front door.

	Jesse stares dubiously at Grady.

						JESSE
					(with a nervous laugh)
			You're full of shit.

	Jesse pulls his knapsack from the locker shelf, slams the door 
	shut and walks away.

	ON GRADY

	He smiles mischievously and shuts his own locker door.

	EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

	JESSE'S CAR is parked among a handful of others.  LISA leans 
	against the front fender, waithing patiently.

	HER POV

	JESSE steps out of the building and spots her.  he hurries across 
	the lot.

	ON LISA

	as Jesse approaches.

						JESSE
					(surprised to see her)
			Hi!  You didn't have to wait.

						LISA
			That's okay, I wanted to.

	He raises an eyebrow as he opens the door for her.  He likes that.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as Jesse slides in beside her and STARTS the engine.

	She looks him over.  He looks like he's been through the mill a 
	couple of times.

						LISA
			You okay?

						JESSE
			Yeah, yeah, sure.

						LISA
			Let me look at your eye...

	Jesse lifts his chin to show off the tiny bruise over his 
	cheekbone.  He looks almost a little proud of it - like it's an 
	old war wound.  Lisa touches it tenderly.

						LISA
			You shouldn't be fighting with that
			jerk.

						JESSE
			Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's 
			just a hothead.

						LISA
			You mean a shithead.

						JESSE
					(laughs)
			Yeah.

	He guns the engine and they pull away.

	EXT. WALSH HOUSE - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT

	It's very late.  The house is dark and even the crickets have hit 
	the sack.

	INT. JESSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	JESSE's having trouble sleeping.  He turns over on different sides 
	and punches up his pillow a couple of times, stares into space and 
	finally sits up.

	He gets out of bed, pulls on a pair of pants and exits.

	KITCHEN

	He enters.  The room is lit only by the glow of a three quarter 
	moon.

	He regains his composure and steps over to the sink to pull off an 
	absurd length of paper toweling.

	We see it just when Jesse does;  a GROTESQUE FACE has been peering 
	into the window all this time.  It disappears from view on Jesse's 
	DOUBLE TAKE.

	Jesse stops for a moment to slow down his heart.  He takes a deep 
	breath and steps up to the back door.

	He opens the door.

	EXT. SIDE OF WALSH HOUSE - NIGHT

	Jesse opens the gate and enters.  It is really quiet; not even 
	night-sounds.

	He strains to see past the shrubbery that surrounds the house.

						JESSE
					(hoarse whisper)
			Grady?

	He looks around.

						JESSE
			It better be you, you son of a bitch!

	We hear an awful sound from somewhere - WOOD RIPPIGNG.

	Jesse makes his way cautiously along the side of the house.

	He notices a red-orange LIGHT is flickering from behind a cellar 
	window.  He gets down on his hands and knees to investigate.

	THE CELLAR - HIS POV

	An INTRUDER is bent over by the furnace, lit only by a raging fire 
	in the fire-box.  He puts his hand right into the flames and 
	begins digging for something way in the back of the furnace.  We 
	can't see his face but he is dressed in a filthy green and red 
	striped sweater and a battered hat.

	He pulls out a bundle of rags, sets it on top of the furnace and 
	proceeds to unwrap it.

	ON JESSE

						JESSE
					(petrified)
			Holy shit...

	He stands up and looks around frantically.  He doesn't know what 
	to do.

						JESSE
					(near tears)
			Holy shit...

	He hurries out the gate that leads to the front of the house.

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - NIGHT

	Jesse enters the house and scans the foyer.  He heads toward the	 
	cellar door.  It is ajar -- the LOCKHAS BEEN SPLINTERED AS IF BY A 
	HUGE WRECKING BAR -- and we can hear the ROAR of the furnace from 
	below.

	He sticks his head inside the cellar door and peeks down.

	HIS POV

	The SHADOW OF A FIGURE; movement on the cellar walls.

	ON JESSE

	Breathing heavily.  Brain whirring.

	SLAM!

	He pulls the basement door closed and holds it shut tight, 
	practically hyper-ventilating.

						JESSE
					(screaming)
			Dad!

	He looks around frantically.

						JESSE
			DAD!

	Something inside starts to pull the cellar door open.  Jesse tries 
	to hold it shut, but the inexorable force continues to inch it 
	open.

	Jesse lets go and bolts toward the foyer.  FREDDY is standing in 
	his path, a sick smile on his scarred face.  He flashes his razor-
	knives at Jesse.

						FREDDY
					(sinisterly)
			Daddy can't help you now.

	Jesse tries to make a break for it but Freddy is too fast.  His 
	un-taloned hand gets an iron grip on Jesse's shirt collar.

						FREDDY
			I've been waiting five years for you,
			Jesse.  We got special work to do, you
			and me.  Things are really gonna heat
			up.

	Jesse struggles to get free.  Freddy tightens his iron grip and 
	fans his talons threateningly.  Jesse's head stretches back from 
	the chocking pain.

						FREDDY
			We'll do real good together, you and
			me.

	Freddy hurls Jesse against the wall.

						FREDDY
			You got the body...
					(doffs his hat)
			I got the brains.

	With that, Freddy removes his hat.  There is no skull under there 
	- just a pulsating mass of blody BRAIN MATTER.

	JESSE lets out an agonized SCREAM.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. JESSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	ON JESSE, still in bed but his entire body arched backwards over 
	the mattress.  His scream continues until he collapses back down 
	into the sheets.

	ON HIS DOOR

	It flies open and DAD crashes into the room, followed by MOM.  
	They go to his bedside and stare at him as he pants and coughs his 
	way back to consciousness.

						MOM
					(to Dad)
			Maybe we should call a doctor.

						JESSE
			No.  I'm okay.

	He sits up to prove it.

						JESSE
			Really.  Just a bad dream.

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL BIOLOGY CLASSROOM - DAY

	A rather bored looking group of STUDENTS is listening with little 
	interest to the droning of their teacher, MR ABLE, who is 
	lecturing them from the front of the room.

						MR. ABLE
			So, to review, the solid waste, those
			nutrients that are not absorbed in the
			lining of the stomach, the large 
			intestine, the small intestine - the
			alimentary canal - are passed out 
			through the colon...

	SOUND OVER:  A FAKE FART

	LAUGHTER from the class.

	ABLE looks up crossly from his notes until the laughs trail off.

						MR. ABLE (O.C.)
					(continues)
			The liquid nutrients are then carried
			through an elaborate system of filtering,
			aided by the pancreas, liver and gall
			bladder...

	TWO GIRLS at the back of the room look at each other.  One puts 
	her finger in her mouth and pretends to gag.

	As Able DRONES on in the B.G., we're

	ON JESSE

	He's having a hell of a time keeping his eyes open.  His head bobs 
	intermittently as he starts to nod out.

	ON GRADY

	He nudges a CLASSMATE at the next desk to look over toward Jesse.  
	They snicker.

	ON JESSE, THEIR POV

	nodding out

	BACK TO ABLE

						MR. ABLE
			Or collected in the bladder to be expelled
			at a later time.  And this entire process
			is kept moving through "the circulatory
			system", the center of which is...
					(a beat)
			...the heart.

	On the beat, he reaches under his lab table and plunks a BLOODY 
	CALF'S HEART down right in the center of it.

	We hear DISGUSTED GROANS from the class.

						MR. ABLE
			...Four chambers, just like the human
			heart, really.

	Able describes the path by sticking his index finger into each 
	orifice.

						MR ABLE
			From the body, through the right auricle,
			to the right ventricle and out the 
			pulmonary artery to the lungs.

	BACK TO JESSE, ASLEEP

	A particularly ugly and ferocious looking SNAKE is wrapping itself 
	around his arm, making its way toward Jesse's face.

	CLOSE ON JESSE

	As he wakes up slowly and looks down groggily toward his arm.

	THE SNAKE

	opens wide and emitsa long demonic hiss.

	Jesse screams and hastily begins pulling the reptile away from 
	him.

	ON ABLE

	Standing next to Jesse, he pulls the snake off his arm and drops 
	it into a nearby tank.

						MR. ABLE
			If you want to play with animals, Mr.
			Walsh, join the circus.

	GUFFAWS from the class.

	JESSE looks around, bewildered and embarrassed.

	He spots GRADY, grinning widely.

	INT. THE WALSH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING

	Comfortable and very suburban.  A major color T.V. takes up the 
	wall opposite a pair of His and Hers Barcaloungers.

	DAD is watching The Six O'clock News on the tube and fanning 
	himself with a T.V. Guide.

	MOM sits on the couch with ANGELA, helping her with a jigsaw 
	puzzle.

	TWO PARAKEETS are fluttering around inside a cage near the entry 
	into the dining room.

	JESSE bounces down the stairway, a rolled towel tucked under his 
	arm.

	DAD stares at him angrily then turns back to the game.

	JESSE CROSSES in front of the set on his way out of the room.

						DAD
			Where are you going?

						JESSE
			Just out for a while.

						DAD
					(shaking his head)
			I told you I want that room unpacked.

						JESSE
					(begging)
			Oh, come on Dad...

						DAD
			No.
					(pointing toward the
					 stairway)
			Upstairs.

	Jesse's about to protest but Dad cuts him off.

						DAD
					(firmly)
			Now.

	Jesse turns around, mumbles something under his breath and stomps 
	back upstairs.

	EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE -EARLY EVENING

	A pair of glass sliders lead from the house onto a stretch of 
	patio that surrounds a gorgeous built-in swimming pool.  The patio 
	is dotted with all the amenities of backyard recreation: a gas 
	bar-b-que grill, a wet-bar, plenty of pipe furniture and even a 
	pair of free-standing cabanas.  The entire set-up is contained by 
	a six-foot, chain link security fence.

	LISA steps out of the cabana, wearing a swim suit.  She tosses her 
	towel onto a nearby chair and crosses to the diving board.

	ON THE BOARD

	She bounces lightly and jumps off, cutting gracefully through the 
	water and coming up in the center of the pool.

	MRS. POLETTI, a pleasant looking woman in her late 40's, slides 
	open the patio doors and pokes her head out.

						MRS. POLETTI
					(calling)
			There's a Jesse on the phone.

						LISA (O.C.)
			Okay...thanks.

	LISA swims to the edge of the pool and hoists herself up.  She 
	throws the towel over her shoulders and picks up a wireless phone 
	from a low table.

						LISA
			Jesse, hi...
					(a beat, diappointed)
			Oh...that's okay.  Sorry you can't
			make it.
					(a beat)
			No, I understand.  Parents can be
			real pains...I'll see you in the 
			morning, then...

	She hangs up and frowns.

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - JESSE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	JESSE stands at the foot of the bed, surveying the job unhappily 
	and trying to figure out where to start.

	Finally, he pulls a SHOE BOX from inside a larger carton, places 
	it on his desk and lifts the lid.

	It's full of cassette tapes.  He rifles through them, selecting 
	one and popping it inot a PORTABLE CASSETTE PLAYER on the desk.

	He pushes the "play" button.  The tape is ROCK AND ROLL.

	The music gets him moving a bit.  He surveys the room, then goes 
	to A CARTON NEAR THE BOOKSHELVES.  He reaches deep into the near-
	empty carton and pulls out a stack of books which he plops on the 
	shelves next to other books already unpacked.  He tosses the 
	carton aside.

	He's getting into the music now as he spins around to face the 
	bureau.  He opens a SMALL POX on the bureau while be-bopping along 
	and pulls out a PAIR OF SUNGLASSES which he puts on, practically 
	dancing.  He dumps the contents of the box haphazardly into a 
	bureau drawer.

	JESSE opens a large bureau drawer.  He grbs a nearby box and dumps 
	it into the large drawer, smoothing it over perfunctorily with his 
	hands.  A Stetson cowboy hat is on top.  He drops it on his head 
	and pulls it down low over his eyes.

	ON A FULL LENGTH MIRROR

	Jesse steps into frame to get a look at himself.  He likes what he 
	sees as he mimes a guitar riff along with the music.

	In one smooth move, in rhythm with the music, he seings around and 
	moves to the desk.  He dumps a SMALL BOX OF PENCILS AND SUPPLIES 
	into the desk drawer.  As an afterthought, he grabs a couple of 
	pencils out of the drawer and drums a few beats on the desk with 
	them.

	He shoves the pencils up his nostrils, tucks his thumbs under his 
	armpits and waves his elbows like he's doing the "Funky Chicken".  
	Silly stuff that one owuld only do behind closed doors.

	He spins around, throwing his arms out and stopping ddead in his 
	tracks.

	HIS POV

	LISA and MOM are standing in his doorway.  Mom looks horrified.  
	Lisa represses a giggle.

	Mom reaches over and knocks timidly on the open door.

	Jesse hastily pulls the pencils out of his nose and dives for the 
	stereo to turn it off.  Beet-red, he tosses the hat and sun 
	glasses onto the bed and tries to look nonchalant.

						JESSE
					(embarrassed)
			Hi.

	Jesse looks to Mom who takes the hint and turns to leave.  Lisa 
	takes a step into the room.

						LISA
					(when Mom is out of
					 range)
			I told her you invited me over.  I
			guess I should have called, huh?

	Behind the embarrassment, he's glad to see her.  He puts the 
	pencils in the desk drawer and shuts it.

						JESSE
			No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.

						LISA
			I know.

	Lisa casually steps over to a carton and peeks in.

						LISA
			I figured you might like some help.

						JESSE
					(pleasantly surprised)
			Yeah?

	JESSE'S ROOM - LATER

	The room is shaping up nicely with only a few boxes remaining.

	Jesse pulls a bundle wrapped in newspapers from a carton.  He 
	tears away the paper, revealing a baseball trophy.

	He places it on a conspicuous corner of his dresser.

	Lisa reaches into the box, retrieves an aerosol can and looks at 
	it.

	ON THE CAN

	A medicated spray for JOCK ITCH.

						LISA (O.C.)
			Where does this go?

	JESSE grabs the can from her hand and puts it down on the dresser 
	behind the trophy.

						JESSE
					(mortified)
			There's a box of sweaters over there 
			if you want to put them up in the 
			closet.

	Lisa is anxious to pitch in.  She nods good-naturedly and steps 
	over to her assignment.

										     CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE CLOSET

	As Lisa opens the door and pulls an overhead chain to switch on 
	the light.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as she drags a chair over, lifts a pile of sweaters from an open 
	box, steps up on the chair and stacks them on a shelf.  She starts 
	to step back down when something catches her attention in  the 
	back corner of the shelf.

	She reaches in and pulls out a small, red leatherbound book.

						LISA
			What's this?

	Jesse steps over to look at it.

	ON THE BOOK

	about two-thirds the size of an average paperback, it has a 
	matching leather thong that snaps into a small latch on the front 
	and opens the book.

						LISA
					(reading)
			"Nancy Thompson, 1428 Elm..."
					(looking up at him)
			Hey, this thing is five years old.

	Jesse steps over and looks over her shoulder.

						JESSE
			You know her?

						LISA
					(shaking her head)
			Uh-uh.  Before my time.

	She turns a few pages.

						LISA
					(reading)
			"February 17th - My birtday.  Daddy 	
			came by today with a big ol' stuffed 
			bear for me.  He took me to dinner 
			and a movie and when we got back, he 
			and Mother had another one of their 
			fights.  He left angry.  I wish they
			would stop fighting..."

	Jesse waves the diary away, uninterested.  He crosses back to 
	continue unpacking.

						LISA
			I think it's sad...

						JESSE
					(cynically)
			Traumas of a ten-year old.

	Lisa leafs through a few more pages, stops and begins reading with 
	widening eyes.  She glances at Jesse and smiles impishly.

						LISA
					(reading)
			"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep 
			with him again.  I can't yet - I 
			like him, I want to make him happy 
			but I'm not sure that I love him.  
			I can't sleep with someone I don't 
			love."

						JESSE
			That's typical.  I hope she didn't
			expect to make the best seller list 
			with this thing.

	Lisa ignores him and scans the page.

						LISA
					(finding something)
			Wow, listen to this!
					(reading)
			"Sometimes, when I'm lying here in 
			bed, I can see Glen, in his window
			across the way, getting ready for
			bed.  His body is slim and smooth
			and I know I shouldn't watch but
			that part of me that wants him
			forces me to.  That's when I
			weaken.  That's when I want to go
			to him..."

	Jesse is suddenly interested.  He walks over and Lisa hands him 
	the diary with the page open to that entry.

	He reads it and quickly turns the page.  He frowns and turns 
	another, then another.

						JESSE
			That's it?
					(another couple of
					 pages)
			Wait, she skipped a week.
					(reading)
			"March 15 - he comes to me at night.
			Horrible.  Ugly.  Dirty.  Under the
			sheets with me, tearing at my night-
			gown with his steel claw..."

	Jesse's voice trails off on "claw" and a chill of vague 
	recognition goes through him.  He checks the cover of te book and 
	flips back a few pages.

	Lisa moves closer to read over his shoulder.

	Jesse composes himself and looks back at the book.

						JESSE
					(reading)
			"His name is Fred and he keeps taking
			me to the boiler room.  He wants to
			kill me."

	Jesse almost shivers.  He turns the page, and he freezes.

						LISA
			What is it?

	ON THE DIARY

	Jesse shows her the page.  There is one sentence scrawled across 
	the next entry.  Lisa reads it.

						LISA
			"Tina is dead."

	ON JESSE AND LISA

	They look at each other, spooked.  He turns the page.

						JESSE
					(reading)
			"Rod's been killed - he got Rod.
			Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall
			asleep!"

						LISA
			Wow...

	Jesse's face turns ashen as he looks up at Lisa.

						LISA
			Are you okay.

						JESSE
					(nodding; covering)
			Something Grady told me today about
			the people that lived here last. 
			Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend
			killed in the house across the 
			street...

	He is interrupted by Mom, poking her head into the room.

						MOM
					(cheerfully)
			How's it going?

	Jesse instinctively hides the diary behind his back.

						JESSE
			Okay...

	She looks over the room, impressed at the progress.

						MOM
			Looks great!  Thought you might want
			to take a break - got some cold cider
			downstairs.

	Jesse looks at Lisa to see what she wants to do.

	Lisa looks over at Jese's alarm clock.  THe time is 8 P.M.

						LISA
					(standing up)
			No...thanks.  I better get back.
					(to Jesse)
			Got a major paper due the end of this
			week.

						MOM
					(ducking back out)
			Well, it's there if you change your 
			mind.

	Jesse waits for her to leave.

						JESSE
					(to Lisa)
			Are you sure?

						LISA
					(nods sourly)
			World History.
					(brightening)
			But, I'll see you in the morning, right?

	Jesse nods.

						LISA
					(pointing to the diary)
			Hot stuff.  Let me know how it turns
			out.

	Jesse opens the door for her.

						JESSE
			I'll walk you downstairs.

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	MOM wraps the night-cover over the BIRD CAGE.  She steps past 
	ANGELA on the couch and crosses in front of DAD, in his recliver, 
	vegetating in front of the tube.  SHe sits and loosens her collar 
	a bit.

	ON DAD

	He shifts uncomfortably and wipes some beaded sweat from his upper 
	lip.

						MOM
					(to Dad)
			A little warm in here, huh?

	Dad gets up from his chair.  His shirt is sticky with 
	perspiration.

	Jesse steps in from the dining room, a glass of milk in his hand.

	ON ANGELA

	looking up at Jesse.  She puts a finger to her lips.

						ANGELA
			Shhh...The birds are sleeping.

	Jesse notices the intense heat in the room immediately.  His eyes 
	widen portentiously.

	ON DAD

	at the thermostat.

						DAD
					(astounded)
			It's 97 degrees in here!

	He pulls off the coverplate and starts fiddling with the coil.

	Suddenly, a LOUD SQUAWK from the other side of the room makes 
	everyone look up.

	Jesse puts his milk down on he T.V. and hurries over to the cage, 
	ripping the cover away.

	ON THE BIRD CAGE

	Another series of HORRIBLE CRIES as one of the budgies proceeds to 
	rip up the neck of the other one with his sharp beak.

	LONGER ANGLE:

	Jesse throws open the door and tries to pull the attacking bird 
	off his victim.  the vicious one continues the rabid attacks on 
	Jesse's hand, drawing blood.

	As Jesse pulls his arm out, the bird flies out into the living 
	room, roaring a repetitive WAR-CRY that is eerie and unnatural for 
	something that size.

	MOM and DAD jump to their feet.  ANGELA starts screaming at the 
	top of her lungs.

	ON THE BIRD

	It circles around the ceiling and then DIVES for Dad, cutting a 
	deep gash under his eye.  It seems much larger than it was before 
	- maybe twice its original size.

						DAD
					(screaming)
			Get a broom or something!

	ANGLE: LIVING ROOM

	Mom dashes out of the room.

	THE BIRD swoops down, heading for Angela but crashing into the 
	shade of a table lamp, knocking it to the floor.

	It flutters to the ceiling and hovers near a light fixture.  Its 
	beak and most of its head is covered in blood and it opens its 
	mouth to emit a gutteral growl.

	MOM returns with a broom and hands it to Dad.

	As Dad approaches and lifts the broom to his shoulder, the bird 
	screams agai and dives for Jesse.
	
	Jesse throws his arm out to block the attack.  The bird reverses 
	direction and Dad swings in mid-air with the broom.

	He misses, demolishing the remaining table lamp instead.

	ON THE BIRD

	It hovers again in the air, seemingly without any means of 
	support, PUFFING UP, GROWING ANGRIER, MORE DEMONIC.  Then, just as 
	it seems ready for a last lethal attack, there is a loud BANG and 
	the bird literally EXPLODES into FLAMES in mid-air.

	The family looks at one another in horror and disbelief.  The only 
	sound in the room is ANGELA, attached to her mother's leg and 
	whimpering quietly.

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	CRASH!

	DAD 	dumps an odd assortment of home handyan tools on the kitchen 
	table.  He picks through them, selecting a pipe wrench and a screw 
	driver.

	He crosses to the stove.  We see Mom in the B.G., standing, not 
	quite cowering, still in shock from the bird attack.

	Jesse is leaning on the counter, next to the range, watching his 
	father's determined moves.

	Dad leans into the appliance and attempts to pull it away from the 
	wall, probably tearing six or seven ligaments in the process.

	After several tries, he stops and looks up at his son.

						DAD
			Help me with this thing!

						JESSE
			It's not the gas, Dad!

						DAD
					(angrily)
			Don't tell me it's not the gas!

	He yanks on the stove with more vehemence.

						DAD
			Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your
			mother thought she smelled gas.

						MOM
					(timidly)
			I wasn't sure, Ken...

						DAD
					(to Mom)
			Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies?
			That cheap seed you've been buying?

						MOM
					(resenting that)
			Oh, please...

						DAD
			What is it then?  There's got to be an
			explanation.  Animals just don't burst
			into flames for no reason!

						JESSE
			Well it sure isn't leaky gas pipes.

	Dad stands up suddenly, CRACKING his head on the edge of the range 
	hood.

						MOM
					(concerned)
			Ken!

	As he groans in pain, he's suddenly hit with a revelation.  He 
	points an accusatory finger at Jesse.

						DAD
			You set this all up, didn't you?  One
			of your sick jokes?

						JESSE
			What are you talking about?

						DAD
			You know what I'm talking about.  What
			did you use, a fire cracker?  A cherry
			bomb?

	Jesse is angry now.

						JESSE
			I don't have to listen to this!

	He storms out of the kitchen.

						DAD
			Come back here!

						MOM
					(upset)
			Ken!

	Dad looks blankly at the wrench in his trembling hand.

						DAD
			I don't know...I don't know, Shirl.
			He used to be a good kid.

										     CUT TO:

	EXT. JESSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Dark again, sleeping soundly.

	INT. WALSH HOME - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Jesse emerges from his room and eases the door shut as quietly as 
	possible.  He stops to listen for any signs of his parents being 
	awake.

	SOUND OVER: SNORES FROM BEHIND THEIR BEDROOM DOOR

	He steps lightly past their room adn toward the head of the 
	stairs.

	WE FOLLOW Jesse as he descends the stairs into the darkened foyer.

	THE CELLAR DOOR

	Jesse stops there, momentarily losing his nerve.

	He finally turns the knob and opens the door.

	INT. WALSH HOME - CELLAR - NIGHT

	Jesse pulls an overhead chain, flooding the cellar with light.

	It's just as he saw it in his dream but devoid of any intruders.

	he steps up the the furnace, squats down and opens the firebox 
	door.  He reaches in.  To his horror, he feels something and pulls 
	out an object, wrapped in rags.

	ON THE OBJECT

	as he unwraps it.  An old, beat leather glove with a row of rusty 
	knife blades protruding from the fingers.

	Suddenly, the furnace switches on with a ROAR.

	FLAMES are leaping out of the firebox.

						FREDDY (O.C.)
					(laughingly)
			Hot enough for you?

	JESSE reels around.

	FREDDY is just across the room.

						FREDDY
					(re: the glove)
			Go ahead, Jesse.  Try it on for size!

	Jesse looks at the glove.  The blades are no longer rusted but 
	gleaming and sharp.

	he throws the weapon to the floor.  Freddy moves in closer.

						JESSE
			What do you want?

						FREDDY
			I need you to finish my work.  Let me
			teach you, Jesse.  We'll have fun.  
			You like my little trick with the 
			bird?

	Freddy advances.  Jesse steps behind a stack of cartons.

						FREDDY
			Kill for me.
					(laughing)
			c'mon Jesse.  Come to Freddy.

	Jesse pushes over a stack of cartons in his path and dives for the 
	steps.

	Halfway up he misses his footing and slips, tumbling back down.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As Jesse comes to at the foot of the cellar steps.  The furnace 
	has stopped and Freddy is gone.  As he gets to his feet, he 
	notices.

	THE GLOVE

	on te floor, where he dropped it as shiny and new as the day it 
	was made.

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

	MOM, DAD, and ANGELA are all at the breakfast table, picking at 
	their food; none of them is particularly hungry this morning.

	JESSE enters and heads wordlessly to a coffee pot on the stove.  
	he pours himself a cup and turns abound to face his family.

	Jesse and Dad are making an extra effort to avoid each other's eye 
	contact.

	ON ANGELA

	She's still feeling bad, drawing little circles in a puddle of 
	maple syrup with a corner of her waffle.

						JESSE
					(to Dad, suddenly)
			Why did it take them five years to sell
			this house, Dad?

	Dad shrugs his shoulders uncomfortably.

						DAD
			I don't know.  COuldn't get the right
			price, I suppose.

						JESSE
			And you don't know anything about a 
			murder across the street and a 
			crazy girl who lived here - who 
			saw the whole thing?

	Mom looks at Dad.  This is all news to her.

						DAD
					(testily)
			I don't know.
					(a beat, coming clean)
			They told me something about it, yeah.
			What difference does it make?

	He feels Mom's stare and finally turns to her.

						DAD
			Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think
			we got such a good deal?
					(to Jesse)
			Listen - all old houses have stories.

						JESSE
			Did they tell you she went totally 
			out of her mind - that they had to
			put her away?  And that her mother
			killed herself in our living room?

	ON ANGELA

	She slides up to Mom.

						ANGELA
			Mommy, I'm scared.

						MOM
					(comforting her)
			Shhhhh.  Jesse and Daddy are just
			making believe, sweetheart.
					(to Jesse)
			I don't think we should be talking
			about this now.

	Dad turns back to Jesse.

						DAD
					(indicating Angela)
			You see what you're doing?  Now I
			don't want to hear another word
			about it.  There's nothing wrong 
			with this house!

	ON MOM

	he looks up from Angela and sniffs the air.

						MOM
			Something burning?

	Mom and Dad oth look toward the counter-top.

	THE TOASTER, THEIR POV

	GLOWING RED-HOT and then, not just smokey toast but FLAMES leaping 
	out of the bread slots.

	Mom gasps and Dad jumps to his feet, grabs a dish-towel and begins 
	beating out the fire.

	JESSE turns white as he watches the scene.

	Dad turns white as he watches the scene.

	DAD turns away from the smoldering toaster, tosses the towel aside 
	and heads back toward the table.

						DAD
			Craziest damn thing I ever saw - wasn't
			even plugged in.

	Jesse puts his cut down hard on the counter and walks out.  THe 
	screen door slams behind him.

	Mom looks at Dad, horrified as Anglea clings to ehr side.

	EXT. MC DONALD'S PARKING LOT - DAY

	IN JESSE'S CAR

	As JESSE unrolls the bundle of rags he found the night before and 
	lets the finger knives drop with a CLATTER on the seat between 
	himself and LISA.

	On Lisa's side of the dashboard we see the remnants of a big, 
	fast-food breakfast;  Egg McMuffin, danish, orange juice and 
	coffee.  Jesse nurses a cup of joe as Lisa picks up the glove and 
	examines it with interest.

						LISA
			This is amazing!  Your dream told you
			where this was?

						JESSE
					(nods)
			Only it was more like, you know, sleep-
			walking.  All I know is I woke up on
			the cellar floor next to it.

	He reaches into his knapsack and pulls out the diary.

						JESSE
			Forget about going back to sleep after
			that.  I was up all night.
					(more intense)
			I finished reading this.  It gets real
			crazy towards the end, after all the
			death stuff.  But then she said some-
			thing really freaky - about her mother
			taking her down to the basement to 
			show her the glove.

	ON LISA

	She's totally sucked in to the story, wide-eyes and waiting for 
	more.  She offers a french fry to Jesse.  He shakes his head.  She 
	pops it into her mouth and nods for Jesse to go on.

						JESSE
			That's when she started talking about
			Fred Krueger.

						LISA
			Who?

						JESSE
			Fred Krueger.  The guy in her dream 
			who's coming to kill her.  Seems he 
			was a real guy, ten years before who
			went around kidnapping kids and 
			killing them.

	ON LISA

	She emits a long, windy whistle.

	INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY

	KIDS are at their lockers, taking off their jackets and getting 
	together everything they'll need for the day.

	ON JESSE AND LISA

	As they walk down the hall together.

						LISA
			Maybe you were having a premonition or
			something.  You know, like those guys
			who help the police solve crimes and 
			find missing people.  You ever had 
			anything like this happen before?

	Jesse thinks about it.

						JESSE
					(finally)
			No. Never.
					(a beat)
			You think that's what it is?

						LISA
					(thoughtfully)
			I don't know.

	They stop in the middle of the corridor.

						LISA
			Can I look at that diary for a little
			while?

	Jesse raises his eyebrows vaguely, reaches in his bag and hands 
	over the book.

						LISA
					(taking it)
			Thanks.

	Before she can go on, they are interrupted by a squeaky voice to 
	their side.  At the sound of it, Lisa displays annoyed 
	recognition.

						KERRY (O.C.)
			Hi, guys.

	LONGER ANGLE:

						LISA
			Hi, Kerry.

						KERRY
					(to Lisa)
			I got your invitation yesterday.  
			Thanks.
					(a beat)
			Any cute guys gonna be there?

						LISA
					(tired sigh)
			All of them.

						KERRY
			Yor dad picking the music again?

						LISA
					(smiles)
			Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.

	Jesse looks at Lisa quizzically.

						LISA
					(to Jesse)
			Last party I had, Dad insisted on 
			playing nothing but Benny Goodman
			records all night.

	The class bell RINGS.

	Lisa leans over and kisses Jesse.

						LISA
			I'll see you later, okay?

	The kiss takes him by surprise as she walks off with Kerry.

						JESSE
					(calling after her)
			I may be late.  Baseball practice!

	EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

	The school TEAM has been split up into two sides.  There's an air 
	of excitement about - like it's a close game, drawing to an end.

	GRADY is on third, waiting to be hit home.

	The PITCHER winds and throws.

	ON THE BATTER

	A swing and a miss.  SCHNEIDER calls him out.

	He tosses the bat aside, disgustedly.

	JESSE is on deck.  As he approaches the plate:

						A TEAMATE (O.C.)
			Last out.  Up to you, Walsh.

	ON GRADY

	He sneers like they might as well just concede the game now and go 
	home early.

	The PITCHER sends one right down the middle.

	JESSE lets it go and Schneider calls a strike.

	He chokes up a bit on the bat and takes his stance.

	Another perfect pitch and Jesse lets it go again.

						SCHNEIDER
			Strike!

	Grady slaps himself in the face and shakes his head pitifully.

	The PITCHER throws another.

	This time, Jese catches it perfectly, SLAMMING it down the middle 
	for a solid hit.

	GRADY scores amid cheers and slaps on the back.  JESSE holds up at 
	first.

	INT. BOY'S LOCKER ROOM - DAY

	JESSE is at the end of a row of lockers.  He pulls off his shirt 
	and tosses it in the locker, takes down a towel and sets it down 
	on the bench next to him.

	Several BOYS pass by on their way to their lockers or the showers, 
	giving Jesse the thumbs-up.

						BOYS
			Good game, Walsh...Way to go, Walsh
			...etc.

	GRADY approaches and goes to his own locker, down a few from 
	Jesse's.

	Jesse plops down on the bench and slowly pulls off his sneakers.  
	He stops to rub his aching shoulders.

						GRADY
					(finally)
			You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.

						JESSE
			It was okay.

						GRADY
			Who told you to choke up that way?

						JESSE
			My Dad.  He played in the minors for
			a while, when he got out of college.

						GRADY
					(impressed)
			No shit.

	They continue undressing in silence.  As Jesse speaks, COACH 
	SCHNEIDER steps up behind them.

						JESSE
			Schneider shouldn't have called you
			out on that double.

						GRADY
			Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick
			up his ass today.

						JESSE
					(laughs)
			Schneider's always got a stick up
			his ass.

	Schneider smiles wickedly as he places his hands on the two boys' 
	shoulders.

	EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY

	JESSE and GRADY trudge along at somewhere between a job and a 
	stumble.  They talk to each other with words that are punctuated 
	by huffs, puffs and side-stitches.

						JESSE
					(cautiously)
			You remember your dreams, Grady?

						GRADY
			Only the wet ones.

	Jesse shoots him a condescending sneer and decides not to pursue 
	it.

	EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

	The lot is practically empty with most of the students on heir way 
	home by now.  Jesse's car is parked in the center.

	LISA is leaning on the car, waiting with a stack of books at her 
	side.  She looks up as Jesse approaches.

						JESSE
			Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.

						LISA
			I just got here myself.  Went to the
			Public Library.
					(proudly)
			Cut four classes!

	He opens the door for her.  She picks up the books and climbs in.  
	Jesse runs around to the other side and slides in beside her.

						JESSE
					(indicating the books)
			What's all this.

						LISA
			Research.
					(she kisses him)
			Hi.
					(an intriguing wink)
			C'mon, let's go for a ride.

	EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

	The blue Falcon rolls down the highway.

	INSIDE

	JESSE is driving as LISA re-stacks some of the books on her lap 
	and begins leafing through one.

						LISA
			I'm convinced you've had a genuine
			psychic vision.

	Jesse looks over at her inquisitively.

						LISA
			At first I wasn't sure because you
			said that you never had anyting like 
			last night happen before.  But I 
			found out that most people have the
			potential for tuning in to "the 
			other world" and neve do.  It has
			something to do with the environment 
			- like they have to be in a place 
			that's sending signals.

						JESSE
			Like a haunted house, right?  I don't
			believe in ghosts.

						LISA
			You don't have to.  You just have to
			believe in energy.

	She shifts in her seat to face him.

						LISA
					(intensely)
			Look, you got electricity in your
			body, right?

						JESSE
			Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...

						LISA
			And heat and chemical reactions.
			Where does it all go when you die?

						JESSE
			I don't know - into the air I
			suppose.

						LISA
					(pointing up ahead)
			Make a left at this corner.

	Jesse turns at the intersection.

						LISA
			What about "essential energy" the 
			soul.  Does that go into the air
			too?  You think there's a good 
			energy and a bab energy?

						JESSE
					(confussed)
			I don't know.
					(a beat)
			Where are we going?

						LISA
					(smiles mysteriously)
			It's a surprise.

	EXT. ABANDONED POWER PLANT - DAY

	An old generating plant, big enough to have served what was once a 
	small town but rundown and obsolete now.  the place is charred and 
	the grounds are littered with rubble - as if there'd been a fire 
	there long ago.

	The entrance to the plant is boarded up and plastered with "NO 
	TRESPASSING" signs.  Many of the boards are missing, providing 
	easy access for the scores of vandals who had torn through there 
	at one time or another.

	There are no windows at ground level but the top of the building 
	is lined with many multi-paned frames; all of them are either 
	cracked or missing.

	JESSE'S CAR pulls into frame and he and LISA get out and look the 
	place over.

						JESSE
			What is this place?

						LISA
					(excidedly)
			Remember in the diary - Nancy said
			that she kept finding herself in 
			a boiler room?  Fred Krueger
			worked here.  It's an old power-
			plant - a steam generator!

	She pulls out several papers and hands them to Jesse.

						LISA
			Here.

						JESSE
			What's this?

	ON THE PAPERS

	Xeroxes of newspaper articles.

	The HEADLINE reads:  "SPRINGWOOD SLASHER ARRESTED!"

						LISA (O.C.)
			I did some reading up on our friend,
			Fred Krueger.

	Jesse leafs through the papers.  Each one is a front page from a 
	local newspaper.

	HEADLINE: "KRUEGER FREED ON TECHNICALITY!  D.A. RESIGNS"

	HEADLINE: "JUSTICE DONE - KRUEGER KILLED BY MOB!  SPRINGWOOD
		     SLASHER DIES IN HELLISH INFERNO"

	Jesse sucks in his breath.

	INT. ENTRANCEWAY, ABANDONED POWERPLANT - DAY

	Jesse and Lisa climb between a pair of boards and step inside.

	ON LISA

	She walks toward the center of the plant, fascinated.

	INT. POWERPLANT

	We can see the remnants of a large boiler room.  Big steel pipes 
	jut out of the floor in a tangle of elbows and valves and a 
	clutter of debris.  A one-story holdig tank rises above a concrete 
	pit and is met on top by a mze of catwalks, just under the 
	windows.

	Although most of the ceiling has burned away, the interior is 
	surprisingly intact for a derelict building and the overhead light 
	distracts form any intrinsic creepiness the place would possess 
	after dark.

	Jesse steps in behind her.

						LISA
					(solemnly)
			He kidnapped twenty kids and brought
			them all here to die.

	She gives herself a chill but shakes it off and turns to Jesse.

						LISA
			So, you feeling anything?

						JESSE
			What do you mean?

						LISA
			I thought you might be able to make
			a connection.

	Jesse shrugs his shoulders and puts his hands to the side of his 
	mouth.

						JESSE
					(calling)
			Any ghosts in here?

						LISA
			C'mon, cut it out.

						JESSE
			Well, what am I supposed to do?

						LISA
			I don't know.  Concentrate or some-
			thing.

	Jesse shifts his legs and stares up at the ceiling.  He closes his 
	eyes.

						JESSE
					(still concentrating)
			I feel like a jerk.

						LISA
			Shhh.  Just concentrate.

	Jesse walks around in a small circle, keeping hsi head up and his 
	eyes closed.

						LISA
			Anything?

						JESSE
					(shakes his head)
			Uh-uh.
					(a beat)
			Wait...

	He walks slowly across the room, almost in a trance, until he 
	comes to a board leaning up against the foot of the mesh-iron 
	stairway that leads up to the catwalks.

	ON THE BOARD

	As his hand reaches over to touch it.

	ON LISA

	stepping over next to Jesse.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	He pulls the board away.

	A LARGE RAT, in her nest, WITH HER YOUNG, SNARLS at him.

	Jesse and Lisa jump into each other's arms.

	EXT. ABANDONED POWERPLANT - LATE AFTERNOON

	JESSE and LISA walk along the outskirts of the building to a 
	pretty cluster of shade trees nearby.  Lisa hoists herself up on a 
	boulder and looks at the building.

						JESSE
			Disappointed?

						LISA
			About what?

						JESSE
			About not finding any bogey men?

						LISA
					(smiles)
			I'll get over it.

	She is disappointed - She wanted to find some bogey men.

	Jesse comes up close to her and they stare at each other.

						LISA
					(finally)
			You are sensitive.  I mean you sensed
			that the rat was there.  And I can
			feel something about you.  Sometimes
			I feel like I know what you're thinking.

	Jesse moves in closer an puts his arms on her shoulders.

						JESSE
					(suggestively)
			Yeah?

						LISA
					(ignoring the 
					 suggestion)
			Maybe it only happens when you're
			sleeping - that's the way it was with
			Nancy, wasn't it?

						JESSE
			Now, there's an idea we can take off 
			on.  Maybe we should drive out to the
			beach tonight and lay out a couple
			of blankets and...
					(winks)
			Until I fall asleep.

						LISA
					(slyly)
			Maybe we can do that.  Strictly 
			scientific, of course.

	Jesse moves in until their lips are almost touching.

						JESSE
			Nancy went bonkers from this thing.
			You wouldn't be afraid of being out
			on the beach with a potential 
			lunatic?

						LISA
			Ghostbusters are fearless.

	They kiss.  Not little friendly pecks like before -- this is the 
	real thing.  Jesse drops his arms to her waist and she opens her 
	legs so that he can get in real close.

	Suddenly, Jesse groans in pain and stands upright, tearing from 
	their embrace.  For the briefest instant, we can see protrusions 
	grow and subside on his forehead and the side of his face.

						LISA
			What is it - What's wrong?

						JESSE
					(holding his stomach)
			Whoa!

						LISA
			What is it?

						JESSE
			I don't know - a sharp pain.

	Lisa watches his helplessly.  Finally, the agony lifts from 
	Jesse's face.  He straightens up.

						JESSE
			It's gone now.

						LISA
			Oh, Jesse...

	Lisa puts her arms around him.

						LISA
			Jesse, this is no good.  You've got
			to get some sleep, Jesse.  You've 
			got to get some sleep.

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - JESSE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Jesse is in bed, tossing restlessly adn panting heavily.  He is 
	drenched with sweat and continues to perspire profusely as he sits 
	up and turns on his bedside lamp.

	A thunderhead is RUMBLING somewhere nearby.

	The PLASTIC SHADE OF THE LAMP is melting.

	He scans the room picking out various indications of the intense 
	heat that is surrounding him; A CANDLE on his bookshelf collapses 
	into a puddle of wax, the LAMINATED TOP OF THE NIGHT-TABLE is 
	bubbling, an UNSHEATHED RECORD ALBUM hangs over the corner of the 
	desk, his PORTABLE STEREO has caved in the center - a Daliesque 
	tableau.

	SOUND OVER: SCRAPING

	Jesse gets out of bed, crossing to the desk.  The scraping sound 
	intensifes.

	CLOSE ON THE DRAWER

	as Jesse opens it.  Inside, THE GLOVE, fingers moving, 
	independently, unattached, scraping little cuts in the bottom of 
	the drawer.

	ON JESSE

	slamming the drawer shut.

	SOUND OVER: A SWISHING SOUND, FOLLOWED BY A THUMP, AGAIN AND AGAIN

	UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

	JESSE, barefoot and wearing only a pair of jeans and an unbuttoned 
	shirt, steps up to the door to Angela's room.  The sound is coming 
	from inside.  He opens the door.

	ANGELA is standing in the middle of the floor, in her nightgown, 
	seemingly oblivious to the heat.  She is jumping rope and 
	chanting:

						ANGELA
			One, two, Freddy's coming for you.

	ON JESSE, PETRIFIED

						ANGELA (O.C.)
			Three, four, better lock your door.

	ON ANGELA

	She sees her brother staring at her.  She doesn't stop jumping but 
	smiles and continues her jingle:

						ANGELA
			Five, six, grab your crucifix...

	Jesse SLAMS the door shut.

	KITCHEN

	Jesse enters, looks out the windows.  A huge bolt of LIGHTNING 
	RIPS through the night sky; a multiple flash f blue light strobes 
	through the kitchen followed by a CRACK of intense THUNDER.

	ANOTHER FLASH OF LIGHTNING cuts across the kitchen itself, 
	SHATTERING SOME DISHES on the counter-top, leaving a plume of 
	BLACK SMOKE.

	EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT

	The rain continues to come down in buckets.  Jesse enters shot and 
	walks, unprotected in his drenched jeans and shirt and seemingly 
	without any knowledge of where he is going.

	The streets are totally empty.

	EXT. DON'S PLACE - NIGHT

	A seedy tavern on a badly lit corner.

	JESSE steps into frame.

	He stares at the place before stepping up to he door.

	INT. DON'S PLACE - NIGHT

	The toughest looking bar in the entire city.  The place is packed 
	with PROSTITUTES, PIMPS, TRAVELING SALESMEN, a couple of 
	TRANSVESTITES and a generous delegation of the leather and chain 
	contingency.

	Jesse enters and crosses to the bar amid a few stares.  He sits on 
	a stool.

	The bartender draws a cold beer and presents it to Jesse.  As the 
	bartender turns away, Jesse reaches for the glass.

	A HAND slaps down on his wrist and holds it tightly.

	He looks up.

	COACH SCHNEIDER is standing over him.  He's wearing a muscle 
	shirt, a gold chain around his neck and he has a sick grin on his 
	face.

	INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

	JESSE is barefoot, jogging arund the outer edge of the gym floor 
	and looking as if he's about to collapse from exhaustion.

	ON SCHNEIDER

	Leaning against a wall of the gym, watching Jesse run.

	As Jesse comes around for another lap, Schneider reaches out and 
	grabs him, throwing him into a wall of folding wooden bleachers.  
	Jesse is dazed, ready to drop.

						SCHNEIDER
					(barking)
			Hit the showers.

	INT. BOYS LOCKER ROOM - SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT

	Jesse turns on one of the faucets and lets the hot water hit him 
	full on.

	INT. COACH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	SCNEIDER turns to a huge, padlocked cabinet on the wall.

	He unlocks it and opens the doors.  It is filled with a variety of 
	athletic equipment:  dumbbells, jump-ropes and volley balls, etc.

	Schneider selects a pair of jump-ropes from the cabinet and sets 
	them down on his desk.

	A distinct PING makes him look up.  He goes to the door and looks 
	out into the hall.

	SHOWER ROOM

	Jesse continues showering.

	INT. COACH'S OFFICE

	Schneider turns back to his office.  There is ANOTHER PING.

	A TENNIS RACQUET hanging on the wall has two broken strings.  TWO 
	MORE STRINGS SMOKE, THEN SNAP with a ping.

	A BASKETBALL leaps off a shelf of the equipmnt cabinet and bounce 
	on the floor at Schneider's feet.

	Schneider bends down to pick it up and TWO MORE BALLS jump out 
	onto the floor.

	A FOURTH BALL flies out and knocks over a TROPHY on his desk.

	Schneider hits the deck when a DUMBBELL streaks across the office 
	and SLAMS into the window, cracking the thick wired glass.

	ON SCHNEIDER

	he makes his way to the cabinet by crawling along the floor as 
	BASKETBALLS, VOLLEYBALLS, even a MEDICINE BALL fly over his head.

	He reaches up to close the cabinet doors.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	A JUMP-ROPE on the desk unravels like a harpoon line and wraps an 
	end of itself around Schneider's wrist.  The other end pulls hard 
	and yanks Schneider off balance.

	He reaches up to close the cabinet doors.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	A JUMP-ROPE on the desk unravels like a harpoon line and wraps an 
	end of itself around Schneider's wrist.  The other end pulls hard 
	and yanks Schneider off balance.

	As he reaches with his free arm to unwrap his wrist, the SECOND 
	ROPE rockets off the desk top and secures itself to his other 
	wrist.

	hThe office door opens by itself.  The ropes drag Schneider 
	screaming from the room.

	SHOWER ROOM

	JESSE turns as the shower head next to the one he is using, 
	gurgles and suddenly comes on full.  And suddenly, all the showers 
	are on, spewing water and steam.

	We hear Schneider's screams as he is dragged into the room, 
	through great puddles of water and against the tiled wall opposite 
	Jesse.  The showers on this side are OFF.

	The boy watches in horror as the ropes shoot up to two adjacent 
	shower nozzles and hoist the Coach into a helpless spread-eagle, 
	facing the wall.  His clothes shear from his body like sheets of 
	tissue paper.

	A STACK OF TOWELS

	Comes to life, snapping in mid-air at Schneider's butt and back.  
	As they hit him, they draw blood.

	ON JESSE

	as the room fills with great clouds of steam until he is nearly 
	obscured; just a dark human form in the corner of the shower room.

	ANOTHER ANGLE ON SCHNEIDER

	as a figure in a green and red sweater and a battered fedora, cuts 
	through the clouds, CACKLING and throwing his weapon-arm back like 
	a World Series pitcher about to lob a fast ball.

	Schneider screams painfully as the knives cut four long tears in 
	him, starting at the top of his naked back, cutting through his 
	flesh.

	The weapon arm STRIKES AGAIN.  Schneider screams, goes limp.

	WIDE-ANGLE: SCHNEIDER

	BLOOD begins to flow out of all the shower heads on Schneider's 
	side.  Schneider hangs limply from the shower heads.

	ON THE MURDERER

	CAMERA DOLLIES IN FAST to reveal it is JESSE.  He screams.

	Jesse lifts his hand into frame.  He is wearing Freddy's bloodied 
	glove.

						JESSE
			No...Oh God, no...

	He slowly drops to his knees, sloshing in a crimson puddle, and 
	stares up to the heavens.

						JESSE
					(screaming)
			No!!!

									     SMASH CUT TO:

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

	We hear the DOORBELL RINGING repeatedly until the lights flick on 
	and DAD hurries to the door, wrapping a robe over his pajamas.

	HIS POV AS HE OPENS THE DOOR

	TWO POLICEMEN in rain slickers stand on either side of Jesse.  he 
	is naked but is wrapped in a blanket.  His hair is soaked and 
	dripping over his face.

						1st POLICEMAN
			This belong to you?

	Dad can't believe what he's looking at.  He just nods his head.

	The 2nd Policeman gives Jesse a slight push across the threshold.  
	He stumbles into the house.

						1st POLICEMAN
			We found him wandering out on the Highway, 
			naked.  Keep a leash on him, will ya?

										     CUT TO:

	KITCHEN - A TEA KETTLE WHISTLING

	MOM takes the kettle from the stove and pours it into a mug.  She 
	steeps the teabag as she crosses to the table and

	JESSE

	Wide awake, holding the blanket tightly around his neck, takes the 
	cup from his mother.

	DAD paces the floor angrily.

						DAD
			Okay, we're gonna put our cards on the
			table, here and now.  There's not going
			to be any retribution - no fire and 
			brimstone.  I only have two questions
			and you'll answer them and we'll all go
			to bed, okay?

	Jesse nods weakly.

						DAD
			Okay. What are you taking and who are
			you getting it from?

	Jesse snorts and shakes his head ironically.

						JESSE
			I'm not taking drugs, Dad.
					(to Mom)
			Can I go to bed now?

						MOM
					(touches his cheek
					 tenderly)
			Sure...go ahead.

	Dad tries to burn a hole through him with his eyes as Jesse gets 
	up from the table and leaves the room.

	As the double-hinged doors slap clsoed behind him, Dad turns to 
	Mom without a change of expression.

						DAD
					(no question about it)
			He's on something.

	EXT. WALSH HOUSE - MORNING

	DAD is standing on a ladder, unbolting a set of security bars from 
	the windows.

	He watches from above as JESSE runs out the door, followed by MOM.

						MOM
			Jesse, please, let's talk about this!

						JESSE
					(pleading)
			I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.

	Jesse walks over to his car and climbs in.

	Mom turns to Dad who is watching the scene curiously.

						MOM
			He needs professional help.  I think
			we should take him to a psychiatrist.

						DAD
					(incensed)
			Are you nuts or something?  What
			the hell is that going to do?

						MOM
			I don't know!  I just know he needs
			help and we don't know how to give
			it to him.

	Dad shifts on the ladder and begins to protest.

						MOM
					(squelching it)
			Don't fight me on this.

	She stomps back toward the house.

						DAD
					(calling after her)
			He needs a kick in the but, is what
			he needs.  He needs a methodone 
			clinic!

	She throws back a dirty look.

						MOM
			Oh, blow it out your ass, Ken.

	With that, Dad loses his footing on the ladder and drops down 
	several rungs.

	EXT. ROAD - DAY

	Jesse's car travels slowly and turns onto a tree-lined street.

	INSIDE

	JESSE drives silently with LISA looking over at him, upset.

						LISA
					(upset)
			Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?

						JESSE
					(staring straight ahead)
			I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.

						LISA
					(undeterred)
			you didn't say more than two words to
			me the whole way here.  You had another
			nightmare, didn't you?

						JESSE
			yeah, I had a bad night.

						LISA
			You want to talk about it?

						JESSE
			My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom
			thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I
			don't agree with her.

	EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

	as Jesse's car pulls into the lot.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	as they turn a corner.  Jesse jams on the brakes.

	THEIR POV - THE GYMNASIUM WING

	in the distance.  A crowd of STUDENTS is gathered in a ring about 
	three-deep outside the doors leading to the practice fields.

	IN THE CAR

						JESSE
			Oh God.

	He throws open the door, jumps out and runs toward the crowd.

	Bewildered, Lisa does likewise, running after him.

	As they get closer, they can see that the entire area is cordoned 
	of with red plastic ribbons.

	SEVERAL POLICEMEN and OFFICIALS are coming in and out of the 
	building.

	A TEACHER is trying to disperse the students, clapping his hands 
	together and pushing through the rubber-neckers.

						TEACHER
			Okay gang, let's move along.

	Jesse stops at the edge of the barricade cranes his neck to see 
	what's going on.

	GRADY spots Jesse and runs over to his side.  Jesse is turning 
	white as he watches the scene and listens to Grady's recap:

						GRADY
			Holy shit, man.  Where have you been?
			Fuckin' Schneider got wasted last night.

	Jesse swallows hard to regain his composure.  Lisa arrives at his 
	side.

						JESSE
			Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.

						GRADY
					(ignores him)
			He must've been working late and some
			fruitcake came in and sliced him up
			like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left
			bloody footprints all over the...

	Jesse clamps his hand over his mouth and breaks for some bushes 
	against the building.

	Grady looks at a horrified Lisa and gives a puzzled shrug.

	INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY

	ON THE FOOD LINE

	LISA and KERRY are on the lunch line, sliding their trays along 
	the rails.  Kerry is wearing a walkman with the volume truned way 
	up - we can almost make out the song.

						KERRY
			That was something this morning, huh?
			About Schneider, I mean.

	Lisa nods and takes a plate of macaroni and cheese from one of the 
	KITCHEN STAFF.  She doesn't want to talk about it.

						KERRY
			Jesse sure took it bad, didn't he?

	Lisa shrugs and moves her tray away from Kerry's, toward the 
	CASHIER.

	Kerry picks up a piece of cake from a shelf and slides ehr tray 
	down until she's next to Lisa again.

	IN THE DINING ROOM

	JESSE is sitting at a table, a tray of food in front of him, 
	untouched.

	He glances up at GRADY as he sits down next to him and starts 
	digging in.


						GRADY
					(with his mouth full)
			Look, I'm sorry about Schneider, man.
			I didn't know you were so close.

	Jesse doesn't qualify that with a response.

						GRADY
			You want to go out to a movie or something
			tonight?  Get your mind off things?

	Jesse shakes his head.

	Lisa comes over to the table with her tray and sits down next to 
	Jesse.

	Kerry follows and sits next to Grady.

						KERRY
			Hi, guys.
					(to Grady, 
					 coquettishly)
			Hi, Ronny.  You going to Lisa's party
			tomorrow night?

						GRADY
					(without looking up
					 from his food)
			I can't.  I'm grounded.

						KERRY	
			How come?

						GRADY
			For throwin' my grandmother down a
			flight of stairs.

	Kerry, taking him seriously, nods gravely.

	Lisa looks at Jesse's tray of untouched food.

						LISA
					(to Jesse)
			You should eat something - you'll feel
			better.

						JESSE
			I'm not hungry.

						LISA
			I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure
			it out, you know.  We can figure it out
			together.

						JESSE
			There's nothing to figure out.

						GRADY
					(to Lisa, disgustedly)
			You're wasting your time, the guy's a
			basket case.

						JESSE
			Shut up, Grady.

	Grady pushes his tray aside.

						GRADY
			You want me to shut up?  Fine, I'll 
			shut up, that's fine.  See you around,
			buddy.

	Grady gets up and storms away from the table.

	Lisa, deeply pained, looks at Jesse.  Jesse avoids her stare until 
	he just drops his head into his hands and tries not to cry in 
	front of his friends.

	He composes himself quickly and digs his fork into his lunch, 
	choking down some macaroni.

	INT. LISA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	LISA, her MOTHER and FATHER are sitting, eating dinner.  Lisa's 
	mind is not at the table with her.

						MRS. POLETTI
					(to Lisa)
			Bought some nice strawberries at the 
			farm today.  We can have some short
			cake for your friends tomorrow.

	Lisa looks up an dsmiles blandly.

						MRS. POLETTI
			I also wangled a promise out of your
			father.

	ON MR. POLETTI

	He scowls slightly.

						LISA
					(politely)
			What's that?

						MRS. POLETTI
			We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow
			night.

						LISA
			You're going out?

						MRS. POLETTI
			We're going to bed.

	She looks at her husband.

						MRS. POLETTI
			Early.

	EXT. WALSH HOUSE - NIGHT

	Quiet.  The lights inside are all out.

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

	We hear FOOTSTEPS and we TRAVEL with the sound along the floor to 
	the foot of the basement steps.

	INTRUDER'S POV

	as he climbs the steps and approaches the door to the main part of 
	the house.

	THE CAMERA is moving faster now, leaping the top steps and 
	CRASHING through the doorway and onto the foyer floor.

	It crosses the FOYER adn begins climbing the stairs to the bedroom 
	level.  It stops at Angela's room and opens the door.

	ANGELA sleeps soundly, peacefully.

	It crosses over to the bed, a menacing SHADOW creeps over her 
	form.  The taloned glove pulls down on the blankets and she shifts 
	position in the center of the bed, innocent and vulnerable.

	We see the SHADOW of the intruder on the wall...it moves in close 
	to the sleeping child and emits a guttural, inhuman VOICE:

						INTRUDER (O.C.)
			Wake up, little girl...

	Her eyes flutter open.  She looks up at the intruder and smiles.

						ANGELA
					(sleepily)
			What time is it?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	We now see that it's JESSE standing over her.  he's in his 
	underpants, drenched with sweat and hunched over as if all the 
	muscles in his body were twisted around each other.

	The sound of Angela's voice softens him.  He slowly straghtens up 
	and looks about the room as if wondering how he got there.

						JESSE
					(himself again)
			It's late...go back to sleep.

	She nods and closes her eyes.

	Jesse starts to pull the covers back over her and stops suddenly.

	HIS POV

	His right hand is wearing the GLOVE.

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - JESSE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	The desk lamp and a late movie on the T.V. are the only sources of 
	light in the room.

	We see that the bed is rumpled and empty and we PAN across the 
	room, to JESSE, sitting on the floor in front of the door, knees 
	up against his chest, trying with all his strength to stay awake.  
	He has a mug of black coffee in his hand and a pot of java at his 
	side.

	He tops off his cup and reaches into the breast pocket of his 
	shirt, withdrawing a small vial of pills.

	A BOTTLE OF NO-DOZ

	He rips the cap off with his teeth and dumps half the bottle into 
	his coffee.

	EXT. WALSH HOUSE - MORNING

	A dark, dreary day.  There are no morning sounds except for the 
	SQUEAKING of an old rattle-trap bicycle as an overweight PAPER BOY 
	swings by and lobs the morning edition over the lawn.

	The paper skids off the front steps and into the garden.

	INT. WALSH HOUSE - FOYER - MORNING

	JESSE walks down the steps.  He looks ragged and exhausted and 
	worse that ever.

	OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN

	He stops before going through the double-hinged door to push his 
	hair back and forces a well rested, easy-going guise.

	IN THE KITCHEN

	DAD and ANGELA are sitting at the table.  MOM is pouring some 
	coffee into a couple of cups.

	JESSE enters.

						JESSE
			Morning.

						MOM
			How'd you sleep, honey, okay?

						JESSE
			Fine.

	Mom gives him a quick glance.

						MOM
			You're looking a little better today.

	DAD looks at Jesse's pale skin, the light stubble on his chin and 
	his dark, bloodshot eyes and turns to Mom as if she's nuts.

	EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

	The entire pool area has been done up to the max.  Japanese 
	lanterns have been strung up above the fence, a long table, 
	covered with festively arranged salads and condiments, stretches 
	across the patio in front of the sliders and a Benny Goodman dance 
	tune is blaring through some outdoor speakers.  An all-too-bright 
	underwater light makes the blue water shimmer crystal-clear.

	A score of nubile GIRLS in scanty swimsuits and athletic GUYS in 
	cut-offs and trunks, scamper around, eating, swimming and horsing 
	around.

	ON MR. POLETTI

	Standing over the gas grill, wearing a "Kiss the Cook" chefs hat 
	and apron, cooking up a mess of hanburgers and hot dogs.

	ON MRS. POLETTI AND LISA

	stepping out of the house through the sliders, carrying more 
	plates of food outside.

	A BOY

	bounces once on the diving board and CANNONBALLS into the center 
	of the pool, SPLASHING everything within a fifteen foot radius 
	including,

	MR. POLETTI

	who spins around from the grill, annoyed.

						MR. POLETTI
			Hey, watch it there!

	LISA turns to her mother, mortified.

	Mrs. Poletti hands her the platter she is holding and gives Lisa a 
	reassuring squeeze on the shoulder before leaving her side and 
	crossing toward her husband.

	Lisa turns her attention to JESSE, at the far corner of the patio, 
	sitting in a lounger, alone.  He looks worried and detached.

	She looks back toward the grill.

	MRS. POLETTI is pulling her husband away, against his will.  He 
	finally relents and beckons a BOY over.  He turns his spatula over 
	to him, surrenders his chef's hat and allows Lisa's mom to escort 
	him back toward the house.

	JESSE, LISA'S POV

	He finally gets up and crosses toward the cabanas, going inside 
	and shutting the door.

	BACK TO LISA

	as her mother and father approach.

						MRS. POLETTI
			We're going up to bed now.

						LISA
					(gratefully)
			Thanks, Mom.

	Mr. Poletti clearly doesn't like this arrangement.  He looks 
	behind him at all the horny young boys and turns back to Lisa.

						MR. POLETTI
					(sternly)
			Twelve-thiry, Miss.  No later.

						LISA
					(nods agreeably)
			Twelve-thirty.  I promise.

	Mrs. Poletti takes her husband by the arm again and leads him up 
	to the sliders.  He turns around before going through.

						MR. POLETTI
			And don't forget to lock the gate.

						LISA
					(nods)
			Goodnight, Daddy.

	Mr. Poletti is half-led, half-pushed through the doorway.  mrs. 
	Poletti pulls the slider closed behind them.

	INT. CABANA - NIGHT

	A roomy dressing area with an open shower stall at the back.  
	There's a wide, wooden bench along one wall, covered with clothing 
	and towels.

	JESSE stands in the center of the room, putting his pants on.  He 
	is shirtless and shoeless.

	SOUND OVER:  A KNOCK ON THE DOOR

						LISA (O.S.)
			Jesse?

	Jesse hesitates, uncomfortable.

						JESSE
			Be out in a minute.

	EXT. CABANA

	Lisa waits for Jesse.  Finally, he unlatches the door.  his shirt 
	is on, unbuttoned.  Lisa steps into the cabana.

	INT. CABANA

	Lisa shuts the door behind her.  The two look at each other a 
	moment.  Then Jesse looks away and continues buttoning his shirt.

						JESSE
			I think I better go.  I'm just not into
			it tonight.  I'm sorry.

						LISA
			Why won't you talk to me?

						JESSE
			Will you leave me alone?  Please.

	Jesse crosses to the bench and sits to put on his shoes.

						LISA
			You're not being fair to me.  I'm 
			worried about you and I want to 
			help you get through this thing.

						JESSE
			What are you gonna do?  How are you 
			gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.
					(breaking down)
			I don't want to have you watch me fall
			apart.

	Lisa goes to Jesse.  She puts a comforting arm on his shoulder.

						LISA
			It's okay, Jesse.

	Jesse takes her hand and holds it tight.  She sits beside him.

						JESSE
					(choked)
			I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to 
			stay awake - I'm ruining your party. 
			They're gonna put me away for sure.

						LISA
			We'll figure it out together.  We'll 
			stay up all night if we have to.  I
			won't let anything happen to you.

	They look into each others eyes.  Lisa kisses him ever so gently, 
	then again.  he kisses her.  Their kisses grow hungrier.

	Love conquers fear and they embrace fully, kissing passionately.

	POOLSIDE

	THREE BOYS are huddled together, looking up at the Poletti's 
	bedroom window.

						BOY ONE
			Any second, now...

	THE BEDROOM WINDOW, THEIR POV

	The lights FLICK OUT.

						BOY ONE (O.C.)
					(quietly)
			Party time.

	ON THE WET BAR

	Someone reaches over to the stereo, pops out the Benny Goodman

	speakers.

	ON KERRY

	In the pool, up to her neck with a HUNK.  They both look up as the

	At the sound of the music, Mr. Poletti sits up in bed, angrily.

	Mrs. Poletti puts an arm on his shoulder.

						MRS. POLETTI
					(quietly)
			Let them have their fun, Honey.

	Mrs. poletti pulls out a pair of earplugs and hands them to Mr. 
	Poletti, who grumbles, sticks them in his ear and drops back down 
	into his pillow.

	Somebody switches off the lights to general applause.

	BACK TO KERRY AND THE HUNK

	They are in a steamy embrace when the underwater lights go out.

	The rest of her suit pops up out of the water.

	ON SOME BUSHES

	as a COUPLE pulls out a red wagon, stashed in the shrubbery and 
	loaded with beer.

	INT. CABANA - NIGHT

	JESSE and LISA rolling around on the floor, a lot of heavy 
	petting; not doing it but serious, heated stuff just the same.

	HIS HAND, wrapped around Lisa's wrist, pinning it gently to the 
	floor.

	ON LISA

	Her eyes closed; feeling him - definitely feeling him.

	CLOSE TWO-SHOT, JESSE

	Jesse is about to take down Lisa's swimsuit top when an ungodly 
	long iridescent serpent-like TONGUE flicks a foot out of his 
	mouth, wiggles and flicks back in.

	Jesse moans lasciviously, not his own voice.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jesse pushes himself away from Lisa and scrambles to his feet.  
	Lisa, unaware of what happened, is puzzled and upset.

	ON LISA

	sitting up on the floor.

						LISA
			What's wrong?

	Jesse tucks in his shirt and buttons his pants.  he is visibly 
	shaken.

						JESSE
			I'll see you.

	Lisa just looks at him, helplessly.

	He slips out the cabana door and shuts it.

	ON LISA

	she gets up slowly.  She's profoundly worried.

	INT. GRADY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Grady is sleeping on his back, dead to the world.

	Suddenly, a hand clamps down over his mouth.

	A light flicks on.

	LONGER ANGLE:  GRADY'S BEDROOM

	It's JESSE.  A window is open in the B.G., teh curtains in 
	disarray.

	He lifts his hand from Grady's mouth and Grady scrambles out of 
	bed.

						GRADY
					(hoarsely)
			Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out
			of me!

						JESSE
			I'm sorry...

						GRADY
			What are you doing here?

						JESSE
			You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.

						GRADY
			Are you nuts or something?

						JESSE
			Listen to me, Grady, this is serious.
			Something really weird is happening.  It
			started out like just bad dreams but it's
			getting real bad.

	Grady is tired and cranky and he doesn't want ot hear this.

						GRADY
			Aw, will you get out of here!  Go and
			take a sleeping pill or something...

	He flops back down on his bed and puts his arm over his eyes.

						GRADY
			In fact, take a whole bottle and do the 
			world a favor.

	Jesse sits on the edge of the bed.

						JESSE
			I killed Schneider, Grady...

	Grady lifts his arm from his eyes and stares at Jesse 
	preposterously.

						JESSE
					(nods)
			Only it wasn't me - I was there but
			it was like something inside of me,
			moving me around.  Then last night 
			it made me go into my sister's room 
			and tonight, with Lisa in the cabana. 
			We were...on the floor - I felt it
			happening again.

	He grabs Grady's arm.

						JESSE
			It wanted me to kill them, Grady!

	Grady continues his dumbfounded stare.

						GRADY
					(finally)
			You're fucked in the head.

						JESSE
			I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds
			crazy.  But, there's something trying 
			to get into my body.

						GRADY
					(sneers)
			The only thing trying to get into your
			body is female and waiting for you on
			a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep
			with me.  Go figure.

						JESSE
			Look, I don't care if you believe me
			or not...

						GRADY
			I believe you.  You had some scary
			dreams, okay?

						JESSE
					(frustrated)
			No!
					(shakes his head)
			I don't know - everything's all mixed
			up.
					(suddenly angry)
			What difference does it make?  I'm in
			trouble here.  I need your help.

	Grady lets that sink in.

						GRADY
					(softer)
			Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me 
			to do?

						JESSE
			Just watch me.  If anything weird 
			happens - like if I start dreaming 
			weird or try to walk out of here, 
			you gotta try to bring me out of it. 
			his me over the head if you have to.
			Just don't let me leave.

	Grady looks down at the floor, sighs, and nods his head.

						JESSE
			And Grady...

	Grady looks up.

						JESSE
			Don't fall asleep!

	EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

	The underwater lights are still off, the music has calmed down a 
	bit and most of the KIDS are more into necking than swimming.

	TWO BODIES are rolled up in a blanket together.  From a short 
	SQUEAL, we can deduce that it's KERRY and her HUNK.

	The BAR-B-QUE BOY has remained steadfast at his post although his 
	GIRLFRIEND has joined him and he's paying more attention to her 
	than the hotdogs on the grill.

	ON LISA

	She sitting on one of the lounges, her eyes are red from crying.  
	She's being comforted by a girlfriend, PATTY.

						PATTY
			Why don't you just call him?

						LISA
					(tearfully)
			He won't talk to me.

						PATTY
			Well, you're not doing him or yourself
			any good sitting here and worrying.

	Lisa looks at her friend.

						LISA
			I shoud go see him, but...I don't know,

					(encouragingly)
			Go ahead.  I'll hold down the fort.

			Thanks, Patty.  You're a pal.

	INT. GRADY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Grady is sitting up in bed, staring at the T.V.  He turns to 
	JESSE, slumped in a nearby chair, asleep.

	Grady switches off the TV with the remote.

						GRADY
			Sweet dreams, buddy.

	Grady turns off the READING LIGHT by the bed.  He gives a final 
	look at Jesse before he pushes the whole thing out of his mind 
	with a disgusted wave of his arm and lays back down.

	ON JESSE

	Suddenly, his eyes open widely.

						JESSE
			Grady?

	Grady MUMBLES an obscenity and turns over on his side to face 
	Jesse.

						GRADY
			What?
	
						JESSE
			It's happening again.

	Grady turns the reading light back on in time to see Jesse DOUBLE 
	OVER and curl up in obviously incredible pain, falling to his 
	knees.  He flails out as if 1000 volts were going through his body 
	and begins to choke on his tongue.

	Grady scrambles out of bed and dances around Jesse, not knowing 
	what to do.

	ON JESSE'S HAND

	as he raises it and his fingers spread widely apart.

	Four steel RAZOR-KNIVES tear out from withing the tips of Jesse's 
	fingers like long, bloody switchblades!

	GRADY stands by helplessly as Jesse WRITHES.

	And then it is like some crazed beast in Jesse's gut, tearing its 
	way out of his skin like someone stepping through a thick, latex 
	film.

	As his skin peels away, thousands of capillaries pull apart, 
	spraying blood everywhere in a fine, almost powdery mist.

	The transformation is almost complete when FRED KRUEGER's body 
	steps out of the red cloud.  All that is left of Jesse is his 
	SCREAMING FACE, plastered like a grisly ruber mask over Freddy's 
	own disfigured features.

	Grady backs away toward the door.

						GRADY
					(screaming)
			No!  No!  No!

	ON FREDDY

	He stands up with an evil smile, all there now, and puts on his 
	battered hat.

	ANGLE: GRADY'S BEDROOM

	Grady tries desperately to get out, but the door won't open.  
	Freddy cackles evilly as he cuts off Grady's screams by grabbing 
	his throat with his unarmed hand.  he pushes Grady up against the 
	door and lifts him off the floor like he was hanging a picture.

	We hear MUFFLED CALLS from outside the door - the off-camera cries 
	of concerned PARENTS.

	THE DOORKNOB RATTLES

	as they try to get in the room to check on their son.

	BOOM, BOOM, BOOM!

	a fist, hammering against the door behind Grady's head - his 
	father trying to get in.

						MR. GRADY (O.C.)
			What's going on?  Open the door, Ronny!

	FREDDY draws back his knife-hand and prepares to plunge it into 
	Grady's stomach like he was spearing a pot roast.

	OUTSIDE THE DOOR

	MR. and MRS. GRADY, in their nightclothes.  Mrs. Grady stands with 
	her hands over her mouth as Mr. Grady grabs the know again and 
	BANGS his fist repeatedly against teh door.

	ON FREDDY

	Throwing force into his cutting arm.  We CUT before impact to:

	OUTSIDE THE DOOR

	We hear Grady SCREAM as the steel blades cut through his body and 
	poke out through the door like it was made of balsa.  They wiggle 
	slightly to pull free and are retracted with an ungodly SQUEAK.

	Mrs. Grady screams.

						MR. GRADY
			My God.

	Mr. Grady throws his shoulder with all his might against the door.  
	A second excruciating SCREAM inside, and the knives cut through 
	the door, inches from Mr. Grady's head.  When they pull out, blood 
	is soaking through the knife holes - it looks as if the door 
	itself is bleeding.

	ON GRADY

	breathing his last few gasps.

	ON GRADY'S PARENTS

	They watch in stunned horror.

	ON GRADY

	He sinks slowly to the floor, dead.

	Freddy watches as his victim slides into a heap on the floor.  
	Only we see now that it isn't Freddy anymore but Jesse again, 
	panting exhaustedly and dripping Grady's blood from just under his 
	elbow to the sharp points of the razor-tipped glove he wears on 
	his hand.

	THE DOOR is budging open against Grady's body - a little more with 
	each crash of Mr. Grady's shoulder against the other side.

	Jesse is coming to - himself again, and he views what he has done 
	to his best friend with terror crazed eyes.

	is eye catches his own reflection in a full length mirror on the 
	wall.  The image reflected is of FREDDY.

						JESSE
			No!
					(backing away from 
					 the body)
			No!  No!  No!
					(screaming toward the
					 mirror)
			You son of a bitch!  You killed him!

	Jesse hurls the glove at the mirror, cracking it.  Freddy's 
	mocking image, however, remains.  The last SOUND we hear is a 
	demonic mix of Jesse's own screams and Freddy's cackling laugh.

	INT. LISA'S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

	Lisa has changed into a white shirt and a pair of cut-offs.  She 
	hurries downstairs, buttoning up her shirt and crosses the foyer 
	floor to the door.

	She opens the door and JESSE collapses in her arms.  He is bloody, 
	bruised and his clothes are torn and dirty.

						LISA
					(frenzied)
			Jesse, God - what happened?

						JESSE
					(hyperventilating)
			I killed him!  I killed him!

	She draws him in close, trying to comfort him.  She looks at his 
	bloody arms.

						LISA
			Oh, Christ, you're hurt...

						JESSE
					(weeping now)
			I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa.
			I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's 
			inside me...

	Lisa looks around, frantically as she holds Jesse tightly against 
	her body.

						LISA
			Who, Jesse?

						JESSE
			he's just waiting to take me.  When
			I sleep.

						LISA
			Who?  Who's doing this to you?

	He looks at her as if she should know.

						JESSE
			Fred Krueger.
					(psychotically)
			He's been trying to get hold of me, 
			to use me.  He needs me to get out
			of his world into ours...He's gonna
			take me again.

						LISA
			No, Jesse.  This isn't happening.
			It's gotta be everything you've 
			taken in -- Schneider and the diary
			and the glove -- only it's all 
			mixed up.

	He pushes away from her, frustrated.

						JESSE
			No!  Christ, how can I make you 
			understand?  He tried to make me kill
			Angela last night!  Look at the blood
			on my hands!

	He begins to sob.

						JESSE
			Oh, God.  I did that to Grady...
					(suddenly coherent,
					 realizing)
			He owns me.

	Lisa puts her arms around him.  SHe strokes his head, trying to 
	calm him.
	
						LISA
			I'm not gonna let anyone take you from
			me.  There's got to be a reason.  We'll
			figure it out together.

	Suddenly, something makes Lisa stop.

						LISA
			Wait a minute!

	She leads Jesse toward the study entryway and opens the door.

						LISA
			Wait in here for me.  I'll be right back.

	Jesse goes into the study.  Lisa hurries off.

	Suddenly, the girl points toward the grill.

						GIRLFRIEND
			Hey, look!

	The kid looks over.

	HIS POV - THE GRILL

	A platter of hot dogs on an attached cutting board.  The hot dogs 
	are exploding, bursting into flames, one by one until the whole 
	plate is engulfed.

						BAR-B-QUE
			Holy Shit!

	He jumps up, picks up the flaming platter with his hands and 
	tosses it like a hot potato onto the cooking grid, slamming the 
	lid down with a CRASH.

	Some of the WITNESSES hoot and laugh and there's a scattering of 
	applause.

	Before Bar-b-que can take a bow for his bravery, his attention is 
	drawn to the sound of rapid POPPING.

			"He is evil itself.  I know now that
			I brought him into my world.  We all
			did, gave him all the energy he needed.
			Our screams were all he needed.  Now
			I will take it back - Deny him."

	She looks up at Jesse.

						LISA
			She wasn't crazy.
					(he holds up the book)
			All this really happened.
					(a beat)
			You can fight him.

	Jesse looks confussed.

						LISA
			Remember what I said?  About good
			energy and bad energy?  He thrives 
			on bad energy.  Hate, anger, fear.
			He is bad energy.
					(a beat)
			You've been afraid of him.

	Jesse suddenly winces in painand puts his hand to his stomach.

			Oh, God, he's coming back!

	with a heavy brass lamp from the top of the desk.  She SMASHES him

	inches from the blade.

	He laughs and moves for her again.

	This time she swings and hits her mark, driving the knife deep 
	into Freddy's shoulder.

	She PLUNGES the blade in, again and again, pushing him back across 
	the room.  The knife cuts long gashes but they do not bleed and 
	with each puncture of the blade, Freddy lets out a horrible laugh:

					(Jesse's voice)
			Lisa...Lisa...I love you...I love you!

	Stunned, she steps back into the center of the room.

	She raises the knife again but she is crying hysterically and just 
	doesn't have it in her.

	He starts to mouth a parting death-word but suddenly stops.

	TWO SHOT - LISA AND FREDDY

	Lisa opens her eyes.  He is stell standing there, poised for the 
	kill but he is staring at her with an odd expression - perhaps a 
	glint of recognition.

	Lisa stares back, wondering why she isn't dead yet.

	CLOSE ON FREDDY

	A frown of confusion distorts his ugly face and his lower lip 
	quivers slightly.

	Suddenly, he throws her aside like a fisherman tossing acks an 
	undersized flounder.

						FREDDY
					(as Jesse)
			Nooo...

	ON LISA

	SMASHING into the wall with force.  She slides down to the floor, 
	semi-conscious.

	BACK TO FREDDY

	he emits an agonized SCREAM and LUNGES, not at her but 

	DIVING

	through the glass doors to the pool area.

								     	     SMASH CUT TO:

	EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

	REVERSE ANGLE

	as the glass shatters into a million shimmering pieces and Freddy 
	is gone - vanishing before our eyes.

	The pool has stopped swirling although it continues to simmer.  
	KERRY, HUNK and LIFEHOOK BOY cough and shake as they are helped 
	out of the water and wrapped in towels by some FRIENDS.

	Many of the TEENS are huddled in little groups.  Some are crying, 
	others just look at the remnants of the party in disbelief.

						TEENS
			What happened?  Where'd he go.  Etc.

	Several BRAVE BOYS approach the shattered sliders with cautious 
	curiosity.

	INT. LISA'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

	MR. and MRS. POLETTI listen to the uncomfortable silence.  they 
	look at the door as it UNLATCHES with a soft SNAP.  Wary, they 
	don't move.

	EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

	One BRAVE BOY in the group kneels down and touches his hand on the 
	patio, looking or some explanation for the shattered glass.

	ON THE TAPE DECK

	as the cassette pops itself in and switches on GLENN MILLER.  

	BACK 	TO PATIO

	Everyone looks around, spooked.

	Suddenly, there is a huge RIPPING sound and FREDDY violently 
	CRASHES up through the concrete!

	ON THE KIDS

	Screaming at the sight of the monster.

	ON THE POOL

	as it begins to churn and boil.

	THE RAZOR-KNIVES

	fan open

	Brave Boy screams as Freddy swipes the knives toward his throat.  
	Before contact, we

										     CUT TO:

	INT. LISA'S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

	as Mr. Poletti scrambles down the stairs with Mrs. poletti close 
	behind.

	EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGTH

	as FREDDY grabs another teen and throws him into the overheated 
	pool.  he SCREAMS as he hits the water.

	INT. LISA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	ON THE DOOR

	as MR. POLETTI bursts through, followed by his wife.

	She screams when she sees

						LISA
					(groggily)
			He couldn't do it, Momma.

	MR. POLETTI looks up at the sound of the OFF-SCREEN SCREAMING.  He 
	rushes across the room to the sliders.

	EXT. POOLSIDE

	Total CHAOS has taken over.  KIDS are running in every direction, 
	screaming as FREDDY lashes out indiscriminately.

	A SCREAMING GIRL is PUSHED INTO THE POOL by the stampeding kids 
	and is SUCKED UNDER.

	TWO BOYS vault the WALL.  One perches on top, holding a hand out 
	to help HIS GIRL over.

						BOY
			Come on!

	FREDDY races at them and SLASHES THE GIRL.  She drops.  The BOY 
	clambers over the wall.

	ON A FLEEING KID

	THE FLEEING KID runs toward camera (no othe rkids in shot).  As he 
	runs, he BEGINS TO SLOW DOWN, as if being held back by an 
	invisible force.  Suddenly, FREDDY APPEARS AND, AT NORMAL SPEED, 
	SLASHES THE KID.

	EXT. CHAIN LINK FENCE - POOLSIDE

	SEVERAL KIDS breaks for the gate.  The PADLOCK is secure.

	ONE KID grabs onto the chain-link fence to climb it.  The links 
	SMOKE AND SIZZLE, and the kid lets go with a scream.

	His HANDS are branded with the pattern of the steel links.

	INT. LISA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Mr. Poletti turns whit, not believing his eyes.  He backs away 
	from the sliders.

						MR. POLETTI
			My God!

	He backs off some more only taking his eyes off the scene to 
	glance at his wife and daughter.

						MR. POLETTI
			Get her out of here!

	MRS. POLETTI looks back at her husband, questioningly.

						MR. POLETTI
					(urgently)
			Get her out of here!

	She starts to help Lisa to her feet.

	MR. POLETTI turns on his heels and runs through the kitchen doors.

	EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

	Freddy stands in the center of the patio, swinging with his claw 
	as a few DO-GOODERS circle him and try to calm him down like he 
	was just some ordinary homicidal maniac.  At Freddy's feet, 
	another hapless VICTIM.

	ONE DO-GOODER who's watched too many police dramas on T.V. jockeys 
	around Freddy and throws out some hostage control lines.

						DO-GOODER
			Now calm down - we want to help you.

	Freddy displays his blades like a rabid cat, ready to strike.

						FREDDY
			Help yourself, fucker.

	Behind them, a row of shrubs suddenly combusts.

	Freddy grabs him by the wrist, laughs and, swinging him around 
	like he were throwing the Hammer, sends him with a bone-splitting 
	CRASH into 

	THE GAS GRILL

	The force of the impact shears the grill from its pedestal and 
	causes a huge column of FIRE to shoot up into the heavens.

	INT. LISA'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT

	MR. POLETTI swings one of the chairs into the gun case SHATTERING 
	the glass door.

	EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

	The KIDS are trapped inside the pool area, frozen with fear, 
	hysterical.

	With the gas-fire raging to one side, he screams out like an 
	evangelist on angel dust.

						FREDDY
			You are all my children!

	SOUND OVER: A SHOT RINGS OUT

	BLOWING AWAY a dish of potato salad on a table at Freddy's side.

	Several teens dive for cover.

	ON MR. POLETTI

	standing in the frame of the shattered sliders.  he is holding a 
	pump-action shotgun.

	as he brings the gun down to give it a second pump.

						MR. POLETTI
			Shit!

	He raises the weapon again, but LISA rushes out and pushes the 
	barrel of the gun down.  MR. POLETTI FIRES into the patio.

						MR. POLETTI
					(furious)
			What are you doing?

	ON FREDDY

	he looks toward the doors and makes eye contact with Lisa.  
	Suddenly, he turns on his hells and walks

	THROUGH THE BRICK WALL as if it weren't there.  The very top of 
	his head and his hat are higher than the top of the wall and 
	remain solid as he moves through and out the other side.  There is 
	SMOKE AND SCORCH on the bricks where he passed.

	SILENCE and stunned faces.  Frightened whimpers here and there.

						MR. POLETTI
			Where did he go?

	ON LISA

	She puts her hand to her mouth - she knows.  MRS. POLETTI has come 
	onto the patio now and joins her daughter and husband.

	Lisa turns and runs into the house.

						MRS. POLETTI
			Where are you going?

	Lisa is already gone.

						MR POLETTI
					(calling her back)
			Lisa!

	JESSE'S CAR - EXT. POLETTI HOUSE - NIGHT

	LISA opens the door and gets into the driver's seat.

	SOUND OVER: POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING

	INT. JESSE'S CAR

	She looks at the make-shift switches and tries to remember how 
	Jesse.

	She flicks the toggle and pushes the starter button.  Nothing.

	She remembers the two wires under the dash and twists them 
	together.  She pushes the starter button.

	The starter GROANS.  It doesn't seem like it's going to start.

	ON LISA

						LISA
					(frantically)
			Please work, please.

	The car back-fires and starts.  She puts it into gear and pulls 
	out.

	EXT. DARK HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	as the old FALCON tears down the highway.

	INT. JESSE'S CAR

	LISA is at the wheel, squinting through the darkness, trying to 
	hold the road.

	EXT. ABANDONED POWERHOUSE - NIGHT

	Lisa pulls up to the building and shuts the engine off.

	INSIDE

	She hastily tears a strip of cloth from her shirt and ties it 
	around the wound on her leg.  She gets out of the car.

	She steps up to the front of the building.

	HER POV

	The entrance is ringed by A PAIR OF MANGY WILD DOGS WITH EERIE, 
	UNNATURAL FACES who growl threateningly as she approaches.

	She shows no fear as she steps right up to the enterance.  THey 
	snap at her hands but she doesn't pull them out of the way.  They 
	part, allowing her to pass through.

	INT. POWERHOUSE - NIGHT

	LISA walks in cautiously.  The powerhouse looks fare different 
	than it did in daylight -- mysterious, dangerous, brewing, almost 
	alive.  Steam is leaking from between rusty rivets and torn 
	gaskets and we hear the POUNDING of ancient expansion tanks 
	belching out rancid air.

	The interior is bathed in an electric blue light that 
	intermittently washes pale as hot white arcs flash in distant 
	corners of the building.

	She walks in deeper, carelessly touching her fingers to a large 
	steam pipe and retracting her hand quickly from its blistering 
	sting.

	She stops at the center of the room.  Suddenly, a twinge of pain 
	on her face and she looks down at ehr leg.

	now, serious pain as she bends over and frenziedly pulls up on the 
	make-shift bandage.

	ON HER WOUND

	It is SWARMING with big, black, carpenter ants.

	She screams and brushes them away with her hands, quaking with 
	disgust.

	As abruptly as they appeared, they are gone; the blood-soaked 
	bandage is intact, covering the wound.

	She bhacks away from teh sump and begins climbing the rusted metal 
	stairway up to the catwalk.

	SOUND OVER:  SCRAPING METAL

	She stops midway and looks around, frightened.

	A few seconds to regain her courage and she steps onto the 
	walkway.

	A RAT

	-- the one she met before -- scurries at her.  It stops, stares at 
	her evilly, hisses unnaturally.

	Lisa screams.

	Suddenly, a CAT pounces on the rat.

	The cat looks up at Lisa with ONLY THE TAIL OF THE RAT STICKING 
	OUT OF ITS MOUTH.  Its eyes are demonic, its teeth crooked yellow 
	fangs.  It growls like a beast five times its size.  The cat takes 
	another chomp on the rat, and the rat's tail disappears down its 
	gullet.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	LISA jumps down off the sairway onto the catwalk and starts to 
	run.  She CLANGS over the steel-mesh flooring.

	A section of the catwalk gives way beneath her feet and 

	LISA plummets as if she were dropped through a trap door.  Her 
	arms flail over her head, but her hand manages to grab around a 
	section of handrail that's still solid.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	we see the catwalk is intact - it looks as if her knees just gave 
	out but she continues to hold on to the railing for dear life.

	She tests the flooring by feeling it before attempting to rise ore 
	release her grip.

	She rises and turns around.

	FREDDY is there.

	Lisa SCREAMS.

						FREDDY
			Had your chance.
					(raising his talons)
			Die now!

	He slashes at her.  She ducks and runs back toward the stairway.

	The STAIRWAY IS RED HOT, SMOKING.

	FREDDY closes in.

						FREDDY
			Come to me, Lisa - I'm waiting for you.

	Lisa stops short, looks around desperately.  There is nowhere to 
	go.

						LISA
			Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there!
			Stop him!

						FREDDY
			Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.

	Freddy strikes, cutting Lisa's shoulder.

						LISA
					(screams)
			Jesse!

	Freddy closes in on her.  She is trapped, finished.

						FREDDY
					(smiles perversely)
			Wanna join your little friend?

						LISA
			Where's Jesse?

						FREDDY
			There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.

						LISA
			I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me.
			Jesse!

	Freddy raises his talons for the kill.  The sharp oints are within 
	an inch of her eyes.  Lisa, terrified, summons up all her energy, 
	all her might, and looks Freddy in the eye.

						LISA
			I love you, Jesse!

	Freddy stares at ehr, talons frozen in mid-air.  The horrible hand 
	quivers, as if against an unseen force.  And then --

	The wounds on Freddy's shoulder and chest rip open.

	He looks down at them, surprised.  They bleed real, human blood.

	LONGER ANGLE

	Lisa breaks past him and starts to run but stops suddenly, a few 
	paces from Freddy.  She turns to look at him leaning weakly 
	against the railing, with an expression of confusion on his face 
	that is almost pathetic.  he touches his wounds, surprised.

	Lisa is no longer afraid - she's angry now.  She looks him 
	straight in the eye.

	His razor-knives click together like they're running low on 
	batteries.

	Freddy beckons her over with the knife on his index finger.

						FREDDY
					(Jesse's voice)	
			Come and get me, Lisa.

	Freddy laughs wickedly.

	LISA moves a step toward Freddy.

						LISA
			I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't
			kill me...He's in there and I want
			him back.  I'm gonna take him away
			from you and you're going straight 
			back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!

						FREDDY
					(getting angry)
			Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!

	Lisa moves closer to Freddy.

						LISA
			Come back to me, Jesse.

	She locks her gaze on Freddy's eyes and looks right through him.

						LISA
			I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.

						FREDDY
			He's dead, you bitch.

	Freddy seems to be in a good deal of pain.  He drops to one knee.  
	Lisa moves closer.  He tries to move away from her.

						FREDDY
					(threateningly)
			I'll kill you now.

						LISA
					(ignoring him)
			He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing
			his grip - you can get out.

						FREDDY
			He'll die with me!

	She kneels beside Freddy, takes off his hat and begins to lovingly 
	stroke his head.  he seems to be writhing a bit and emits several 
	frightened moans.

						FREDDY
			He'll die with both of us!

	She gathers all her nerve and moves in closer.

	He lifts his deadly hand and presses it into her chest.  She 
	flinches in pain but continues to come in close until her mouth is 
	almost touching his.

	he moves his blades onto her back, trying to push them into her 
	flesh, but he is too weak to do much damage.

	TIGHTER ANGLE

	Locked in this strange embrace, she presses her lips against his 
	with as much passion as she can muster and KISSES HIM.

	LONGER ANGLE:  FREDDY & LISA

	There is a moment of quiet.  Then smoke starts to rise off of 
	Freddy.  He pushes her away with an excruciating SCREAM.

	The sound of the POUNDING machinery is becoming deafening.  The 
	electric FLASHES are firing more rapidly and arcing across the 
	Power Plant.  The room is RAPIDLY HEATING UP.

	A SMALL FLAME shoots along the railing.

	SMALL FIRES begin to break out on the catwalk around Freddy.

	ANGLE: PAINTED SURFACE

	The PAINT BEGINS TO SMOKE AND BUBBLE with the heat.  As the heat 
	increases it INTO FLAME.

	ON PIPES 

	STEAM begins shooting up from every pipe joint.

	ANOTHER ANGLE:  PIPES

	STEAM shoots out of the valves.  heavy iron VALVE WHEELS SPIN OFF 
	THEIR STEMS and roll down the FLAMING CATWALKS.

	ON LISA

	Surrounded by flames and smoke, she watches it all with fear and 
	amazement.

	CLOSE ON FREDDY

	His flesh is starting to melt.

	LONGER ANGLE:  FREDDY

	He bursts into DENSE, ALL-ENGULFING FLAME.

	The power plant is going crazy:  the steaming, smoking, and 
	flaming all reach their high peak.  Pipes are bursting with steam:  
	valve wheels flying off.

	Andthen everything begins to slow down, ease off.

	The flames are dying down around the charred corpse, and we can 
	see it is no longer moving.

	The little fires around him are also dying down.

	And the smoke, the steam, and the deafening noise abate.

	ON FREDDY'S CORPSE

	The fires are out now.  there is only some smoke.  And the 
	terrible heat has turned to COOL BLUE LIGHT.

	The still smoldering corpse, with its back to us, begins to stir.

	LONGER ANGLE: CATWALK

	Lisa backs away, terrified.  The corpse turns to her -- it is 
	Jesse, his clothes smoldering, his body singed and blackened with 
	soot.  But alive, coming around as if it were all just a bad 
	dream.

	LISA moves to him and cradles him in her arms.

										    FADE OUT

	FADE IN:

	EXT. WALSH HOUSE - DAY

	A SHINY NEW SCHOOL BUS rolls down the street.  It pulls up by the 
	curb near the Walsh House.

	JESSE, his RIGHT ARM IN A SLING but otherwise fresh and happy, 
	kisses MOM goodbye at the FRONT DOOR.  He hurries down to the bus, 
	gets in.  The DOORS fold shut, the GEARS GRIND and the bus 
	continues along its route.

	INT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY

	There are about a DOZEN KIDS in the bus, playing radios, having a 
	good time, etc.

	LISA, in the back, waves to Jesse and smiles.  She wears a BANDAGE 
	on her shoulder where Freddy slashed her.  Jesse, in the front 
	smiles and waves back.

	Jesse makes his way down the aisle to Lisa, greeting a few kids, 
	slapping a hand or two.

	ON JESSE & LISA

	Jesse plops down next to her, gives her a quick kiss, puts his 
	good arm around her.

						JESSE
			Hi.

						LISA
			Hi.

	Lisa chuckles.

						JESSE
			What's so funny?

						LISA
			We must look like a couple of escapees
			from a veterans' hospital.

	Jesse smiles and shakes his head.

						JESSE
			I can't believe we actually --

	Lisa puts a finger to her mouth to cut him off -- no need to tell 
	about unpleasant things.  Jesse smiles again -- she's right.  he 
	kisses her.

	Jesse moves his head away from hers for the big kiss.  Lisa's eyes 
	are closed, ready to receive it.

	She opens her eyes.  They are pupil-less, blood-streaked, demonic.  
	With an EVIL ROAR, a huge SERPENT TONGUE FLICKS OUT of her mouth 
	and attacks Jesse who screams.

	EXT. DESERT LANDSCAPE - DAY

	The bus WHINES near the top end of third, all of its FLASHERS 
	firing wildly.  It races away through the desert in a cloud of 
	dust.

										    FADE TO:

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Warren Zevon's "I'll Sleep When I'm Dead" BLARES from a radio as 
	we begin a CLOSUP MONTAGE:

	CLOSEUP - A YOUNG GIRL'S HAND

	dips a strip of newspaper into a bowl of paper mache mix.

	CLOSEUP - THE WETTED PAPER

	is applied to a paper mache surface, and a popsicle stick is 
	pressed into place.  (We are TOO TIGHT to see the object being 
	constructed.)

	CLOSEUP - KRISTEN PARKER

	Kristen (16) is strikingly pretty, despite the dark, tired circles 
	under her eyes.  She's exhausted, but desperately trying to stay 
	awake.  She wears pajamas and robe.

	Her head nods, her eyelids close.  She snaps herself awake.

	CLOSEUP - THE RADIO

	She turns the VOLUME UP EVEN LOUDER.

	CLOSEUP - THE CLOCK

	It's 1:20 a.m.

	CLOSEUP - A JAR OF FOLGER'S COFFEE CRYSTALS

	She scoops out a spoonful.

	CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

	She puts the spoonful of coffee crystals in her mouth and chases 
	it down with a swig of Diet Coke.

	CLOSEUP - PAPER MACHE

	Another piece is applied.

	CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

	Nodding off again.  She rouses herself angrily.

	WIDER ANGLE

	The bedroom door opens and her mother enters.  ELAINE PARKER, late 
	30's, is dressed in an expensive evening gown that carefully 
	displays her assets.  She snaps the radio off.

						ELAINE
			Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole
			neighborhood!

						KRISTEN
					(bleary-eyed)
			Hi Mom.

						ELAINE
			Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still
			doing up?  It's past one!

						KRISTEN
			I thought I'd wait for you.

						ELAINE
					(softening)
			Well, I'm home now, so you can go right
			to sleep.  C'mon, angel.

						KRISTEN
			It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.

						ELAINE
					(turning down the bed)
			Kristen, don't start with me.  You know
			what your shrink said...

						KRISTEN
					(sullen)
			He's full of shit.

						ELAINE
			I am not going to let you get me into an
			argument, goddamn it.  Not tonight.  Now
			get in bed.

	Kristen does as she's told.  Her mother goes to the door and 
	reaches for the light switch.

						KRISTEN
					(a soft plea)
			Mom?  I'm still having these awful dreams.

	A MAN'S VOICE comes from downstairs:

						MAN (O.S.)
			Elaine?  Where do you keep the bourbon?

						ELAINE
			I'll be right down!
					(to Kristen)
			Look honey, I've got a guest.

						KRISTEN
			And you don't want to keep him waiting.

						ELAINE
			That's right.  I don't.

	The door closes, shutting Kristen into darkness.  She lies in bed, 
	blinking back angry tears.  She turns on her side, her gaze 
	falling on:

	THE PAPER MACHE OBJECT

	It is a miniature house glowing weirdly in th moonlight.  A crude, 
	homemade replica of the Elm Street House.

	CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

	Staring at the tiny house, hearing her mother's FAINT LAUGHTER 
	downstairs.

	Kristen begins to nod off, though she's fighting it.

	A breeze starts up, rustling her hair.  Leaves fall across her 
	pillow and face.  Her mother's LAUGHTER FADES OUT, replaced by teh 
	EERIE GIGGLING of small children.  She awakes with a start.

	CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS BACK, CRANING UP TO REVEAL:

	Kristen's bed sits in the middle of the dark, deserted street in 
	front of the Elm Street House.

	Small CHILDREN are playing on the lawn.  The boys are dressed in 
	suits, the girls in party dresses.  They are jumping rope and 
	chanting a singsong:

						CHILDREN
			One, two, Freddy's coming for you, 
			three, four, better lock your door,
			five, six, grab your crucifix...

	KRISTEN

	gets out of bed and approaches the children, transfixed.

	...except for one eerily pretty LITTLE GIRL sitting on her red 
	tricycle near the front door, hair billowing in the breezes as she 
	stares at Kristen.

						LITTLE GIRL
			Hello.  What's your name?

						KRISTEN
			Kristen.  What's yours?

	The Little Girl giggles and smiles shyly, but doesn't answer.

						KRISTEN (cont.)
			What is this place?

	The wind kicks up, MOANING.  We hear the SOUND OF WIND CHIMES.

	THE WIND CHIME

	Tinkling in the wind.  The "chimes" are long razors.

	KRISTEN

	reacts.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	The front door of the house CREAKS open behind the Little Girl.  
	Darkness within.

						LITTLE GIRL
					(sadly)
			I have to go now.  Bye.

	RINGING the bell on the handlebar, she pedals her tricycle through 
	the door and is swallowed by the darkness inside.

						KRISTEN
			Wait!  Don't go in there!

	Too late.  Kristen stands alone.  Fighting her fear, she 
	approaches the house.

	INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - NIGHT

	Kristen enters.  The place is barren, empty.  Broken windows, 
	flaking paint, rotted walls.  Leaves skitter across teh floor.

						KRISTEN
			Little girl!

	THE CHILDREN

	They sense her presence and turn their vacant, staring eyes toward 
	her.  They scatter, vanishing into the shadows...

	She hears the JINGLING of the tricycle bell and the GIGGLING of 
	the Little Girl ECHOING FAINTLY from deep inside the house.  Then 
	silence again.  Kristen tries to follow the sounds.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Kristen comes around a corner just in time to see:

	HER POV

	A quick glimpse of the Little Girl vanishing around the corner at 
	the far end of a long, twisted corridor.  The walls are streaked 
	with rust...or perhaps dried blood.

	KRISTEN

	She keeps following.  Being led.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Kristen comes around a corner and finds herself facing a heavy 
	steel door that is just closing wiht a SOLID METALLIC CLANG.  The 
	riveted metal seems out of place in the rotted wood house.

	Kristen goes to the door and pulls it slowly open.  A stairway 
	leading down into darkness.

	STAIRWAY

	Kristen carefully makes her way down the metal steps.

	INT. BOILER ROOM

	Kristen fearfully enters Freddy's decrepit lair.  Ancient rusted 
	boilers stand cold and silent in the shadows.

	The SOFT JINGLE of the tricycle draws Kristen's attention.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	The Little Girl pedals out of the darkness and comes to a stop 
	before Kristen.

						LITTLE GIRL
			This is where he takes us.

	There is a SCREECH OF METAL.  Kristen whirls and sees:

	A BOILER

	The rusted furnace door is swinging open, metal grating on metal.  
	Inside, the charred bones of children lie in heaps of cold ash.  A 
	tricycle lies in the carnage, identical to the Little Girl's -- 
	only charred.

	KRISTEN

	Horrified.  Suddenly, a METAL DOOR SLAMS LOUDLY in the darkness.  
	THUDDING FOOTSTEPS approach, BOOMING CLOSER.

	THE LITTLE GIRL

	looks up at Kristen with sad eyes.

						LITTLE GIRL
					(eerily calm)
			Freddy's home.

	THE BOILER FURNACE

	Now alive with ROARING FLAMES.  The tricycle's paint bubbles and 
	scorches in the intense heat.

	KRISTEN

	scoops the Little Girl into her arms and runs in blind terror.  
	She glances back over her shoulder to see:

	FREDDY

	looming from the row of boilers, an indistinct silhouette in the 
	hellish smoke and flames.  His maniacal LAUGHTER ECHOES through 
	the chamber.

	KRISTEN

	ducks through a doorway into another room, still carrying the 
	Little Girl.

	INT. ROOM

	A hundred teenage bodies hang from teh ceiling, strung up in the 
	darkness like butchered meat.

	KRISTEN

	gazes in horror.  She looks down at the Little Girl cradled in her 
	arms -- she is now a horribly charred, brittle corpse.  Suddenly, 
	her tiny mouth bursts open, emitting a ghastly, ear-splitting 
	SCREAM!

									     SHOCK CUT TO:

	CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

	As she sits bolt upright in bed, panting in terror, face bathed in 
	sweat.  She looks around, recognizing her own room.

	She gets out of bed and walks unsteadily to the bathroom.

	INT - BATHROOM

	She clicks on the light and looks at her reflection in the mirror.  
	Still trembling, she runs water in the sink and splashes her face, 
	trying to calm down.

	The water becomes too hot.  Steam rises.

	She tries to turn the water off, but the pressure increases.  More 
	Steam.

	CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

	She fiddles with the handle, confused.

	As she turns it, the four-pronged handle suddenly springs to life, 
	grasping her hand.

	KRISTEN

	gasps and looks up.  Freddy's face grins out at her from the 
	mirror.  She SCREAMS.  Steam billows up.

	THE SINK

	The other faucet handle begins to flex and stretch, turning into 
	Freddy's claw hand.  Finger razors grow.

	KRISTEN

	SCREAMING, struggling to break free.

	FREDDY

	leering from the mirror, laughing.  The claw hand rises up into 
	frame, poising to slash Kristen's exposed wrist.

	CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

	SCREAMING as the blades slash downward.

	CLOSEUP - FREDDY

	Grinning as a spray of blood hits the mirror.

	THE BATHROOM DOOR

	bursts open, revealing Kristen's mother.  She SCREAMS.

	REVERSE ANGLE - THE BATHROOM

	No steam.  The mirror and sink are normal...except for the thin 
	streaks of spattered blood.

	Kristen turns to her mother, slowly waking from her dream.  She 
	holds a bloody razor in her hand.  Her wrist is slashed.

						KRISTEN
					(dazed, weak)
			Mommy...?

	She collapses.

										     CUT TO:

	EXT. WESTIN HILLS PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

	Isolated and somewhat gothic, it's an enormous multi-winged 
	structure built by the Catholic Church in the 1920's.  A belltower 
	is centerpiece to several rambling wings.  Originally an insane 
	asylum, it is now a modernized state-run facility.  An iron fence 
	surrounds the sprawling grounds.

	INT. HOSPITAL - ADOLESCENT WING - DAY

	DOLLYING with MAX, the burly black Chief Orderly, as he makes his 
	morning rounds.  He wheels a rolling cart containing a variety of 
	medications down the hall.  A NEWSCASTER'S VOICE comes from the 
	small portable radio dangling from the cart:

						NEWSCASTER
			In local nows, two more teenage deaths
			have occurred -- both suicides.  County
			health officials are at a loss to explain
			this alarming trend --

	Grimacing, Max switches to a music station as DOCTOR NEIL GOLDMAN 
	(early 30's), bright and intense, falls in step.

						NEIL
					(absorbed in a clipboard
					 of patient's charts)
			Nothing like a little cheery news to start 
			the day.

						MAX
			Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about
			all these suicides.

						NEIL
			Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all
			the help we can get.

						MAX
			Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about
			it.  Their parents all dropped acid in 
			the Sixties.

						NEIL
			It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks
			it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock
			& roll.

						MAX
			Shit, that's what keeps people alive.

	Max exits frame.  Neil continues on.  JENNIFER,  a girl of 14, 
	approaches.

						NEIL
			Good morning, Jennifer.

						JENNIFER
			Morning, Doctor Goldman.

						NEIL
			How's your hand?

	She extends her hand for inspection -- it is scarred with 
	cigarette burns.  She points to three different welts.

						JENNIFER
			Menthol, regular, ultra-light.

						NEIL
			They're healing up nicely.

						JENNIFER
			I've been good.  When do I get cigarette
			priveleges back?

						NEIL
			Don't hold your breath.

	Jennifer shrugs.  It was worth a try.  She moves on.

	TARYN, a 17 year old blonde, approaches.  She appears exhausted, 
	dark tired circles under her eyes.

						NEIL
			Hi Taryn.  You don't look so hot, kid.
			Been getting any sleep?

	She ignores him.  Neil watches her float past, then jots a note on 
	his clipboard.

						NEIL (cont.)
			Didn't think so.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Neil comes to the Quiet Room and peers through the small mesh-grid 
	window.

	NEIL'S POV - (QUIET ROOM)

	KINCAID, an enormous and powerful-looking 17 year old with a 
	shaved head is huddled in the corner of the white padded room, 
	gazing at nothing.

	NEIL - (HALLWAY)

	makes a notation on his clipboard.  DOCTOR ELIZABETH SIMMS, the 
	hospital superior, appears at his elbow.

						SIMMS
			How is he?

						NEIL
			Cooling down.

						SIMMS
			If he continues having these outbursts,
			I'll have to have him isolated permanently.

						NEIL
			Don't worry, it won't come to that.

	They exit frome.  CAMERA PUSHES UP to teh mesh-grid window of the 
	Quiet Room for a shot of Kincaid.

	CLOSEUP - KINCAID - (QUIET ROOM)

	He stares into space, singing softly under his breath.

						KINCAID
			I ain't gonna dream no more, no more,
			I ain't gonna dream no more.  All night
			long I sing this song, 'cause I ain't 
			gonna dream no more...

	DOLLYING WITH NEIL AND SIMMS - (HALLWAY)

						NEIL
			I read the report on our new staff 
			member.

						SIMMS
			What did you think?

						NEIL
			Frankly, I don't understand why some
			grad school superstar is being treated
			like a seasoned pro.

						SIMMS
			She's been doing ground-breaking
			research on pattern nightmares.

						NEIL
			Elizabeth, we don't need any outside
			help.  I know these kids.  I don't 
			want some hot-shot taking chances 
			with them just so she can get published.

	Simms is about to say more, but is interrupted by:

						P.A. VOICE
			Doctor Goldman to Examination, stat.

	They hurry down the hall.

	NURSES' STATION

	Kristen's mother, near hysteria, is loudly berating a NURSE.

						ELAINE
			Don't give me that shit!  She's just 
			trying to get attention, that's all!
			I'm not playing her little game any-
			more!

	Neil and Simms rush past into the examination room.

	INT. EXAMINATION ROOM

	Neil and Simms burst into a chaotic struggle.  Kristen is going 
	berserk, fighting the STAFF as they try to restrain her and 
	wrestle her onto a gurney -- the gurney goes crashing into the 
	wall.  A frantic NURSE addresses Neil:

						NURSE
			Suicide attempt.  They just brought her
			in from County General!

						NEIL
			What's her name?

						NURSE
			Kristen Parker.  She was fine until we
			tried to sedate her.

	Her face contorted with terror, Kristen kicks and bites and 
	scratches as ORDERLIES try to pin her.

						ORDERLY
			Watch it!  She tore her stiches out!

						NEIL
			Kristen, we want to help you!

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Max enters and takes immediate control.  he shoves everybody out 
	of the way, spins Kristen effortlessly around, and pins her arms 
	firmly from behind.  She tries to struggle, but he's too strong.  
	She weakens.

						MAX
					(compassionate)
			Calm down, baby sister, that's enough
			nonsense for now.

	Neil takes a hypo from the nurse and approaches Kristen slowly.

						NEIL
			Kristen, I'm Doctor Goldman.  I'm not
			going to hurt you.  I'm just going to
			give you something to help you sleep.

	KRISTEN goes berserk again and kicks Neil in the stomach.  Max is 
	thrown off balance and crashes into a rolling cart -- medical 
	instruments shower to the floor.

	Kristen grabs a pair of wicked-looking surgical scissors.  She 
	slashes at max's hand, drawing blood.

						NEIL
			Back off, Max!

	Kristen huddles into a corner, ready to skewer anybody who gets 
	close.  A tense stand-off.

						NEIL (cont.)
			Kristen, put the scissors down!  No-
			body's gonna hurt you!

	But the girl makes no move to drop her guard.  She starts rocking 
	back and forth, coming apart at the seams, moaning a little song:

						KRISTEN
			Five, six, grab your crucifix...
			seven, eight, better stay up late...
			nine, ten, never...never...

	She can't seem to find the words in her confused mind.

						NANCY (O.S.)
			Never sleep again.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	Instant silence in the room.  All eyes go to NANCY THOMPSON 
	standing in the doorway.  She's a young woman now, possessing 
	beauty and great inner strength.  her hair still bears the white 
	streak.  She speaks as if coming out of a trance:

						NANCY
			Who taught you that rhyme?

	KRISTEN

	Her eyes are locked with Nancy's.

	NANCY

	The staff members part before her as she walks to Kristen.  She 
	takes the scissors from Kristen's hand.  Kristen falls into 
	Nancy's arms, sobbing.

	NEIL

	stares at Nancy in amazement.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - DAY

	Neil and Nancy are finishing a late lunch in teh nearly deserted 
	cafeteria.

						NANCY
			Tell me about the kids.

						NEIL
			You'll get to meet them all tomorrow.
			They're...survivors.  In a way.  All
			severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia,
			narcolepsy, bedwetting...

						NANCY
			But nightmares are the common thread?

						NEIL
			Right.  They seem to share a group
			delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of
			a better word.  They're so traumatized,
			they'll do anything not to sleep.

						NANCY
			Anything?

						NEIL
					(playing with his coffee)
			We lost a kid about a month ago to
			Fairview.  I don't know where he got
			the razor...but he cut off his own
			eyelids to stay awake.

						NANCY
			Oh God.

						NEIL
			Ever work with vets?
					(Nancy shakes her head)
			These kids act like they've got
			D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome.
			If I didn't know better, I'd swear 
			they'd seen heavy combat.

						NANCY
			I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.

						NEIL
			What's that supposed to mean?

	She shrugs, not answering.  Neil lets it pass.

						NEIL (cont.)
					(changing the subject)
			By the way, that was great work with
			the new patient.  Pretty smooth for an
			intern.

						NANCY
			I've had some experience with pattern
			nightmares.

						NEIL
			So I've been told.  Practically an 
			obsession of your.

						NANCY
			Call it a passion.
					(glances at her watch)
			I've got to get going.

						NEIL
			Make sure to check in with Max, he'll
			give you the 25 cent tour.

	She gathers her things.  Her purse falls over, scattering its 
	contents.  A bottle of pills rolls out.  Neil helps gather the 
	items -- he picks up the pills.

	INSERT - PILL BOTTLE

	The label reads: HYPNOCYL 60 mg.  1-2 TABS FOR SLEEP.

	BACK TO SCENE

	She takes the pills and stuffs them in her purse along with 
	everything else.

						NANCY
			Thanks.  See you in the morning.

	She is almost out the door when Neil calls to her.

						NEIL
			Ms. Thompson.

						NANCY
			Call me Nancy.

						NEIL
			Only if you call me Neil.  What was that
			nursery rhyme all about?

						NANCY
			Just something children sing...to keep
			the boogeyman away.

	She exits.  Neil stares after her thoughtfully.

	HIS POV - LONG LENS OF THE CROWDED HALLWAY

	As Nancy turns and vanishes from sight, a NUN is a white habbit is 
	revealed at the far end of the hallway -- she seems to be staring 
	at him.  PEOPLE are wiping frame as they criss-cross the hallway, 
	affording mere glimpses of her.

	NEIL

	A bit slf-conscious.  Is the woman really staring at him?

	HIS POV - LONG LENS

	People keep wiping frame as they bustle in the hallway.  The nun 
	is now gone.

	NEIL

	frowns, puzzled.  he dismisses it and downs his last sip of 
	coffee.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

	Max is giving Nancy a tour.

						MAX
			The whole wing's devoted ot this 
			program.  That's your office.

						NANCY
			A little basic, but nice.

						MAX
			I'll have a file cabinet in there before
			tomorrow.
					(leading her down a hall)
			The patient's rooms are down here.

	Nancy pauses at an open door, looking into:

	INT. PHILLIP'S ROOM

	PHILLIP, 16, sits at a work table fashioning the face of a 
	homemade marionette out of clay.  Other marionettes hang from the 
	wall. A comical dog, a white knight, a clown, etc.

						MAX
					(from doorway)
			This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker.

						NANCY
			Why is that?

						PHILLIP
			'Cause I sleepwalk.  A perfectly normal
			event that our illustrious staff loves
			to theorize about endlessly.

						MAX
			Phillip, this is Nancy.

						PHILLIP
			Hi.  Welcome to the Snake Pit.

						NANCY
			Thanks.
					(admiring marionettes)
			Nice work.

						PHILLIP
			They really oughtta be carved out of 
			wood, but they won't let me have a
			knife.  I might, you know...
					(mimes slashing his wrist)
			Fffft!

						MAX
			That lump over there is Kincaid.

	Kincaid is lying on a bed, reading a comic book.

						MAX (cont.)
			Take a close look.  He gets his ass
			thrown in the Quiet Room so often, 
			you probably won't see much of him.
			Right, Cool Breeze?

						KINCAID
			I do it so I don't have to look at your
			face all the time.

						MAX
					(grins)
			Riiiigghht.

	Max and Nancy move on.

	INT. HALLWAY

	DOLLYING WITH Max and Nancy.

						MAX
			They're good kids.  But don't let 'em
			fool you.  They're dangerous...to 
			themselves and each other.

	They exit frame.  PAN TO JOEY, a wan 16 year old watching them 
	from around the corner.  He has a tear drop drawn in ink under one 
	eye.

	A SOFT RYTHMIC SQUEAKING draws his attention.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	MARCIE, a cute 19 year old candy-striper, is wheeling a cart to a 
	laundry closet.

	As she begins to load the cart with clean towels, several fall to 
	the floor.  Joey hurries over.

	CLOSER ANGLE

	Joey picks up the towels and holds them out to Marcie.  She gives 
	him a bright smile.

						MARCIE
			Why thank you, Joey.

	Joey grins mutely, obviously smitten.  LORENZO, a cocky, handsome 
	young orderly appears.

						LORENZO
			Hey, Marcie.  These going to C Ward?

						MARCIE
			Yeah.

						LORENZO
			C'mon, I'll walk you down.

	They start down the hall, the cart still SQUEAKING RYTHMICALLY.  
	Marcie turns back, giving Joey a smile and a wave.

						MARCIE
			See you later.

	JOEY

	smiles weakly as he watches them go.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. KRISTEN'S HOUSE - DAY

	Nancy guides Kristen's mother through signing a sheaf of hospital 
	forms.  Elaine is carefully and expensively dressed in fashionable 
	tennis clothes.

						NANCY
			Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different?
			Did you notice anything strange before 
			she made the attempt?

						ELAINE
			Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've
			spent thousands on psychiatirists.

						NANCY
			Did she always have nightmares?

						ELAINE
			They've gotten worse since I took away
			her credit cards.

						NANCY
			I'm serious.

						ELAINE
			Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what
			you want from me.

						NANCY
			Just some answers.  There are other kids
			involved, its not just Kristen.  All 
			good kids, smark kids.

						ELAINE
			I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the
			experts on this, not me.  If I had any
			insights, believe me, I'd share them
			with you.

						NANCY
			I'm sure you would.

						ELAINE
					(rising)
			Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get
			to the club.

						NANCY
			I'll need to take her things.

						ELAINE
			The maid packed a suitcase.
					(calling out)
			Teresa!  Teresa?

						NANCY
			I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.

						ELAINE
			First door up the stairs.

	INT. KRISTEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Nancy enters and finds the suitcase on the bed.  As she turns to 
	leave, her eye is caught by:

	THE PAPER MACHE ELM STREET HOUSE

	sitting on Kristen's drafting table.

	NANCY

	Amazed.  Shaken.  She reaches out slowly, almost afraid to touch 
	it.  She picks it up.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. NEIL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Neil sits at a computer terminal in his study.  He hooks the modem 
	to his phone and accesses a mainframe.  The screen comes to life, 
	blinking.  He punches in a command.

	THE SCREEN

	A readout appears, ticking down an endless list of drug 
	categories.

	NEIL

	Working the keyboard, searching for something.  Finally:

	THE SCREEN

	The glowing green letters read:

			HYPNOCYL
			FDA classification:  Experimental.
			Effective for management of
			psychotic disorders.  For sedation
			where dreamless sleep is considered
			optimal; suppression of night terror.

	NEIL

	He shuts down the computer and eases back in his chair.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. NANCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Nancy sits in a thin, high-tech reading chair, engrossed in 
	Kristen's medical file.  The paper mache Elm Street House sits on 
	a table nearby.

	CLOSEUP - NANCY

	Shee is starting to nod off as she reads.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - KRISTEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Kristen lies in bed, sketching on a newsprint pad with charcoal.  
	A rendering of the Elm Street House.

	She begins to nod out.  her eyes flutter closed.  CAMERA DOLLIES 
	IN TIGHT on her face.  We hear the DISTANT, GHOSTLY JINGLING of a 
	tricycle bell.  Her eyes slowly open.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Kristen watches, terrified, as a tricycle rolls into the room by 
	itself, leaving bloody tire tracks.  The same tricycle that 
	belonged to the Little Girl.

	THE TRICYCLE

	comes to a stop...then begins to glow red-hot and melt, warping 
	and sagging as if from an astonishing inner heat.

	KRISTEN

	gets out of bed, edges past the ghastly melting apparition, and 
	backs out of the room.

	CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

	As she backs out the door, we see it is the red Elm Street door.  
	She pauses, realizing something is terribly wrong -- suddenly the 
	door SLAMS SHUT INTO CAMERA.

	CAMERA ZOOMS OUT IN A DIZZYING RUSH to reveal the Elm Street 
	House.  Kristen is now trapped inside.

	INT. ELM STREET HOUSE

	Kristen tries to get out, but the door is locked.  She turns, 
	looking for another means of escape.  We hear a FAINT BUZZING.

	INT. DINING ROOM

	Kristen enters.  The BUZZING IS LOUDER.

	HER POV - THE DINNER TABLE

	The table is set for a formal dinner.  The grotesque, rotted 
	remains of a roast pig sits on a platter, covered with flies.

	KRISTEN

	is revolted.

	THE PIG

	leaps up, SQUEALING.

	WIDER ANGLE

	Kristen is suddenly pulled down, vanishing beneath the surface of 
	the liquid floor.  The furnishings remain, hanging in their own 
	gravity.

	UNDERWATER

	Kristen thrashes wildly in the the pitch-black water.  She swims 
	frantically, lungs bursting for air.  Impossible to tell which way 
	is up.

	HER POV

	A door hanging in watery limbo a short distance ahead.

	KRISTEN

	swims for it.

	THE DOOR

	She clutches the ornate handle and strains to open the door.

	INT. ROOM (OTHER SIDE OF TEH DOOR)

	The door swings open.  Kristen emerges from a solid wall of water 
	and steps into the room.  She is magically dry.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	It is the Elm Street living room, foreboding and nearly barren of 
	furniture.

	A large lump forms under the rug at the far end of the room and 
	undulates toward her sinuously.  A long tubular shape.

	Kristen backs away.

	The shape circles her aimlessly, then slithers up the wall -- a 
	huge, writhing entity traveling within the wall surface.

	The shape arcs back down toward the carpet and disappears below 
	the floorline.

	Kristen turns about apprehensively, searching for the mysterious 
	entity.  Beat.

	Suddenly, the creatures erupts through the floor directly beneath 
	her in a shower of wood splinters, engulfing her legs as it 
	rockets straight up.  It slams back down like a whale surfacing, 
	Kristen locked firmly in its jaws.

	THE CREATURE

	is a gigantic serpent/worm version of Freddy, ribbed and organic, 
	encrusted with mucous and slime.  Its slavering jaws dislocate 
	like a snake's, the skin stretching grotesquely as it begins to 
	swallow Kristen from the legs up.

	E.C.U. Nancy dozing.  Her eyes flutter open as she hears a FAINT 
	REVERBERATION of Kristen's call.

	LOW ANGLE

	Nancy strains to listen -- all is silent now.  uneasy, she rises 
	from her chair...but freezes in place as she hears the UNEARTHLY 
	CALL again, brely discernable.  She turns.

	THE ELM STREET HOUSE MODEL

	The sound seems to emanate from the strange paper mache dollhouse.  
	CAMERA RUSHES IN TIGHT as its tiny front door swings slowly open.

	NANCY

	DOLLYING IN TIGHT ON HER FACE as she puts a hand to her head, a 
	feeling of dizziness suddenly washing over her.

	WIDER

	She sinks back into her chair -- and keeps right on going, 
	impossibly sucked away into the thin chair.  She is gone in the 
	blink of an eye.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. ELM STREET LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	A large ornate oval mirror hangs on the wall.  The glass EXPLODES 
	as Nancy bursts into the room.

	She rises, staring in horror and disbelief.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	The horrid Freddy/snake expands and contracts around Kristen, 
	slowly wolfing her down, its awful diseased maw inching up past 
	her waist.

						KRISTEN
			NANCY!

	NANCY

	snaps into action.  She scoops up a long jagged shard of broken 
	mirror, cutting her palm in the process.

	She leaps into the fray, jamming the shard of glass into 
	Freddy/snake's eye -- the eye bursts, spraying rancid ichor.

	FREDDY/SNAKE

	Regurgitating Kristen, the creature arcs back, ready to strike.  
	his good eye locks on Nancy, recognizing his old enemy.

						FREDDY/SNAKE
					(total rage)
			YOU!

	CLOSEUP - FREDDY/SNAKE

	ROARS as the snake face peels back like old parchment and 
	instantly transforms into a mind blowing skull/snake/Freddy with 
	horns and double rows of razor teeth -- striking INTO CAMERA.

	NANCY

	grabs Kristen and barrel-rolls out of the way.  They scramble out 
	the door.

	INT. HALLWAY (OTHER SIDE OF DOOR)

	Nancy slams the door and fumbles with the lock, snapping it into 
	place.

						NANCY
			You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?

						KRISTEN
			I -- I think so!

	The razor-teeth burst through the door, splintering it.

						NANCY
			Then get us back out!

	Kristen tries to concentrate -- the teeth tear a chunk from the 
	door and the Freddy/beast's drooling snout lunges through.  
	Chewing.  Tearing.

						NANCY (cont.)
			NOW, KRISTEN!  DO IT NOW!

	coffee across them room.  She is shaking in the aftermath of 
	terror, her fists clenched tight, not knowing if she just dreamed 
	it all or not.

	Suddenly realizing, she unclenches her hand -- the palm is cut 
	from the shard of broken mirror she plunged into Freddy/snake's 
	eye.

	Nancy bursts in with the Elm Street House model under her arm and

			Didn't get much sleep.

						NEIL
			Well, we've got --

	But she's already turned the corner and gone.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Nancy rushes up to Kristen's room and looks in.  Empty.  Max 
	appears, coming up the hall.

						NANCY
			Max, where's Kristen?

						MAX
			She's been waiting outside your office
			since breakfast.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - (NANCY'S OFFICE HALL)

	Nancy rushes around the corner and stops.  Kristen is sitting 
	patiently in the hallway outside Nancy's office.  She stands.

						NANCY
					(holds up Elm Street model)
			I used to live in this house.

						KRISTEN
			But...it's just a house I've dreamed

	Nancy and Kristen speak in low tones with the door closed.

						NANCY
			Have you ever done that before?  Pulled

						KRISTEN
					(dreamy, far-away look)
			When I was a little girl.  Three or four.
			If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in.
			The dream would always get better.
					(smiles)
			He always used to tell me about it the 
			next day -- he used to think they were
			his dreams.
						NANCY
			When did it stop?

						KRISTEN
			When I was still a kid.  My folks got
			divorced.
					(beat)
			After a while, I thought I'd imagined
			the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.

						NANCY
			It's an amazing gift.

	Pause.  Then, softly:

			That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't

			He's real.

	just out of heavy combat.  Nancy takes of a blitzed-out squad just

						NEIL
			Okay, Group's in session.  Straight

						SIMMS
			Today I'd like to start by getting us

	The kids murmur a chorus of AD-LIBBED GREETINGS.

						WILL
			I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a
			little accident, as you can see.

						TARYN
			Accident my ass.  I thought this was
			supposed to be straight talk in here.

						KINCAID
			Hey, so he took a jump.  At least he
			wasn't sticking needles in his arms
			with a bunch of lowlifes.

						SIMMS
			Save it, Kincaid.  Jennifer?

						JENNIFER
			I'm Jennifer Caulfield.  When I get
			out of here I'm going to L.A. to be 
			an actress.  i'm gonna be on T.V.

						KINCAID
			Yeah.  Lifestyles of the Rich and
			Psychotic.

						JENNIFER
			Screw you.

			This is Joey.  He used to be a debater

	Joey grins at Nancy shyly, nodding his head in greeting.

						TARYN
			I'm Taryn White.  I only came here
			because it was a better deal than

					(pause)
			Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through

						NANCY
			Your dreams?

						TARYN
					(softly)
			Hey, everybody has bad dreams.

						PHILLIP
			Can I interject something here?  Just
			to save us all some time?

						NEIL
			Go ahead, Phillip.

						PHILLIP
					(to Nancy)
			According to our kind hosts, our dreams
			are a group psychosis.  Sort of a mellow
			mass hysteria.  The fact that we all 
			dreamt about this guy before we ever
			met doesn't seem to impress anybody.

	The kids murmur in agreement.

						PHILLIP (cont.)
			So we go in circles making minimal
			progress with maximum effort.

						SIMMS
			And you won't make any progress until
			you can recognize your dreams for what
			they are.

						NANCY
			And what are they?

						SIMMS
			The by-product of guilt.  Psychological
			scars steaming from moral conflicts and
			overt sexuality.

						KINCAID
			Great.  Now it's my dick that's killing
			me.

						KRISTEN
			Tell them, Nancy.  Tell them what's 
			really going on.

						NEIL
					(surprised)
			Yes, tell us, Nancy.

						NANCY
			All I can say is this isn't something
			that's just going to disappear.  you're
			all going to have to face it.  Fight it.
			And if you're willing to work together...
			wiling to stand up to your deepest
			fears...I think we can beat it.

	PANNING THE KIDS

	Their expressions reflect a quiet mix of hope and fear.  They are

	BOOM UP TO the marionettes hanging on the wall.  An eerie

	Max and another ORDERLY enter.  Kincaid starts to freak.  he kicks 
	a chair at them, screaming!

						KINCAID
			NOBODY'S GONNA PUT ME TO SLEEP!

	The orderlies get Kincaid into an armlock and wrestle him, 
	fighting and kicking, out the door.

	Simms follows the struggle out into the hallway.  Neil and Nancy 
	join her.

	INT. HALLWAY

	Simms, flushed and livid, watches Kincaid get dragged away.  She 
	turns to Neil.

						SIMMS
			We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting
			with him.

						NANCY
			You can't!  They'll be defenseless against
			their dreams.

						SIMMS
			That's precisely what they need.  Some
			uninterrupted REM sleep to release all
			this negative energy.

						NANCY
					(to Neil, desperate)
			Neil, please --

	Neil pauses, wavering between nancy and Simms.  He finally comes 
	to a decision:

						NEIL
			Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.
					(she gives him a 
					 blank stare)
			It's a dream suppressant.

						SIMMS
			I know what it is.  I just can't believe
			what I'm hearing.
					(indicates Nancy)
			What has she talked you into?

						NEIL
			Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's 
			my decision.  I want the dreams stopped
			until we get some answers.

						SIMMS
			I won't allow it.

						NEIL
			I'll go straight to Carver if I have
			to.  He'll either back me up or accept
			my resignation.

	Simms pauses, then:

						SIMMS
			If soemthing goes wrong, I'll make sure
			you're held responsible.  Fully responsible.

	Simms exits.  Neil watches her go.

						NEIL
			I can't believe I just did that.

						NANCY
			Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in
			by tomorrow?

						NEIL
			We're gonna try.

	He turns and walks away -- but pauses, looking back.

						NEIL
			I hope you know what you're getting us
			into.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

	DOLLYING with Max as he works his way down the hall, spot-checking 
	the dorm area.  Nancy appears.

						MAX
			Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If
			you're trying for O.T., you're in the 
			wrong place.

						NANCY
			I just wanted to be here for the kids.
			how are they?

						MAX
			Restless.  Very restless.

	Kristen appears at her door, looking sleepy and exhausted.

						KRISTEN
			Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?

						NANCY
			Sure.

						MAX
					(to Nancy)
			You need me, I'll be here all night.

						NANCY
			Thanks, Max.

	She goes to join Kristen in her room.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Taryn, wearing robe and slippers, emerges from the women's 
	bathroom and shuffles back toward her room.

	Lorenzo, the young orderly, appears in her path, twirling a 
	keyring.

						LORENZO
			Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.

						TARYN
					(disinterested, tries
					 to get past him)
			Can't be good news coming from you.

						LORENZO
			Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.

						TARYN
			So?

						LORENZO
					(twirling keys)
			So...got the keys to heaven, baby.

						TARYN
			What?

						LORENZO
			The dispensary.  I'm talking clean
			pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club
			meth.

						TARYN
					(steps past him)
			I don't do that shit.

	He grabs her wrist, exposing her arm -- her skin is scarred with 
	old needle tracks.

						LORENZO
			What are these, beauty marks?

						TARYN
					(yanks her arm away)
			Those are ancient history.

						LORENZO
			Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the
			mood for a history lesson, I'm your 
			teacher, understand?

						TARYN
			Stay out of my face or I'll go straight
			to Max.

						LORENZO
			Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy
			junkie chick like you?

						TARYN
			Fuck off.

	She heads off to her room.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. TV ROOM - NIGHT

	A rather drab, institutional room with second-hand couches an 
	chairs.  jennifer sits in a worn armchair watching the TV -- a 
	massive old metal RCA.  She is fighting sleep, but starting to nod 
	off.  Max enters.

						MAX
			Girl, what are you doing?

						JENNIFER
			Watching TV.

						MAX
			I can see that. You watch too damn much
			TV.

						JENNIFER
			Research.

						MAX
			Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.

						JENNIFER
			Wait and see.

						MAX
			If Simms catches you in here after lights
			out, she'll chew my ass ragged.

						JENNIFER
					(pleading)
			I gotta stay up, Max.

						MAX
			Jennifer --

						JENNIFER
			Just tonight, please?  I can't handle
			the nightmare.  Not tonight.  Not
			after Phillip.

	Max hesitates...then relents against his better judgement.

						MAX
			If you get caught, I never saw you.
			Deal?

						JENNIFER
					(relieved)
			Deal.  Thanks.

	Max exits, shaking his head.  Jennifer turns back to the TV -- the 
	Late Show drones on.  She shakes herself, still fighting to stay 
	awake.

	She digs a hidden pack of cigarettes from under the chair cushion 
	and lights up.  She takes a deep drag -- then, wincing with pain, 
	burns her hand with the lit cigarette.  Anything to stay awake.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. KRISTEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Kristen lies in bed.  Nancy sits nearby in a chair -- it seems she 
	may keep an all-night vigil.

	She notices an array of gymnastics posters taped to the wall.

						NANCY
			You like gymnastics?

						KRISTEN
					(nods)
			I was on the team at school.
					(beat)
			I was never very good, though.

						NANCY
			We're not always as good at things as
			we'd like.

						KRISTEN
			Yeah, but I was really not good.

	They laugh softly.

						KRISTEN
			Yeah, but I was really not good.

	They laugh softly.

						KRISTEN (cont.)
			I'm glad you're here.

	Nancy pauses, wrestling with a decision.  She digs into her purse, 
	pulls out her bottle of Hypnocyl, and shakes the contents into her 
	hand.  Just two pills left.  She gives them to Kristen.

						KRISTEN (cont.)
			What are they?

						NANCY
					(softly)
			They'll keep the dreams away.  For
			tonight.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. TV ROOM - NIGHT

	Jennifer is still fighting to stay awake as she watches TV.  She 
	switches around with the channel changer, stopping on a Dick 
	Cavett interview.  His guest is Sally Kellerman.

	JENNIFER

	nodding out again.

	TV SET

						DICK CAVETT
			Well, that is the great American dream,
			isn't it?  To come to L.A. and be a TV
			star?

						SALLY KELLERMAN
			Well, I suppose it --

	The image sputters with snowy interference.

	JENNIFER

	Her eyes fluttering.

	TV SET

	Alternating between snow and image.

						KELLERMAN
			-- find a good teacher.  An actor has 
			to study, to learn.  I think that's
			crucial.

						FREDDY/CAVETT
					(gleefully)
			WHO GIVES A FUCK WHAT YOU THINK?

	JENNIFER

	Her eyes snap open, her body stiffening.  She stares at:

	TEH TV SCREEN

	Nothing now but static.

	JENNIFER

	Frowning.  Must have imagined it.  She rises and smacks the side 
	of the set, trying to get the picture back.  Nothing.

	Suddenly, two arms rip from each side of the TV set and grab her 
	by the shoulders.  The arms are a horrid hybrid of Freddy's arms 
	and RCA tubes and wiring.  She SCREAMS as she is lifted off the 
	ground.

	TV SET

	Freddy's head grows and stretches out of the top of the set, 
	wearing the rabbit-ear antenna like some horrible insect.  
	Jennifer keeps SCREAMING.

						FREDDY
			This is it, Jennifer!  Your big break
			in TV!

	he rams her head into the screen with hideously brutal force -- 
	there is an EXPLOSION of glass and electrical sparks.

										     CUT TO:

	EXT. CEMETARY - DAY

	A midwestern cemetary on a rolling hillside.  A gentle drizzle 
	falls on a crowd of mourners clustered at twin gravesites.  A 
	PRIEST intones the eulogy.  Among the mourners are Dr. Simms, Max, 
	Nancy...but Neil is missing.

	CLOSER - MAX AND NANCY

	Staring as the caskets are lowered.

	MASTER - THE FUNERAL

	CAMERA BOOMS BACK to reveal Neil standing on a rise overlooking 
	the funeral.  he's under the shelter of a large oak tree, but is 
	still soaked by the drizzle.  He stares down, grief-stricken, his 
	tears masked by rain.

						NUN (O.S.)
			Don't be ashamed, young man.  This is
			a place for sorrow.

	ANTOHER ANGLE

	The nun in white stands clsoe by (Neil saw her in the hospital 
	hallway).  She appears in her 60's, but carries herself with a 
	strength that belies her years.  Neil wipes his eyes.

						NUN (cont.)
			What faith do you follow?

	He chokes back a bitter laugh.

						NEIL
			Science...I suppose.

						NUN
			A sad choice.

						NEIL
			There are times when it doesn't offer
			much comfort.
					(pause)
			I've seen you before.  Sister...?

						NUN
			Mary Helena.

						NEIL
			You do volunteer work at the hospital?

						NUN
			I come from time to time.  When I'm
			needed.

	Neil turns his gaze back toward the funeral, lost in his own 
	private grief.

						NEIL
					(softly)
			I could've saved them.

						NUN
			Only one thing can save the children.
			The unquiet spirit must be laid to 
			rest.  It is an abomination to God and
			Man.

						NEIL
					(blankly)
			I beg your pardon?

						NANCY
					(calling O.S.)
			Neil?

	Neil turns and moves to the edge of the rise as Nancy crests the 
	hill.  The services have ended, the crowd is dispersing.

						NANCY (cont.)
			What are you doing up here?

						NEIL
			I was just talking to --

	He turns, but the nun is gone.

						NANCY
			To who?

						NEIL
					(shrugs)
			Doesn't matter.

						NANCY
			C'mon.  Let's get out of this rain.

	As they head slowly down the hill, PAN TO THE NUN IN CLOSEUP -- 
	she is fingering a rosary and whispering a prayer as she watches 
	them go.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. NANCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	TIGHT ON NEIL at the window, staring out at the rain.  He speaks 
	quietly, almost as if to himself.

						NEIL
			I used to think I could do something
			about it...make some kind of difference
			...but they keep slipping through my 
			fingers.

	He raises a nearly empty wineglass and drains the last sip.

	WIDER ANGLE

	The remains of a Chinese takeout dinner is spread on the floor.  
	Nancy is crouched near the fireplace, feeding paper cartons to the 
	flames.

						NANCY
			Stop blaming yourself.

						NEIL
			I'm running out of answers. A patient
			sleepwalks out of a security ward up
			to a tower with no access.  A girl, 
			alone in a room, dies by jumping six
			feet straight up into a television set.
			Nothing makes sense anymore.

						NANCY
			Then maybe you're ready.

						NEIL
			For what?

						NANCY
			The truth.

						NEIL
			Try me.

						NANCY
					(considers it)
			Only if you're willing to put aside 
			everything you've learned and trust me.
			Can you do that?

						NEIL
					(pause)
			I can do that.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - DAY

	nancy closes the door and faces the remaining kids:  Kristen, 
	Kincaid, Will, Taryn, and Joey.  Neil sits by with a clipboard on 
	his knee.  Dr. Simms is conspicuously absent.

						NEIL
			Okay.  Straigh talk only in here.

						TARYN
			Is this Group?

						NEIL
			Well, unofficially.

						WILL
			Pretty soon there won't be enough of us
			left to call it "Group."

						NEIL
			Listen up.  Nancy's got something to say.

						NANCY
					(pause)
			I know who's trying to kill you.

						KINCAID
			Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in 
			the mood.

						NANCY
			He wears a dirty brown hat.
					(this gets their attention)
			He's horribly burned.
					(all eyes on her)
			He has razors on his right hand.

						TARYN
			Who is he?

						NANCY
			Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer
			before he died.  After he died, he became
			...something worse.
					(beat)
			Six years ago Freddy killed my friends.
			He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid
			of him -- but I guess he was too strong.

	Thick silence.  The kids stare at her, flabbergasted, not knowing 
	whether to believe or doubt.  Then:

						WILL
			Why is he after us?

						TARYN
			Yeah?  What did we ever do?

						NANCY
			Not what you did.  Your parents.  My 
			parents.  They burned him alive.
			We're paying for their sins.
					(softly)
			You're the last of the Elm Street
			children.

	FAVORING THE KIDS

	as they react with bewilderment.

						WILL
					(can't grasp it)
			Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They	
			never said...

						TARYN
			Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing
			parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight
			honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers.
			Oh, by the way, your father and I torched
			some maniac last night."

						KINCAID
			So what do we do about this creep?

						NANCY
			Last time, it was me against him.  I
			wasn't strong enough...alone.

						WILL
					(catching the thread)
			But together...

						NANCY
			Kristen's the key.  She's got a very
			special talent.  A gift.

						KRISTEN
			I haven't been able to do that since
			I was a little girl.

						NANCY
			You did it the other night.

						KRISTEN
			That was different.

						NANCY
			You never lose a gift like that.  You
			just forget how to use it.
					(beat)
			How about it?  Will you try?

	Kristen nods.

						NANCY (cont.)
			Each one of you has an inner strength --
			some special power you've had in your
			most wonderful dreams.  Together we 
			can learn to use those powers...if we
			try.

						NEIL
					(muttering to Nancy)
			You sound like Peter Pan.

						NANCY
			Remember -- open mind.

						NEIL
					(dimming the lights)
			Okay, we're going to try a little group
			hypnosis.

	He turns to a high-tech chrome pendulum device sitting on the 
	tabletop and flicks a switch.  The pendulum rocks slowly from side 
	to side as a tiny blip of high intensity light flashes 
	intermittently.  Everybody stares at the device.

						NEIL (cont.)
			I want you all to follow the pendulum
			with your eyes.  Tune out everything 
			else...nothing else exists but the 
			pendulum.

						NANCY
					(softly)
			Take us there, Kristen.

						NEIL
			Breathe deeply and relax...starting with
			your toes, relax everything until there's 
			no tension left in your bodies.  None at
			all.  Keep following the pendulum...

	PANNING THE KIDS

	as they stare at the device, becoming mesmerized.

						NEIL (cont. O.S.)
			You find yourselves getting tired. 
			Nothing wuld feel better right now than
			a nice, long, deep sleep.

	ENDFRAME on Kristen.  Eyes fluttering closed.

						NEIL (cont. O.S.)
			I'm going to count backwards from five,
			and when I finish, you will all be 
			asleep.

	NANCY

	watching the pendulum, lulled under its spell.

						NEIL (cont. O.S.)
			Five...four...three...

	NEIL

	staring at the device, counting down.

						NEIL (cont.)
			...two...one.

	KRISTEN

	Her eyes snap open, she looks up.

	WIDER

	Everyone looks up.  The room is stil teh same, nothing has 
	changed.  neil switches the device off.

						KRISTEN
			I'm sorry.

	Everybody reacts, disappointed.

						NANCY
			We can try again.

						NEIL
			Everybody take five.

	Several kids stand up to stretch their legs.  Neil turns to Nancy, 
	drawing her aside.

						NEIL
			Look, I was willing to go along with this
			for the kids' peace of mind...and yours. 
			But you've got to face reality...

	JOEY

	He is at the water cooler getting a drink.  He pauses, hearing the 
	RYTHMIC SQUEAKING OF A CART.

	HIS POV

	Marcie, the cute candy-striper, appears just outside the door with 
	her cart.  She sees him and stops.

	JOEY

	gives her a goofy grin, totally in love.

	MARCIE

	looks arund to see if anybody is watching -- then smiles and 
	gestures to him.

	JOEY

	He glances around, then slips out the door unnoticed.

	INT. HALLWAY

	Marcie checks again to make sure nobody is watching, then motions 
	for Joey to follow her.

	JOEY

	hurries after her, his knees going weak.

	INT - GROUP THERAPY ROOM

	The kids are still taking a break.  neil is absently-mindedly 
	toying with the metal click-clack balls.

						NANCY
			Neil, let's try one more time.  If
			it doesn't work, then I promise --

	neil raises the end ball and sends it into the others -- instead 
	of click-clacking, they simply float apart into mid-air.

	nancy gapes as the metal balls float past her head.

	All activity comes to a standstill.  Everybody stares.

						WILL
					(realizing)
			We're here.

						TARYN
			Where...here?

						KRISTEN
			Yes.  We're in the dream.

	NEIL

	Staring at the balls, rapt and fascinated.

						NEIL
			Don't be silly...we're in Group...

						WILL (O.S.)
			In my dreams, I can walk.  My legs are
			strong.

	THE GROUP

	They all turn to see Will standing straight and tall.  No sign of 
	his wheelchair.

						WILL (cont.)
			In my dreams, I'm the Dungeonmaster.

	He plucks a metal ball from teh air, holds it in his fist, and 	
	blows in one end -- a fantasy dragonfly appears out the other.

	NANCY AND NEIL

						NANCY
			We made it.  Neil, we made it!

						NEIL
					(ducking the dragonfly)
			This isn't possible.
					(beat)
			And even if it is...what the hell am
			I doing here?
					(to Kristen)
			Did you drag me in here too?

	Kristen grins sheepishly.

						NANCY
			Try soemthing, Kristen.  What can you
			do in your dreams?

	Kristen take s afew steps back, then launches herself into a 
	perfectly executed series of twisting handflips across the room.

						WILL
			A perfct score!  The crowd goes wild!

	Kincaid picks up a metal chair and twists it open like a paperclip 
	with his bare hands.

						KINCAID
			Fuckin' A.  Dig this.

						NEIL
			Kincaid, please.  That's very unnerving.

						KINCAID
			Hey, check out Taryn.

	TARYN

	She's become a brethtaking street punk, like something out of a 
	rock fantasy:  shimmering platinum hair swept back in a wild 
	Mohawk, and sleep black leathers with delicate silver chains.

						TARYN
			In my dreams, I'm beautiful --

	She flicks out a wicked gravity knife and twirls it open faster 
	than the eye can follow.

						TARYN (cont.)
			-- and bad.

	NANCY AND NEIL

	Neil looking around, still trying to grasp it.

						NANCY
			Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream.
			Anything is possible.

						NEIL
			Anything?

	Nancy nods.

	CLOSEUP - NEIL

	He closes his eys and concentrates, trying an experiment.  He 
	opens his eyes and sees:

	NANCY

	Now wearing a frilly negligee.

						NANCY
			Very funny.

	The kids laugh and hoot.  neil blushes, very flustered.

						KINCAID
			Nice dreaming, Doc.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. DORM ROOM

	It is an unoccupied dorm room.  Marcie leads Joey in.  She closes 
	the door softly, then turns to him.

						MARCIE
			Listen, Joey...I just wanted to get you
			alone for a second.  i mean...
					(beat)
			Look, I really like you.

	She steps closer.  Joey gulps.

						MARCIE (cont.)
			Do you like me?
					(Joey nods)
			This may sound crazy, but...I make up
			excuses to come into the ward every
			day just to see you.  you're so cute.

	Joey's eyes widen.  She sits him on the bed and stands in front of 
	him.

						MARCIE (cont.)
			I could get into a lot of trouble for
			this, but I know you won't say anything.
			Will you?

	Joey shakes his head violently.  She turns her back to him.

						MARCIE (cont.)
			Unzip me.

	Joey reaches up and unzips her with shaking hands.

	She turns back and shrugs off ehr uniform.  She is wearing only 
	skimpy panties.  She is magnificent.

						MARCIE
					(coy smile)
			Do you like my body, Joey?

	Joey is overwhelmed.

	Marcie pushes Joey gently back on the bed and crawls on top of him 
	with sinewy grace.  SHe starts unbuttoning his shirt and kissing 
	his chest.

	CLOSER

	Marcie kisses his mouth, her tongue probing deeply.

	Too deeply.  Joey gags and draws back -- but Marcie's tongue grows 
	supernaturally long and burrows deeper into his mouth.

	CLOSEUP - JOEY

	Choking.  he grabs the writhing tongue and tries to pull it out of 
	his mouth.

	CLOSEUP - MARCI

	The tail end of her tongue leaps out of her mouth with a life of 
	its own.

	ON JOEY

	Both ens of the tongue/creature whip around his wrist and yank it 
	back, twining around the bedpost like a bullwhip.

	MARCIE

	A second hideously long tongue shoots out of her mouth, throught 
	the air --

	JOEY

	-- and lashes his other arm to the other bedpost with a THWACK!  
	Freddy's maniacal LAUGHTER rings out.  joey looks up.

	JOEY'S POV

	Marcie's head has been replaced by Freddy's -- his grotesque 
	laughing face perched atop her lovely body.

						FREDDY/MARCIE
					(gleefully)
			What's wrong, Joey?  I thought you liked
			my body!

	CLOSEUP - FREDDY

	Two more tongues fly from his mouth simultaneously.

	JOEY'S FEET

	are lashed to the footboard bedposts.

	HIGH ANGLE

	Looking directly down on Joey writhing on the bed.  The mattress 
	drops away beneath him, descending a shaft exactly it's size.  The 
	mattress is engulfed in a fiery inferno below.  CRANE UP as Joey 
	is left suspended over a hellish pit of flame, trying desperately 
	to scream.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. GROUP THERAPY

	The lights suddenly dim and flicker out.  Everybody comes to a 
	standstill, looking around apprehensively.

						NEIL
			What's happening?

						KRISTEN
			He's close...

						NANCY
			Freddy?

						KRISTEN
			He's heavy in the halls...

						TARYN
					(realizing)
			Where's Joey?

	They glance around -- Joey's not with them.

						KRISTEN
			Freddy's got him!  We've got to help him!

	Neil grabs the door to throw it open -- but yanks his hand back as 
	the knob glows red hot.  The door begins to scorch and sizzle as 
	the room turns stifling hot.

						WILL
			The room's changing!

	The walls begin to close in -- the group is backed into the center 
	of the room as it becomes rounded, cylindrical...like the inside 
	of a furnace.  Rivets appear as the walls become scorched steel 
	plate.  Neil staggers back.

						NEIL
			This is crazy...crazy...

	He looks down --

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	-- his feet are slogging through smouldering ash.  He steps on a 
	child's charred ribcage -- it crumbles and snaps underfoot like a 
	brittle leaf.  A tiny skull is churned up.

	KINCAID

	hunkers down and tries to push through the steel door, but jumps 
	back as his hands are burned.

	THE GROUP

	looks about helplessly as the smoke gets denser.  ROARING flames 
	leap up around them.  Suddnely --

	THE FURNACE DOOR

	slams open to reveal Simms standing in a perfectly normal hospital 
	hallway.  Total silence.

						SIMMS
			What's going on in here?

	REVERSE ANGLE

	The Group Therapy Room.  Neil, Nancy, and the others are seated in 
	their chairs, heads coming up as the awaken.  They gaze around, 
	still confused.

						SIMMS (cont.)
			What's wrong with Joey?

	Joey is lying unconscious on the floor near his chair, arms and 
	legs spread-eagle (in the same pose as being lashed to the bed).  
	Simms rushes over and checks him.

						SIMMS (cont.)
			He's not breathing!

	Neil pushes her out of the way and kneels over Joey, desperately 
	giving him mouth-to-mouth.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. INTENSIVE CARE - NIGHT

	TIGHT ON JOEY lying in a coma, hooked up to monitoring devices and 
	a respirator.  ANGLE WIDENS SLOWLY as we DOLLY BACK, revealing a 
	team of TECHNICIANS and NUEROSURGEONS surrounding the bed.

	CONTINUE DOLLYING BACK until we find ourselves IN THE HALLWAY 
	outside the room.  neil and Nancy hover by the door, sick with 
	worry.  DOCTOR CARVER (60's), the supervising physician of Westin 
	Hills, is stewing in controlled anger.  Dr. Simms is self-
	righteous now that her predicted disaster has taken place.

	The nuerosurgeons exit the room.					
	NUEROSURGEON
					(shakes his head)
			He's in a deep coma.  There's nothing
			we can do for him.

	The nurosurgeons walk away.  Carver turn to Neil.

						CARVER
			This is insexcusable.

						SIMMS
			The session was unauthorized.  It was
			purposely conducted without my knowledge.

						NEIL
			Unusual steps were called for.

						CARVER
			Is that what I should tell this young 
			man's parents?
					(beat)
			I understand you prescribed a highly 
			experimental drug.

						NANCY
			Dr. Carver, he's not in a coma because
			of the Hypnocyl.

						CARVER
			Young lady, your opinion is of no 
			interest to me.  Furthermore, 
			according to Dr. Simms, you've been
			creating panic among the patients.

						NEIL
			That's not true.

						CARVER
			Dr. Goldman, in the last four days we've
			had two suicides.  Now a boy is in a 
			coma.  I think it's fair to say your
			approach has failed...entirely.
					(beat)
			You're both relieved of your duties.
			I want you out of here.  Today.

						NANCY
			Dr. Carver --

	Neil motions her quiet.  Carver exits.

						SIMMS
			I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on
			yourself.

						NEIL
					(softly)
			For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try
			to help the kids, will you?  Listen
			to them.

						SIMMS
					(softening)
			Of course.

	She exits.  Only Nancy and Neil remain.

						NANCY
			What are we going to do?

						NEIL
					(softly)
			There's nothing we can do.  It's out of
			our hands.

	He walks away.  She watches his go, then look in Joey.  She is 
	desolate.

										     CUT TO:

	EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

	Neil has packed several boxes of personal files into the trunk of 
	his BMW.  He places the final box in -- it's stuffed with drawings 
	from the kids...and some photographs.

	INSERT - THE PHOTOGRAPH ON TOP

	A picture of a group picnic -- featuring Neil with Jennifer and 
	Phillip.

	CLOSEUP - NEIL

	stares sadly at the picture for an extended beat.

	LOW ANGLE

	As Neil slams the trunk, the unused wing of the hospital is 
	revealed in the background.  It is old, untended, crumbling.  A 
	shrouded white figure is standing in one of the upper floor 
	windows.

	NEIL

	sees the figure and reacts, startled.

	THE FIGURE IN THE WINDOW

	is the nun from the funeral.  She has been staring out the window 
	at him.  She turns away and disappears from view.

	NEIL

	pauses for a moment, then approaches the building.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Neil comes to a set of double doors and rattles them -- they're 
	sealed with a rusty chain and padlock.

	He moves to a broken window and peers through the boards nailed 
	across it.

	NEIL'S POV

	He can see into the long main hallway of the ground floor.  He 
	gets a brief glimpse of the nun at the far end as she comes down 
	the stairs, turns on the landing, and heads downstairs to the 
	basement.

	NEIL

						NEIL
					(knocking on the board)
			Sister?  Sister!

	She hasn't heard him.  He pries the loose board away and enters 
	through the window.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. OLD WING - BASEMENT LEVEL - NIGHT

	A forgotten, dusty corridor with peeled paint like parchment on 
	the water-stained walls.  Neil comes down the stairs, peering 
	around in the gloom.

	The only feature in the dead end hallway is a partially open rusty 
	iron door with a small barred window.  A FAINT BUZZING rises and 
	falls from within.

						NEIL
			Excuse me.  Sister?

	No answer.  Just another swell of FAINT BUZZING.  Neil approaches 
	the door and pushes it open all the way.  It SQUEALS LOUDLY on its 
	hinges.

	INT. ROOM

	Neil enters a huge, shadowy, dungeon-like room.  Flaking cement 
	pillars stand draped with cobwebs.  Rusted remains of bedframes 
	and scraps of wood litter the floor.  The BUZZING grows louder, 
	then falls away again.

						NEIL (cont.)
			Hello?

	A wooden match ignites near him, going off like a gunshot in the 
	stillness -- the nun is reavealed.  Neil gasps, startled.

						NUN
			This is where it began.

	She turns and lights a candle in a tiny alcove before a statue of 
	the Virgin Mary.  Dim light sputters up.

						NEIL
			This wing's been closed for years.
					(looking around)
			What was this place?

						NUN
			Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of
			men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst
			of the criminally insane, were locked
			away in here like animals.

						NEIL
			The whole facility was shut down in the
			Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of 
			scandal...

						NUN
					(she nods)
			A young girl on the staff was accidentally
			locked in here over the holidays.  The 
			inmates managed to keep her hidden for
			days.  She was raped...hundreds of times.
			When they found her, she was barely 
			alive...and with child.

						NEIL
					(softly)
			My God.

						NUN
			That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her 
			child --

						NEIL
			Freddy.

						NUN
			The bastard son of a hundred maniacs.
			Some say he was murdered, though no 
			body was ever found.

	Neil is momentarily distracted by another swell of BUZZING.  A fly 
	brushes past his face in the darkness.

						NEIL
			You said something before...about 
			laying him to rest...?

						NUN
			You must find the remains...and bury
			them in hallowed ground.

	The nun turns and climbs the stairs.

						NEIL
					(blankly)
			Hallowed ground?

	he moves to follow her, but his foot comes in contact with 
	something near the bottom of the steps.  The BUZZING SWELLS UP 
	LOUDLY.  He jumps back.

	NEIL'S POV

	The grisly carcass of a cat stares up at Neil, hundreds of flies 
	swarming in its dessicated flesh.

	THE NUN

	Pausing at the top of the stairs.

						NUN
			If your only faith is science, Doctor...
			it may be you that's laid to rest.

	As she exits, the door begins to CREAK slowly shut behind her, 
	plunging the room into darkness.

	NEIL

	scrambles up the steps and grabs the door just before it closes 
	shut.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	Neil heaves a sigh of relief as he exits the Pit.  He looks 
	around.  The nun has disappeared.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. INTENSIVE CARE - DAY

	Nancy sits at Joey's bedside, gazing at the boy -- so still, so 
	frail.  She speaks in a whisper, but her voice is fierce.

						NANCY
			Let him go, you bastard.

	ON JOEY

	Short slashes suddenly begin to criss-cross his smooth chest.

	NANCY

	reacts in horror.  Neil enters B.G.

						NANCY
			Neil...

	He comes to her side and looks down.

	JOEY

	The slashes spell out a message in crude, bloody letters:  "COME

						NEIL
			You're not going in.  That's exactly what
			he wants.  As long as you're on Hypnocyl,
			it's the only way he can get to you.

						NANCY
			Don't you think I know that?  I don't 
			have any choice.

						NEIL
			Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't
			do the kids any good.  Besides, we do
			have a choice.

						NANCY
			Assuming your mysterious nun in right.

						NEIL
			I've heard crazier things this week.

						NANCY
			All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit
			she seems to know more about Krueger
			than I do.

						NEIL
			The question is, what happened to Freddy's
			body?

						NANCY
			They burned him to death in his boiler
			room, but they were smart enough to 
			hide the remains.

						NEIL
			Who would know where they were hidden?

						NANCY
					(pause)
			There's only one man...and its time for
			him to talk.

	INT - HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

	TIGHT ON Kristen's face as she lets out a WAIL of total anguish 
	and despair -- she struggles with Max and Lorenzo as they try to 
	restrain her.

						KRISTEN
			NOOOOOOOO!

	WIDER

	Simms is standing by, watching the struggle.

						KRISTEN (cont.)
			You can't send them away!  You can't!
			They're all we have!

						SIMMS
			They weren't helping you, Kristen.
			You're a sick girl.  You can only get
			better if you trust me now.

	Kristen is fighting like a wildcat -- momentum carries her and the 
	orderlies into the nurse's desk and sends them sprawling in a 
	shower of desktop items.

	She hurls a heavy stapler in Simms' direction before Max and 
	Lorenzo grab her again -- they manage to pin her arms, but barely.

	THE KIDS

	are peering fearfully up the hall at the spectacle.

	FAVORING SIMMS

						SIMMS
			Get her to the Quiet Room and sedate

	Kristen is dragged down the hall, fighting and kicking every inch 
	of the way.

	"Tavern" is too nice a word -- it is a dive bar with a flickering 
	neon sign on the worst side of town.

	INT. LITTLE NEMO'S

	The sort of place you wind up when you have no place left to go.

	A dark, grubby figure sits in the deep foreground nursing a beer 
	and staring at nothing.  His unshaven face is hard and bitter, 
	haunted by old sorrows.  He wears a sodden, rumpled 
	nightwatchman's uniform.

						NANCY (O.S.)
			Hello Father.

	DONALD THOMPSON looks up slowly from his beer.

	WIDER ANGLE

	Nancy stands nearby with Neil.  Thompson smiles wanly.

						THOMPSON
			Well, if it isn't my little girl...
			come to visit her Daddy.

						NANCY
			It's been a long time.

						THOMPSON
			Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so
			lucky?  I thought you were trying to 
			forget I was alive.

						NANCY
			That's not true.  You're the one who's 
			trying to forget.

	She sits across from him.  Neil hovers at her side.

						NANCY (cont.)
			I need your help.  Krueger's back.

						THOMPSON
					(chuckles)
			Fred Krueger's dead.  You always had a 
			little trouble understanding that,
			Princess.

						NANCY
			You know what he did.  He's doing it
			again.

						NEIL
			She's telling the truth.

	Thompson's eye flick up at Neil.

						THOMPSON
					(low, dangerous)
			I don't recall as we ever met, friend.
			And I don't believe this is any of 
			your goddamn business.

	Neil is taken aback for a moment -- he's about to retort, but 
	Nancy silences him with a look.  She leans in to her father.

						NANCY
			I think we can stop him this time.  
			Stop him for good.  But we need to 
			know where the bones were hidden.

						THOMPSON
					(slow, measured)
			I lost too much over this already.  I'm
			through with it.

						NANCY
			People are still dying.  After all this
			time.  Stop running away from it.
					(no response)
			Daddy, please...don't make me beg.
					(still no response)
			You owe me.

	Thompson meets his daughter's gaze, then averts his eyes.  He 
	takes a slow draw on his drink.

						THOMPSON (cont.)
			It's been nice seeing you, baby.
			Don't stay away so long next time.

	Nancy can't handle another moment -- she bolt from the table as 
	tears come.  Neil glares at Thompson and hurries after her.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Neil folllows her to the restroom alcove, where she is trying to 
	pull herself together.

						NEIL
			Nancy...

						NANCY
			I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.

	He wants to comfort her, but doesn't really have the words.  He 
	stands by, looking miserable.  His BEEPER GOES OFF.  He checks it 
	for the number and crosses to the payphone.

			No...

			You go.

	She stares at him, not understanding.

						NEIL (cont.)
			I'm gonna get the remains.

						NANCY
					(indicating her father)
			Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.

						NEIL
			Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her
			awake somehow.
					(Nancy tries to argue)
			Do it.

	Nancy takes the keys.  Their eyes lock for a long, intense moment 
	-- then they share a spontaneous, passionate kiss.

	Nancy turns and leaves without another word.

	ANGLE ON THOMPSON

	He sees his daughter leave, then turns his blank gaze back to his 
	beer.

	Neil casually walks over.  Thompson ignores him.

						NEIL
			I'm Neil Goldman.  Pleased to meet you.
					(beat)
			There, we've met.

	Suddenly, unexpectedly, Neil lashes viciously out with his foot 
	and kicks the table over -- everything goes flying.  Before 
	Thompson can so much as blink, neil hauls him out of his chair and 
	slams him violently against the wall.

	TIGHT TWO SHOT

	Neil and Thompson, nose to nose.  Neil speaks with barely 
	contained rage.

						NEIL
					(low, tight)
			Listen up, asshole.  I don't know if

						THOMPSON
					(dourly regards teh church)
			What the hell are we doing here?

	Neil reaches over, shuts off the ignition, and takes the key.  
	There is a pint bottle of whiskey juting from Thompson's jacket 
	pocket.  Neil snatches the bottle before Thompson can react.

						THOMPSON (cont.)
			Hey!

						NEIL
			I won't be long.

	Neil gets out of the car.  he empties the contents of the pint 
	bottle on the pavement as he hurries toward the church.

	INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

	Three WORSHIPPERS are seated in the pews, seeking comfort in 
	silent prayer.  Neil rushes in at the back of the church.

	CLOSER - NEIL

	sees a small basin of holy water attached to the wall.  he 
	submerges Thompson's bottle, filling it with holy water.  He caps 
	the bottle, pockets it, then proceeds up the aisle.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Neil comes to a candle shrine.  A foot-high crucifix is attached 
	to the wall above it.  He grabs the cross and tries to lift it off 
	its mount -- it comes loose with a loud CLANG, a lift it off its 
	mount -- it comes loose with a loud CLANG, a jarring sound in the 
	silent church.  Worshippers turn to look.

	Feeling comspicuous, Neil turns to find himself facing a PRIEST.

						NEIL
			Oh.  Hello.

						PRIEST
			What do you think you're doing?

						NEIL
			Look, I'm sorry, but I need this...

	Max shakes his head.

						NANCY (cont.)
			You don't understand -- 

	The big man holds up his hand for silence.

						MAX
			Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr.
			Simms gave me specific instructions.
			Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially
			you.  She made that real clear.

			But Max, she needs me.  It could mean

	Max pauses briefly...and decides to speak his mind.

						MAX
					(softly)
			Look, I think you really mean well...

	Nancy backs down.  There's no way she'll get past him.

						NANCY
			Okay, Max...I understand.
					(a plea)
			Can I say goodbye to the others?

	Max wavers, his emotions getting to him.

			It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?

	It's against his better judgement, but Max finally nods.

	slavering just inches from his face, rattling the chain link 
	fence.

						THOMPSON
					(unruffled)
			Hey, Jesse James.  Don't you remember

	He swings the gate open and offers an open hand to the dog.  Jesse 
	sniffs the hand suspiciously, then wags his tail.

						THOMPSON (cont.)
			That a boy.

	He turns, motioning to Neil to bring the car through.  Neil scoots 
	to the driver's side.

	WIDER ANGLE

	Neil pulls the car in and stops at the mouth of the maze.  
	Thompson secures the gate.

	INT. CAR

	Thompson gets back in on the passenger side.  Neil is suddenly 
	playing chauffer.

						THOMPSON
			All right.  It's deep in the heart of this
			place.  Take it slow.

	Neil eases on the gas.

	Nancy closes the door and turns to the kids.  They look to her, 
	waiting.

						NANCY
			Okay, straight talk only in here.

						TARYN
			What about Kristen?

						NANCY
			We can't get to her.  I've tried.

	She dims the lights and goes to the pendulum device.

						NANCY (cont.)
			I was hoping we'd have more time to 
			learn how to use the dreams...
					(beat)
			But Joey's in there.  And Kristen's 
			going in with or without us.  They need
			us.

						WILL
			You mean we're gonna try to go in with
			her?  To link up?

						NANCY
			It's now or never.  I won't kid you.
			This is as dangerous as it gets.  If
			you die in the dream, it's for real.
			Nobody has to go in that doesn't want
			to.

	THE KIDS

	A long silence.  Their faces reflect conflicting emotions.  Fear, 
	dread, anticipation.  Then, quietly:

						WILL
			I'm in.

						TARYN
			Me too.

						KINCAID
			Let's go kick that motherfucker's ass all
			over dreamland.

	Her face reflects the same emotions -- but mostly, there is pride 
	in the kids.  She turns the pendulum on and sits with them.

						NANCY
			Now remember -- whatever happens, stay
			together.  That's the only way we can 
			beat him.

	THE GROUP

	Staring intensely at the pendulum.

						NANCY
					(softly)
			Clear your minds...of everything.

	EXT. AUTO GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

	Thompson's car pulls slowly around a tight corner and stos in what 
	amounts to a small clearing deep in the labyrinth of stacked 
	autos.

	Thompson and Neil get out, the weak headlights of teh old Dodge 
	illminating the towering heaps of rusted metal surrounding them.  
	Thompson peers around, then points.

						THOMPSON
			That's it.  The Caddy.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	The rear end of a ravaged 59 Cadillac sticks out from beneath a 
	huge stack of automotive carcasses, its rusted tailfins jutting 
	like the spines of some prehistoric beast.

	Neil crosses to the car and runs his hands over the corroded 
	surface of the trunk.  He tries to lift it, but it's locked tight.

	THOMPSON

	stands beside the Dodge.  He takes a swig from a pint bottle and 
	glances around into the darkness nervously.

	NEIL

	finds a large four-pronged tire iron -- three ends for lug nuts, 
	the other end a sharp wedge.  He jams it under teh trunk lid and 
	applies pressure.

	CLOSEUP - THOMPSON

	observing nervously.

	NEIL

	leans his head closer to the trunk as he strains against the tire 
	iron.

	CLOSEUP - THE LOCK

	explodes in a cloud of rust.

	CLOSEUP - NEIL

	Gazing in.  PAN TO an ancient, crusty burlap sack lying in the 
	shadows of the trunk.

	INT. THOMPSON'S DODGE

	Thompson silently eases behind the wheel of his Dodge, careful not 
	to draw Neil's attention.  he's going to get the hell out of 
	here 	--

	-- but there are no keys in the ignition.  Thompson looks up, 
	glaring at Neil through the windshield.

	EXT. DODGE

	Neil holds up Thompson's keys.

						NEIL
			Going somewhere?

	Thompson gets out of the car.

						THOMPSON
			I showed you where the goddamn thing was.
			I didn't say I'd stick around.

	Neil tosses Thompson a shovel.

						NEIL
			We've got work to do.

			What are you talking about?

			You're about to attend a funeral.  One

	Nancy's voice is a soft hush.  They are being lulled into the

	Nancy and the others are now in the Wuiet Room with Kristen.  
	Kristen looks around, crying and happy that her friends are here.  
	She hugs them in turn -- a sweet, teary reunion.

			I knew you'd come.

	THE WALL

	Four huge razors slash through the canvas -- RIIIIIIP!  Cotton 
	padding flies.

	THE GROUP

	reacts as teh razors vanish -- then RIP from the wall directly 
	behind them.  Everyone moves to the center of the room.

						NANCY
			Whatever happens, stay together!

	VARIOUS ANGLES

	Cotton padding billows through the air as the razors slash through 
	the wall again and again -- from in front, from behind, from the 
	side, from the floor, from everywhere.

	The Quiet room becomes a white void of ripping and slashing -- a 
	vicious blizzard of whirling padding.

	WILL

	The blades lash out from the billowing clouds of cotton.  He's 
	forced back.

	TARYN

						NANCY
					(shielding her eyes)
			HOLD HANDS!  FIND EACH OTHER!

	KRISTEN

	Screaming, panicking, spun around in the blizzard.  Lost.

						KRISTEN
			NANCY!

	CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

	The blizzard of cotton padding dissipates and slowly vanishes.  
	Kristen looks up a dream.

	ANGLE WIDENS SLOWLY OUT to reveal Kristen sitting at her drafting 
	table in her bedroom at home.  The crude paper mache Elm Street 
	House model is in front of her, still under construction.  Warren 
	Zevon's "I'll Sleep When I'm Dead" still blares from the radio.

	Nothing has changed.  She's still home.  Safe.  She wonders if all 
	of it, everything, has been nothing but a bad dream.

	Her mother enters, dressed in the same beautiful evening gown, and 
	snaps the radio off.

						ELAINE
			Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!

						KRISTEN
					(bleary-eyed)
			Mom?

						ELAINE
			What are you still doing up?  It's past 
			one.

						KRISTEN
			I thought I'd wait for you.

						ELAINE
					(touched)
			Well, I'm home now, so you can go right
			to sleep.  C'mon, angel.

	She turns down teh covers.  Kristen crawls onto the bed and throws 
	her arms around Elaine's neck in a spontaneous hug.

						ELAINE (cont.)
			What's that for?

						KRISTEN
			I'm just glad you're home.

	Elaine gives her a kiss and tucks her in.  She goes to teh door 
	and reaches for the lightswitch.

						KRISTEN (cont.)
			Mom?

						ELAINE
					(pauses in doorway)
			What?

						KRISTEN
			I had such an awful dream.

	A MAN'S VOICE comes from downstairs:

						MAN (O.S.)
			Elaine?  Where do you keep the bourbon?

						ELAINE
			I'll be right down.
					(to Kristen)
			Kris, I've got a guest.

						KRISTEN
			Can we talk?  Just for a minute?

						ELAINE
			Can't it wait till morning?

						KRISTEN
			Please Mom?  I just don't want to be 
			alone.

	Suddenly, Elaine is violently yanked out the door, revealing:

	FREDDY

	framed in the doorway, wearing immaculate formal wear, screaming 
	at Elaine (she's off camera).

						FREDDY
			BITCH!  I SAID WHERE'S THE FUCKING 
			BOURBON!

	He sweeps his razors down at her.

	KRISTEN

	SCREMING in bed.

	FREDDY

	Grinning insanely, he leans into the room, holding Elaine's 
	decapitated head up for Kristen.

						FREDDY
			You should listen to your mother,
			Kristen.

	CLOSEUP - ELAINE'S HEAD

	Dangling in Freddy's grasp, blood dripping from the neck, it 
	jabbers at Kristen in a glassy-eyed harangue.

						ELAINE'S HEAD
			Gaddamn it Kristen, you always ruin
			everything!  Every time I have a man 
			over you spoil it!  You know what 
			your shrink said!  You're only trying
			to get attention!

	KRISTEN

	screaming and screaming.

	FREDDY

	drops the head and lunges at her, claws swiping the air.

	KRISTEN

	rolls out of bed as Freddy's claws tear her pillow open in an 
	explosion of feathers.

	WIDER

	Kristen turns and runs, Freddy right on her heels,  his finger 
	blades mere inches from her back.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Kristen's momentum takes her right up the wall -- she pushes off 
	in an incredible gymnast's flip, hurtling up in an arc back over 
	Freddy's head -- Freddy hits the wall, his finger-razors burying 
	deep in the plaster.

	KRISTEN

	makes a perfect landing near her bed and snatches up her 
	bedspread.

	FREDDY

	howls with rags and yanks his razors from the wall in an explosion 
	of plaster.  he whirls and dives at Kristen --

	-- as she flings the bedspread over him.  He tangles up, going 
	down hard, thrashing to get free.

	KRISTEN 

	hurtles herself out the window in an explosion of glass.

	FREDDY

	Ripping and slashing,  he wrestles the bedspread off and hurls it 
	away in tatters.  He looks aroudn, howling with rage.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - NIGHT

	Kristen EXPLODES through a skylight in the living room ceiling and 
	drops to teh floor in a rain of glass.  Bruised and battered, she 
	rises to her feet and looks around.  Lost.  Alone.

						KRISTEN
					(calling out)
			Nancy!

										     CUT TO:

	INT. ELM STREET HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Whirling cotton fills the screen...dissipating to reveal Taryn in 
	her full dream warrior splendor, platinum crest of hair 
	shimmering.  She finds herself in a twisting hallway in teh 
	dreamscape -- and hears KRISTEN'S FAINT CALL.

						TARYN
					(calling out)
			Kristen?  Is that you?

	She hurries up a passageway and turns a corner.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Freddy leaps from the darkness, blades flashing.

	Taryn nimbly dodges and whirls, producing two large gravity 
	knives.  She click-clacks them open, twirling them expertly.

						TARYN
			Okay asshole.  Let's dance.

	Freddy gives her an evil smile and squares off against her.

	They circle each otehr slowly...then Freddy lashes out.

	Taryn ducks and cuts deeply across Freddy's ribs.

	Freddy SCREAMS with anger and swipes twice more, ripping deep 
	gouges in Taryn's shoulder.

	Taryn draws back, keeping her guard up.  She feints, then strikes 
	out, slashing Freddy again.

	This time Freddy draws back.

						FREDDY
			Taryn...why should we fight?  You and
			I are old friends.

	Taryn stands poised, ready for anything.

	CLOSEUP - FREDDY

						FREDDY
					(grinning)
			Let's get high.

	He raises his hands into frame -- his fingerhave all turned into 
	oversized hypodermic neeles, their needle-sharp tips glittering in 
	the darkness.

	TARYN

	Revolted by teh weird display.  She looks down, feeling something 
	strange.

	CLOSEUP - TARYN'S ARMS

	Her needle track scars are expanding and contracting like tiny 
	sucking mouths...hungry...

	WIDER

	The instant her guard is down, Freddy lunges at her and buries 
	both sets of hypodermic fingers into her arms, pinning her to the 
	wall.  Taryn SCREAMS.

	CLOSEUP - HYPO FINGERS

	As their inner plunges depress, Taryn's biceps swell grotesquely, 
	veins bulging impossibly.

	TARYN

	We can actually see the high-pressure fluid travel upward as her 
	veins and body balloon, racing from her arms -- her neck swells -- 
	temples expand -- eyeballs bulge --

	Then the top of her head literally exploded.

	CLOSEUP - FREDDY

						FREDDY
			What a rush.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. ELM STREET BASEMENT - NIGHT

	MOVING WITH Will -- he holds a torch high in one hand, a saber in 
	the other.  He looks like a thin pirate out of a Dungeons and 
	Dragons game.

						WILL
					(calling out)
			Hello?  You guys, where are you?

	He heas a SOUND somewhere in the darkness ahead.  He 
	pauses...nothing.  Suddenly, there's a SOUND OF SCREECHING METAL 
	and a strange object comes racing out of the darkness at him.  He 
	lunges out of the way.

	THE OBJECT

	screeches to a halt and wheels about.  It's an oversiezed, 
	nightmarish version of Will's wheelchair -- made of rusty, twisted 
	metal and bristling with spikes and hooks.  To sit in it would be 
	agonizing death.

						FREDDY (O.S.)
			You look tired, Will.  Have a seat.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	Will whirls about to see Freddy leaning nonchalantly against a 
	pillar.

						WILL
					(shaken)
			No thanks.  I'm fine just the way I am.

						FREDDY
			For now.  But when you wake up...
					(singing)
			...you're back in the saddle again.

	Will is visibly upset by this -- and reacts too slowly as the 
	wheelchair bears down on him again.

	WILL

	is sideswiped and knocked to the ground, his leg bleeding.

	THE CHAIR

	spins around, preparing for another run.

	FREDDY

						FREDDY
			It's the chair for you, kid.

	THE CHAIR

	The wheels smoke, burning rubber as it launches itself at Will.

	CLOSEUP - WILL

						WILL
					(softly, to himself)
			I'm the Dungeonmaster...the Dungeonmaster...

	WIDER

	Will suddenly levitates to his feet.  A wizard's robe swirls about 
	him as crackling electricity plays across his fingertips, just 
	like the illustration on the Dungeonmaster game card.

	LOW ANGLE

	The wheelchair ROARS over camera.

	WILL

	Green lightning explodes from his fingertips and shatters the 
	wheelchair into fragments.

	FREDDY

	reacts in surprise.

	WILL

	looks up at Freddy, grinning with his newfound power.  The dancing 
	lights emanating from his fingers cast a weird glow across his 
	face.

						WILL
			In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves --
			demon begone!

	WIDER

	Will rushes at Freddy, shooting wizard's fire.  The crackling 
	green energy engulfs Freddy completely --

	-- but Freddy grabs Will by the front of his shirt and lifts him 
	off the ground.

	CLOSER

	Freddy snarls into Will's face as the living energy twines around 
	him.

						FREDDY
			Sorry kid.  I don't believe in fairy 
			tales.

	Freddy buries his claws in Will's chest -- the blades points jut 
	out of Will's back as his death cry ECHOES down teh halls.

									           CUT TO:

	INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - NIGHT

	Kristen wanders through the twisting distorted hallways of the 
	dreamscape.  She hears Will's SCREAM echo and fade away.

						KRISTEN
			HELLO?  ANYBODY?

						NANCY'S VOICE
					(faint, faraway)
			Kristen?

	She turns a corner and sees Nancy at the end of a hallway.

						KRISTEN (cont.)
			Nancy!

	They rush toward each other -- but stop as they hear a strange 
	CRUNCHING SOUND.

						KRISTEN
			What's that?

						NANCY
			I don't know.

	The SOUND comes again -- a horrible CRACKING AND SNAPPING.  The 
	wall begins to spiderweb with cracks as it bulges outward.  
	Something big seems to be trying to press through to cut them off 
	from each other.  Nancy and Kristen back away warily.

	Suddenly, there is an EXPLOSION of wood and plaster -- and Kincaid 
	steps through.

						KINCAID
					(grinning)
			Yo.  I thought I heard voices.

	Nancy and Kristen yell with delight.  Kristen throws her arms 
	around him.

						KRISTEN
			Kincaid!  I could kiss you!

						KINCAID
			What's stopping you?

	Kristen is taken aback for a moment -- then gives him a chaste but 
	sincere kiss on the mouth.  He grins.

						KINCAID
			Cool.  So where's Joey?

						KRISTEN
			I don't know.  It's like a maze in here.

						KINCAID
			Then it's time to stop guessin' and
			start messin'.
					(hollering)
			FREDDY!  WHERE YOU HIDING, YOU PUSSY?

						NANCY
			Kincaid -- we should find the others
			first...

						KINCAID
			YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID --
			LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!
					(silence)
			KRUEGER!

	Still no response.

						KINCAID (cont.)
					(muttering)
			I knew he was chickensh--

	Suddenly, the lights around them flinker and dim.  They hear a 
	DEEP, REVERBERATING GROAN OF METAL.  All look over the railing.

	OVER THE SHOULDER

	as they peer downward.  Where before there was nothing, there are 
	now two huge, rusty boiler room doors slowly swinging open like 
	the entrance to Hell.  Orange light flickers from below.

	KINCAID

	Still finishing his prior statement.

						KINCAID
			-- shhhiiiiit.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	The tree slowly descend teh stairs, all bravado lost.  They stop 
	before the immense gate.  Within lies flickering darkness and 
	twisting steps leading down.

						NANCY
			This is it.  Are you ready?

	Kristen nods.

						KINCAID
			Let's snuff the fucker.

	They descend.

	INT. BOILER ROOM - ENTRANCE

	Nancy, Kristen, and Kincaid cautiously come down the winding 
	stairs and pass under an arch way made of twisted, scorched 
	tricycles and shattered dolls.

	They exchange worried looks, then step through.

	MASTER

	A surrealistic boiler room, air red with heat and haze.

	Freddy sits on a throne made of children's skulls and bones.

	Joey is nearby, suspended over the pit of flames like a weird 
	altar.

	Welcome to Freddy Hell.

	FREDDY

						FREDDY
					(low gutteral chuckle)
			Look Joey...all the little piggies have
			come home.

	JOEY

	He turns his terrified, pleading eyes toward his friends.  His 
	skin is hot and blistered.  The tongues that lash his hands and 
	feet to the four posts are writhing slowly, licking his ankles and 
	wrists.  He opens his mouth in a mute, silent scream.

	NANCY, KRISTEN, KINCAID

						KRISTEN
					(softly)
			Joey...

	Nancy steps forward.

						NANCY
			Let him go.

	THE THRONE

	Freddy sweeps his hands, the obedient servant.

						FREDDY
			Your wish is my command.

	He makes a gesture.

	JOEY

	The tongue/creature securing his left wrist unravels -- he drops 
	precariously.  The other tongues begin to loosen their hold.

	NANCY

	lunges to the edge of the pit, reaching for Joey.

	FREDDY

	laughs maniacally.

	THE PIT

	The last tongues give way and Joey drops --

	-- just as Nancy snatches his wrist and hangs on.  Kincaid grabs 
	Nancy by the belt and hauls them both back out.

	KRISTEN

	With a cry, she runs and does a double flip over the burning 
	pit -- right at Freddy.

	THE THRONE

	Kristen snap-kicks right into Freddy's face, toppling him and the 
	throne backwards.

	KINCAID

	strains as he rips a six-foot section of pipe from the wall and 
	races toward the throne.

	NANCY

	helps Joey to his feet just as a tongue/creature flies out of the 
	darkness and whips around her neck, strangling her.

	FREDDY

	rises from the rubble of his throne and lashes at Kristen.  She 
	flips over his head -- but Freddy backhands her, sending her 
	spinning across the room.

	NANCY

	Clutching one end of the writhing tongue, she forces it to the 
	ground.  She grabs a furnace poker and skewers the creature.  It 
	instantly unravels from her neck.

	THE FALLEN THRONE

	As Freddy prepares to slash Kristen, Kincaid races in, swinging 
	his pipe in a wide arc.  It smashes across Freddy's back, driving 
	him to his knees.

	Kincaid raises the pipe for a second blow, but Freddy leaps up 
	with a ROAR and grabs Kincaid, hauling him high over his head.

	Nancy rushes in just as Freddy's arms are extended and plunges the 
	poker into his heart.

	Everyone freezes.

	FREDDY

	looks down at the poker with an exaggerated gasp -- then flashes a 
	grin at Nancy.

	NANCY

	reacts in horror.

	FREDDY

	releases Kincaid's feet and holds him dangling by the throat.

	With his free hand, he pulls the poker slowly from his chest.  He 
	looks at the tip -- it glistens with dark, rancid gore.  He licks 
	it like an ice cream cone.

	NANCY AND KRISTEN

	Kristen rises, using Nancy for support.

						KRISTEN
			Nancy!

						NANCY
			He's too strong!  He was never this
			strong!

	FREDDY

	whirls to her, Kincaid still choking in his upraised fist.

						FREDDY
					(hissing)
			Yesss!  The souls of the children...

	He rips his shirt open, revealing his hideously scarred body.

						FREDDY (cont.)
			...they make me stronger.

	His flesh begins to undulate and swell.

	TIGHT ON FREDDY'S TORSO

	Rippling blisters appear, forming into faces -- horrible, tortured 
	faces wailing in despair.  We recognize Phillip ... Jennifer ... 
	Will ... Taryn ...

	NANCY AND KRISTEN

	Total horror and revulsion.

	CLOSEUP - FREDDY

	An insane, gleeful grin -- and a gutteral whisper:

			Always room for more.

	as neil drops it beside a freshly dug grave.  Freddy's bones 
	clatter.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. BOILER ROOM - NIGHT

	Freddy flinches in pain -- he looks up in fear, suddenly aware 
	that somebody's disturved his bones.  His fear is slowly replaced 
	by an evil, cunning grin.

	He vanishes -- Kincaid finds himself struggling and choking in 
	mid-air.  He drops to the ground, gasping for breath.

										     CUT TO:

	EXT. AUTO GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

	Thompson crawls from the shallow grave and throws the shovel 
	aside.

						THOMPSON
			What the hell good is this supposed to
			do?

	Ignoring him, Neil picks up the tire iron and holds it up.

						NEIL
			This will be our headstone.

	He jams the tire iron into the ground at the foot of the grave.  
	It looks like a cross.

						THOMPSON
					(hears something)
			What was that?

						NEIL
			What?

						THOMPSON
			Listen.

	Neil now hears the FAINT SOUND OF ROCK MUSIC on the night breeze.

						NEIL
			Somebody else is out here.

						THOMPSON
			No.  We're alone.

	Another song snaps to life -- closer to them.  The Rolling Stones'  
	"Sympathy for the Devil."

	INT. WRECKED CHEVY

	We can see Neil and Thompson through the cracked windshield of the 
	rusted-out Chevy.  The radio suddenly lights up, blaring another 
	rock song.

	NEIL AND THOMPSON

	More MUSIC comes from all around them, blasting from teh radios of 
	long-dead autos, a cacophony of rock songs from the 50's and 60's.  
	We hear the HOWLING of Wolfman Jack.

	THE CARS - VARIOUS ANGLES

	Broken headlights sputter to life.  A windshield wiper near 
	Thompson slaps madly back and forth across shattered glass.  Horns 
	honk.  An exposed fan blade WHIRRS like a buzzsaw.

	NEIL AND THOMPSON

						THOMPSON
					(hoarse whisper)
			The whole place is coming to life...

	Both men turn to look at the burlap sack.  There is a slight 
	stirring from within.

	Neil hurries over and grabs the sack to throw it into the grave.

	THE SACK

	Suddenly, a skeletal hand wearing finger-razors tears through the 
	rotted burlap and latches onto Neil's wrist.

	The sack rips wide open as Freddy's charred bones leap into 
	life -- a hideous shambling skeleton SCREAMING with unearthly 
	rage.

	THOMPSON

	Frozen  to the spot.  Can't believe his eyes.

	NEIL

	falls back, scrambling away as Freddy's blades slash the air 
	inches in front of his face.

	WIDER

	Suddenly, Jesse the junkyard dog hurtles out of the darkness onto 
	the hellish thing's back, biting and snapping.

	The skeleton pulls the dog from its back, slashes its throat in 
	one quick motion, and tosses the carcass aside.

	THOMPSON

	Something snaps in him as he glares at the skeleton.

						THOMPSON
			It's really you.

	CLOSEUP - SKELETON

	It turns and grins hideously at Thompson.

	THOMPSON

	grabs a piece of pipe and rushes the monster.

						THOMPSON
			I'll send you back to Hell here you
			belong!

	THE CREATURE 

	meets Thompson's rush head on, blocking the pipe and yanking him 
	off his feet.

	It hurls Thompson through the air with incredible force.

	THE CADILLAC

	Thompson slams into it, impaled on the tail fin.  He looks down at 
	the metal point jutting from his chest...and dies.

	NEIL

	grabs the shovel and swings it -- the skeleton ducks and slashes 
	Neil's ribs, ripping his shirt wide open.

	As Neil doubles over, the skeleton rips the shovel from his hands 
	and smashes it solidly against his head.  Before Neil can crumple, 
	the creature straightens him up with a second vicious blow -- we 
	hear BONE CRACK.  Neil falls back into the grave.

	The skeleton shrieks with unholy laughter and begins to shovel the 
	loose dirt onto Neil.

	It tosses the shovel aside, raises its arms into the air with a 
	victorious HOWL -- and collapses into a pile of bones.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - NIGHT

	Nancy, Kristen, Kincaid, and Joey exit the boiler room, limping, 
	battered, and bloody.  They face the weird perspectives of the Elm 
	Street halls.

						NANCY
			Kristen, can you pull us out?

						KRISTEN
			They sedated me.  We're stuck here till
			it wears off.

						NANCY
			Let's try this way.

	They start down a corridor and enter:

	INT. SEWING ROOM

	Eerie mannikins and an ornate three-way mirror stand in teh 
	shadows.

						KRISTEN
			It's a dead end.

	Suddenly, there's activity in the mirror.  A wavering light...then 
	Freddy materializes.  An infinity of Freddies are reflected in the 
	three-way mirror behind him.

						FREDDY
			Sorry to keep you waiting.  Perhaps if
			there were more of me to spread around.

	Freddy runs into the room, magically followed by rows of his 
	mirror reflections.

						KINCAID
			Holy shit!  He's multiplying!

	The room is suddenly filled with dozens of Freddies slashing and 
	chasing our heroes.

	NANCY

	leaps over a wicker basket to escape a Freddy.  As a second Freddy 
	lunges, she jams a knitting needle through its throat.

	KRISTEN

	springs over a group of Freddies, catches a wall fixture, and 
	flips across the room.

	KINCAID

	With a battle cry, he plows into the charging Freddies, bowling 
	them over.

	JOEY

	cringes back, cowering behind the mannikins.

	THE MIRROR

	More Freddies pouring into the room.

	NANCY

	is backed into a corner, torn with slash marks.

	KRISTEN

	delivering flying kicks, but slowing down.  A Freddy grabs her 
	from behind, holding her for the others.

	KINCAID

	goes down under the sheer weight of Freddies crawling all over 
	him, slashing.  There are jsut too many.

	JOEY

	steps out from behind teh mannikins, shaking with emotion as his 
	friends are overwhelmed -- none of them can last more that a few 
	seconds longer.  He opens his mouth and -- 

	CLOSEUP - JOEY

						JOEY
			NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

	An incridible, deafening, universe-shaking cry.  Joey has found 
	his dream power.

	THE THREE-WAY MIRROR

	is blown into fragments.

	VARIOUS ANGLES

	All the Freddies EXPLODING into shards of hurtling glass as nancy, 
	Kristen, and Kincaied cover their ears.

	JOEY

	finally stops.  Total silence.  He looks just as surprised as 
	everyone else at what he's done.

						JOEY
					(softly)
			Wow.
					(does a double take
					 at his own voice)
			Did I say that?

						KINCAID
			You sure as shit did!  You saved our
			asses!

						KRISTEN
			He's gone!  We got him!

	Kincaid scoops Joey into his arms in a crushing bear hug.

						JOEY
			Hey man, put me down!

										     CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNKYARD - NIGHT

	TIGHT ON the open grave.  A bloody, dirt-encrusted hand grasps the 
	edge of teh grave.  A second hand follows.  Neil Goldman slowly, 
	painfully pulls himself out of the grave.

	He has an ugly wound on the side of his head and his collarbone's 
	broken -- but he's alive.

	Gasping with pain, Neil crawls to the pile of Freddy's remains.  
	With tremendous effort, he pushes hte bones over the edge into the 
	grave.

	CLOSEUP - GRAVE

	The bones tumble into the earthen pit.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. SEWING ROOM - NIGHT

	Kristen helps Nancy to her feet as she brushes away the shattered 
	glass of the Freddies.

						KRISTEN
			Are you okay?

						NANCY
			I think so.

	They embrace tearfully.

						NANCY
					(softly)
			It's over.  It's over.

						THOMPSON (O.S.)
			Nancy...

	Nancy turns and sees her father floating toward her, glowing in a 
	golden nimbus of light.

						NANCY
			Daddy?

						THOMPSON (cont.)
			I've crossed over, Princess.

						NANCY
			Crossed over?

						THOMPSON
			But I couldn't go until I told you how
			sorry I am for all the things I've done.

	Nancy gazes at him, slowly comprehending.

						THOMPSON (cont.)
			I love you so much.  I'll always love
			you.  Goodbye, Princess.

	Nancy goes to embrace ehr father one final time.

						NANCY
			I'll always love you, Dadd --

	Her words are cut short as her body jerks violently.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - TIGHT

	"Thompson" is wearing Freddy's glove -- the razors buried in 
	Nancy's stomach.

	CLOSEUP - NANCY

	Her eyes wide and staring as she realizes.

						NANCY
					(weakly)
			No.

	CLOSEUP - FREDDY/THOMPSON

	As Thompson's face disappears and is replaced by Freddy's.

						FREDDY
			Die, bitch.

	He jams the blades in deeper.

										     CUT TO:

	EXT - JUNKYARD - NIGHT

	CLOSEUP ON Neil -- using his one good hand, he grasps the bottle 
	of holy water and uncorks it with his teeth.  He presses it to his 
	forehead and closes his eyes.

						NEIL
					(hoarse whisper)
			Please God.  For the children.  For
			Nancy.

	He looks down at Freddy's remains.

						NEIL (cont.)
			Ashes to ashes.

	He flicks a stream of holy water onto the bones.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. SEWING ROOM - NIGHT

	Freddy, still locked in an embrace with Nancy as she dies, SCREAMS 
	as a pattern of holes rip across his body -- bright shafts of 
	light burst through.

										     CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNKYARD - NIGHT

						NEIL
			Dust to dust.

	He flicks a second stream of water.

									           CUT TO:

	INT. SEWING ROOM - NIGHT

	Another arc of holes explode across Freddy's body.  He arches 
	back, SHRIEKING --

	-- and Nancy slides of his blades.  Kristen runs to her.

										     CUT TO:

	EXT - JUNKYARD - NIGHT

	Neil holds the crucifix.  He leans down and presses it against the 
	skull.

						NEIL
			Lay this spirit to rest.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. SEWING ROOM - CLOSEUP FREDDY

	A cross-shaped hole explodes from Freddy's forehead -- brilliant, 
	blinding white light pours out.

	WIDER

	As Freddy staggers back, riddled with glowing holes, we see a 
	whrilwind of spirit faces pouring from him -- sould of his victims 
	soaring out, freed at last.

	KINCAID AND JOEY

	Awestruck as they watch.

	FREDDY

	The holes expand, eating Freddy alive as his SCREAM ECHOES across 
	the dreamscape.

	The shafts of light from his body merge into one white hot ball -- 
	then EXPLODES.

	Freddy is gone.

	KRISTEN

	cradles Nancy in her arms.  nancy is drifting toward death.

						KRISTEN
					(crying)
			He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't
			die, Nancy.  Please.

						NANCY
					(weak)
			I'm so proud of you all.
					(pause)
			Tell Neil I...

	She sags against Kristen.  Kristen shakes her head, tears 
	brimming.

						KRISTEN
			I won't let you die.  i won't.
					(lower, strange intensity)
			I'm going to dream you...
					(whispering in Nancy's ear)
			I'm going to dream you into a beautiful
			dream.  Forever and ever.

	She closes her eyes and holds Nancy tight.

									 SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. CEMETERY - DUSK

	Three caskets are surrounded by a large number of MOURNERS.

	CLOSER

	Kristen, Joey, and Kincaid watch tearfully.  Neil, wearing a neck 
	brace, puts his arm around the kids as the caskets are lowered.

	CLOSEUP - NEIL

	He notices movement on the hilltop.

	NEIL'S POV

	The nun stands on the crest of the hill.  She turns and walks 
	away, disappearing from view.

	NEIL

	leaves the funeral and starts up the hillside after her.

	HILLTOP

	As neil reaches the tree where he first met the nun, he catches a 
	glimpse of her as she dissappears behind a crypt.

						NEIL
			Sister...wait.

	THE CRYPT

	Neil rounds the crypt -- the nun has vanished.

	Only a simple tombstone stands at this edge of the field.

	Neil steps closer.

	THE TOMBSTONE

	The inscription reads:

				Here Lies Amanda Krueger

				   Her name in Christ,
				   Sister Mary Helena.

				  Born 1907 - Died 1968

	CLOSEUP - NEIL

						NEIL
					(softly)
			My God.  You were his mother.

										DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. NEIL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	The seasons have changed.  A blanket of freshly fallen snow covers 
	the house.  A VW Rabbit with New York plates is parked in the 
	driveway.

	INT. NEIL'S HOUSE

	Kristen and Neil have finished a meal together and are sipping 
	wine.  Her hair is shorter.  Neil looks thinner, a little weary.

						NEIL
			I'm glad things have worked out for you.

						KRISTEN
			I think new York was just what I 
			needed.  So many people.  I never feel
			alone.

						NEIL
					(smiles)
			The city that never sleeps.
					(pause)
			So what will you do now?

						KRISTEN
			I don't know.  I'm busy with school.
			New friends.
					(beat)
			But I'll never forget the old ones.

						NEIL
					(raises his glass)
			To old friends.  And your new dreams.

						KRISTEN
			To old friends.

										     CUT TO:

	EXT. NEIL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Neil is at the door, seeing Kristen off.

						NEIL
			It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad
			you dropped by.

						KRISTEN
					(pauses at her car)
			Do you still...see each other?

						NEIL
					(strange little smile)
			Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight.

	Kristen nods.  She knew it.

						KRISTEN
			Will you say hi?
					(he smiles that he will)
			Good night.

	INT. HOUSE

	Neil closes the door.  He's alone in the empty house.  He turns 
	out the lights and trudges slowly upstairs.

										     CUT TO:

	INT. NEIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Neil in bed, drifting off to sleep.  The tight, weary look is gone 
	from his face -- he looks peaceful, contented.

	PAN TO the paper mache model of the Elm Street House.  It's 
	different now -- clean and pure and inviting.  A lovely little 
	place, in fact.

FADE IN

ON A RINGING TELEPHONE.

A hand reaches for it, bringing the receiver up to the face of CASEY 
BECKER, a young girl, no more than sixteen.  A friendly face with 
innocent eyes.

				CASEY
		Hello.

				MAN'S VOICE
			(from phone)
		Hello.

Silence.

				CASEY
		Yes.

				MAN
		Who is this?

				CASEY
		Who are you trying to reach?

				MAN
		What number is this?

				CASEY
		What number are you trying to reach?

				MAN
		I don't know.

				CASEY
		I think you have the wrong number.

				MAN
		Do I?

				CASEY
		It happens. Take it easy.

CLICK! She hangs up the phone.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Casey 
in a living room, alone.  She moves from the living room to the 
kitchen.  It's a nice house.  Affluent.

The phone RINGS again.

INT.  KITCHEN

Casey grabs the portable.

				CASEY
		Hello.

				MAN
		I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.

				CASEY
		So why did you dial it again?

				MAN
		To apologize.

				CASEY
		You're forgiven. Bye now.

				MAN
		Wait, wait, don't hang up.

Casey stands in front of a sliding glass door.  It's pitch black 
outside.

				CASEY
		What?

				MAN
		I want to talk to you for a second.

				CASEY
		They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya.

CLICK!  Casey hangs up.  A grin on her face.

EXT.  CASEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

A big country home with a huge sprawling lawn full of big oak trees.  
It sits alone with no neighbors in sight.

The phone RINGS again.

INT.  KITCHEN

Popcorn sizzles in a pot on the stove.  Casey covers it with a lid, 
reaching for the portable phone.

				CASEY
		Hello.

				MAN
		Why don't you want to talk to me?

				CASEY
		Who is this?

				MAN
		You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.

				CASEY
			(shaking the popcorn)
		I don't think so.

				MAN
		What's that noise?

Casey smiles, playing along, innocently.

				CASEY
		Popcorn.

				MAN
		You're making popcorn?

				CASEY
		Uh-huh.

				MAN
		I only eat popcorn at the movies.

				CASEY
		I'm getting ready to watch a video.

				MAN
		Really? What?

				CASEY
		Just some scary movie.

				MAN
		Do you like scary movies?

				CASEY
		Uh-huh.

				MAN
		What's your favorite scary movie?

He's flirting with her.  Casey moves away from the stove and takes a 
seat at the kitchen counter, directly in front of the glass door.

				CASEY
		I don't know.

				MAN
		You have to have a favorite.

Casey thinks for second.

				CASEY
		Uh...HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the 
		guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around
		and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?

				MAN
		Guess.

				CASEY
		Uh...NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.

				MAN
		Is that the one where the guy had knives 
		for fingers?

				CASEY
		Yeah...Freddy Krueger.

				MAN
		Freddy-that's right. I liked that movie.
		It was scary.

				CASEY
		The first one was, but the rest sucked.

				MAN
		So, you gotta boyfriend?

				CASEY
			(giggling)
		Why? You wanna ask me out?

				MAN
		Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?

				CASEY
		No.

				MAN
		You never told me your name.

Casey smiles, twirling her hair.

				CASEY
		Why do you want to know my name?

				MAN
		Because I want to know who I'm looking
		at.

Casey spins around like lightning facing the glass door.

				CASEY
		What did you say?

				MAN
		I want to now who I'm talking to.

				CASEY
		That's not what you said.

				MAN
		What do you think I said?

Casey CLICKS on the outside light.  A flood light illuminates the 
backyard.  Her eyes survey the grounds.  But it's empty.  No one's 
there.  She turns the light out.

On the stove, the popcorn POPS.

				CASEY
		I have to go now.

				MAN
		Wait...I thought we were gonna go out.

				CASEY
		Nah, I don't think so...

				MAN
		Don't hang up on me.

				CASEY
		Gotta go.

				MAN
		Don't...

CLICK!  Casey hangs up.  She checks the glass door making sure it's 
locked and then moves to the stove as...

THE PHONE RINGS.

She slides the popcorn from the stove, reaching for the phone.

				CASEY
		Yes?

				MAN
		I told you not to hang up on me.

				CASEY
		What do you want?

				MAN
		To talk.

				CASEY
		Dial someone else, okay?

				MAN
		You getting scared?

				CASEY
		No-bored.

CLICK.  She hangs up.  The phone RINGS again.  She grabs it.

				CASEY
		Listen, asshole...

				MAN
			(deadly serious)
		NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU
		HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE
		A FISH. UNDERSTAND?

Total silence.  He has gotten her full attention.

				CASEY
		Is this some kind of a joke?

				MAN
		More of a game, really.

Casey eyes the glass doors, then looks up the hallway to the front 
doors...moving to it.  It's unlocked.  She bolts it.

				CASEY
		I'm two seconds from calling the police.

				MAN
		They'd never make it in time.

Casey moves her face flush against the door, her eye looking through 
the peephole.

ANGLE THROUGH PEEPHOLE.

A distorted view of the front porch.  It is empty.  She relaxes a bit, 
relieved.

				CASEY
		What do you want?

				MAN
			(pure evil)
		TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.

Casey's jaw drops as total fear storms her face.  She hangs up the 
phone, throwing it down on a side table when...

THE DOORBELL CHIMES.

Casey leaps out of her skin.  She turns to the door as it chimes again.

				CASEY
			(calling out)
		Who's there?

Another CHIME.  She moves to it.

				CASEY
			(louder)
		Who's there?

No answer.  Fuck this.  It's time for the police.  She goes for the 
portable phone. Just as she picks it up...

IT RINGS.

Casey almost drops it, losing her breath...

She brings it to her ear with trembling hands, saying 
nothing...listening, waiting...

A long silence.  And then.

				MAN
		You should never say "Who's there?".
		Don't you watch scary movies? It's a
		death wish.

Casey clutches the wall, nearly collapsing.  She tries her damndest to 
hang tough.

				CASEY
		Look, enough is enough. You had your fun
		now you better leave me alone or else.

				MAN
		Or else what?

CLOSE ON her face, her mind thinking, calculating...

				CASEY
		My boyfriend will be here any second and
		he'll be pissed when I tell him...

				MAN
		I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.

Busted.  She holds steady.

				CASEY
		I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll 
		be here any second and your ass better
		be gone.

				MAN
		Sure...

				CASEY
		I swear it. And he's big and plays 
		football and will beat the shit out
		of you.

				MAN
		I'm getting scared.

				CASEY
		I'm telling you the truth.
		I lied before...

				MAN
		I believe you...

				CASEY
		So you better leave.

				MAN
		His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?

Silence.  Casey buckles at the knees, losing it.

				CASEY
		How do you know his name?

				MAN
		Go to the back door and turn on the porch 
		light--again.

Casey, terrified, forces herself to move.. staggering to the 
kitchen...to the glass doors.  Her shaky hand finds the light 
switch...she hits it.  The back yard is lit.

Sitting in a lawn chair in the middle of the backyard is a big, line 
backer of a guy, her boyfriend...

STEVE

tied and gagged.  He's been roughed up, but he's alive.
CLOSE ON his eyes..wide in fear..staring at his girlfriend, pleading 
with her.

				CASEY
		Oh Goddddd...

Casey SCREAMS.  Her hand moves to the lock on the door.

				MAN
		I wouldn't do that if I were you.

Terror rides Casey's face.  She's petrified.

				CASEY
		Where are you?

				MAN
		Guess.

Her eyes search the yard, combing bushes, trees.  He could be anywhere-
anywhere.

				CASEY
			(begging)
		Please don't hurt him.

				MAN
		That all depends on you.

				CASEY
		Why are you doing this?

Tears find their way, streaming down Casey's face.

				MAN
		I wanna play a game.

				CASEY
		No...

				MAN
		Then he dies. Right now.

				CASEY
		NOOO!

				MAN
		Which is it?

A long silence.  Casey touches the glass...staring at STEVE...this big 
jock of a guy is crying too.

				CASEY
		What kind of game?

				MAN
		Turn off the light.

Her hand goes to the switch...Steve tugs and pulls at his straps...as 
if begging her...his face sweat and tears...

CLICK

He disappears in the darkness.  Casey moves away from the glass, back 
toward the living room, unbelieving, horrified.

				MAN
		Here's how we play. I ask a question. If
		you get it right-Steve lives.

Three curtainless windows line one wall.  Casey crouches down behind 
the couch, tipping a lamp cord from it's socket, darkening the room.  
Her body quivers.

				CASEY
		Please don't do this...

				MAN
		Come on. It'll be fun.

				CASEY
		No...please.

				MAN
		It's an easy category. Movie trivia.

				CASEY
			(begging)
		..please...

				MAN
		I'll even give you a warm up question.

				CASEY
		Don't do this. I can't..

				MAN
		Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.

				CASEY
		No...

				MAN
		Come on. It's you favorite scary movie,
		remember? He had a white mask, he
		stalked the baby-sitters.

Casey goes silent...a nervous wreck...she can barely speak much less 
think.

				CASEY
		I don't know...

				MAN
		Come on, yes you do.

				CASEY
		Please..stop...

Casey is SOBBING.

				MAN
		What's his name?

				CASEY
		I can't think.

Casey has officially reached hysteria, petrified beyond all reality.

				MAN
		Steve's counting on you.

Suddenly...through tears...Godsent...

				CASEY
			(a whisper)
		Michael...Michael Myers.

				MAN
		YES!

Casey SIGHS...relieved.

				MAN
		Now for the real question.

				CASEY
		NOOOO....

				MAN
		But you're doing so well.

				CASEY
		Please go away! Leave us alone!

				MAN
		Then answer the question. Same category.

Casey is a blubbering, wet mass on the floor.

				CASEY
		..please..no...

				MAN
		Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.

A mad smile purses Casey's lips.  She knows this.  She leaps up, 
through tears, screaming...

				CASEY
		Jason! Jason!...JASON!

A slight PAUSE.

				MAN
		I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.

				CASEY
		No it's not. It was Jason.

				MAN
		Afraid not.

				CASEY
		It was Jason. I saw that godamned movie
		twenty times. It was Jason.

				MAN
		Then you should know Jason's MOTHER
		-Mrs.Vorhees was the original killer. Jason
		didn't show up until the sequel.

Casey is stupefied.

				CASEY
		You tricked me...

				MAN
		Lucky, for you there's a bonus round.
		But poor Steve...I'm afraid...he's out.

This implication sends Casey running to the kitchen...to the glass 
doors.  She flips on the porch lights to see...

STEVE

eyes wide, sitting in the lawn chair...his belly gaping open...a mass 
of blood and ripped flesh...his insides lay on the ground between his 
feet...steam rising.

A SCREAM erupts from the bottom of her soul as Casey collapse on the 
floor...nearly passing out.  CLOSE ON her face...pale and ghostly 
white.  She SOBS.

				MAN
		Final question. Are you ready?

She doesn't answer.  A long, maddening silence.  Casey reaches up and 
CLICKS off the light, making Steve go away...wishing, hoping...

				CASEY
		..leave me alone..please...

				MAN
		Answer the question and I will.

Casey is curled up on the floor like an infant, rocking slowly back and 
forth.

				MAN
		What door am I at?

				CASEY
		What?

				MAN
		There are two doors to your house. A
		front door and a back one. If you answer
		correctly-you live.

From where Casey sits she can see both front and back doors.  She 
deliberates...with her last bit of strength she tries to strategize.  
Eyeing both, the front door...the back door trying to decide between 
the two.

				CASEY
		Don't make me...I can't...I won't.

				MAN
		Your call.

In the darkness, Casey crawls to the kitchen counter-she leans up and 
grabs a long, sharp knife.

Casey looks around her...she looks down the hall to the front 
door...then turns back to the kitchen glass door as it suddenly...

SHATTERS TO BITS...

as a lawn chair come flying through it.  Exploding glass sprays 
everywhere.

This incites Casey like fire.  She springs to her feet...bolting out of 
the kitchen as a SHADOW moves quickly through the shattered doorframe.

ANGLE ON CASEY

Somewhere in the house, back flat against a window, listening to FEET 
ON CRACKING GLASS.  She turns and unlocks the latch, quietly sliding it 
up. She can hear him move through the foyer...to the front door.

Casey lifts herself up and puts her legs through the window.  She holds 
the knife in one hand, the phone in the other.

Casey eases out the window, fumbling, dropping the knife back in the 
house.  She starts to reach for it.  Fuck it, she takes off...

EXT.  SIDE OF HOUSE

Casey it at the back corner of the house.

				MAN
		I can hear you. I know you're here.

Casey eases along a narrow path between a tall fence and the side of 
the house...going for the front yard.  She must pass the three 
curtainless windows.  She gets to the first one and peeks in...

The FIGURE has pulled open the foyer closet, searching for her.

Casey creeps along, to the next window, she looks in...the FIGURE is 
completely on the other side of the room moving toward the hall that 
leads to other parts of the house.

She moves further along the house...squeezing by hedges...to the third 
window...she peeks in to the FIGURE...

STARING BACK AT HER...

His face covered with a ghostly white mask, inches from her...his eyes 
piercing through...soulless...Casey SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER as a hand...

CRASHES through the glass window grabbing hold of her neck...she beats 
at him trying to free herself...her nails dig into his arm...she 
wrenches from side to side...finally breaking free as the hands 
disappear inside the house...

EXT.  CORNER OF HOUSE

Casey sails around the corner of the house, eyeing the front door.  It 
remains closed.  Her eyes cover the sprawling country yard when 
suddenly....

HEADLIGHTS APPEAR

in the distance, coming down the road towards the house...she 
recognizes them instantly.  Mom...Dad...she tears off across the yard 
toward them...moving like lightning...

The car turns into the driveway...Casey SCREAMS, waving madly, rushing 
by a tree as...

THE GHOST MASKED FIGURE APPEARS

Casey stumbles back, catching her balance...the FIGURE moves on her, 
arm poised high...a flash of silver...and Casey is struck, across the 
chest.  She looks down to see her shirt blossoming red...a look of 
bewilderment as she drops to one knee.

The knife rises again...Casey throws her hand forward...the blade comes 
down...but it's blocked by the portable phone still in her hand.  She 
turns staggering to...

EXT.  DRIVEWAY

A MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE emerge from the parked car.  They move to the 
front door completely unaware of what's happening to their daughter, 
only feet from them.

EXT.  FRONT YARD

Casey stumbles forward...her parents ten feet away...she opens her 
mouth to scream but no sound resonates...she is beyond 
words...staggering, swaying...the FIGURE moving behind her.

EXT.  FRONT DOOR

Her parents approach the door

				FATHER
		That fish smelled strong.

				MOTHER
		I told you to send it back.

The father discovers the front door ajar.  A puzzled look.  Casey is 
right behind them with one arm outstretched.  If they'd only turn 
around...

They enter the house and close the door as....

Casey collapses on the ground, clutching her bloody chest...the FIGURE 
upon her.

INT.  FOYER

The father sees straight back into the kitchen...the shattered patio 
door.

				FATHER
		Jesus...

				MOTHER
		What is it? Where's Casey?

				FATHER
			(calling out)
		Casey? Casey?

In a split second they're both panic stricken.  The father begins 
searching the house frantically.  The mother is hysterical.

EXT.  FRONT YARD

CLOSE ON Casey...she's dragged by her feet through damp soil...the life 
going fast from her body...her hand still clutching the phone.

INT.  FOYER

Back in the house.

				MOTHER
		Where is she?

				FATHER
		Call the police.

The mother moves  to the phone in the foyer, picks it up...There is no 
dial tone.  She jiggles the base.

				FATHER
			(searching)
		Casey? Where are you honey? Call the
		police, goddammit.

				MOTHER
		The phone's dead.

The...the softest...faintest voice is heard...

				CASEY
			(from phone)
		..help me...

				MOTHER
		She's here, God, I can hear her.
		Where's my baby?

The husband returns to the foyer finding his wife clinging to the 
phone.

				FATHER
		Where is she?

				MOTHER
		I can hear her. Oh Mother of God,
		I can hear her.

The father upturns the living room.

				FATHER
		Casey! Casey!

				MOTHER
		Not my daughter...not my...

The husband grabs hold of his wife.

				FATHER
		Get in the car and drive down to 
		the Mackenzie's.

The other throws the front door open and rushes out...the father moves 
through the house when a SCREAM echoes out.  That of his wife.  He 
tears off for the front door.

EXT.  FRONT DOOR

The father rushes out the door to find his wife, on her knees, bent 
over, retching.  His eyes move beyond to a tree in the front yard...his 
stomach fails him...his dinner rises...as he bares witness to the 
single, most horrifying sight he'll ever see.

That of his only daughter as she hangs from a big oak tree...strung 
up...very much dead...her stomach ripped open.

BLACKOUT!

BEGIN MAIN TITLES

FADE IN:

INT.  BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT

A teenage girl's room.  Neat and pinkish.  On the bed, amongst age-old 
stuffed animals lie opened school books. The CAMERA PANS to a desk 
against the wall where...

SIDNEY PRESCOTT

a young girl of 17, sits, her face glued to the computer monitor in 
front of her.  CLOSE ON her face.  Sharp and clever with deep, lonely 
eyes.  She's comfortable in a plain, flannel nightgown.

Her hands are at work, typing feverishly, when suddenly...

CRASH-BOOM

A noise behind her.  She turns abruptly, eyeing an open window across 
the room. A SCRATCHING sound.  She stands and moves toward it.

EXT.  WINDOW

Sidney sticks her head out the window.  The late night wind hits her 
face as a SHADOW appears just to the left of her, a hand reaches out, 
grabs her and suddenly a FIGURE is on top of her...

INT.  BEDROOM

Sid SCREAMS...pulling away from the figure...breaking free, falling 
back onto the floor.

				VOICE
			(o.c.)
		Hey...it's just me.

Sid looks up to see...

BILLY LOOMIS

A young, strapping boy of seventeen.  Handsome and alluring.  A star 
quarterback/ class president type of guy.  He sports a smile that could 
last for days.

				SIDNEY
		Billy? What the...

				BILLY
		I'm sorry. Don't hate me.

				SIDNEY
		What are you doing here?

				BILLY
		You sleep in THAT?

Billy pulls himself through the window.

				SIDNEY
			(whispering)
		My dad's in the other room.

				BILLY
		I'll only stay a sec.

Suddenly...

The bedroom door BURSTS open.  The doorknob catches on the open closet 
door behind it jamming it, holding it in place.

				VOICE
			(from behind door)
		What's going on in there?

Billy quickly rolls out of sight behind the bed.  Sidney unjams the 
door to reveal...

MR. PRESCOTT, late 40's, a severe presence.  A distracted man, nervous 
and pre-occupied.

				MR. PRESCOTT
		Are you okay?

				SIDNEY
		Can you knock?

				MR. PRESCOTT
		I heard screaming.

				SIDNEY
		No you didn't.

				MR. PRESCOTT
		No? Oh, well...I'm hitting the sack. My
		flight leaves first thing in the morning.
		Now the expo runs all weekend so I 
		won't be back til Sunday. There's cash 
		on the table and I'll be staying at the
		Raleigh Hilton...

				SIDNEY
		..out at the airport...

				MR. PRESCOTT
		..so call if you need me.

				SIDNEY
		Got it.

He gives the bedroom a quick once over.

				MR. PRESCOTT
		I coulda swore I heard screaming.

Sidney distracts him, giving him a peck on the cheek.

				SIDNEY
		Have a good trip.

				MR. PRESCOTT
		Sleep tight, sweetie.

He gives her a wink and pulls the door closed.  Billy reappears.

				BILLY
		Close call.

				SIDNEY
		What are you doing here?

Billy takes a flying leap and lands on the bed.

				BILLY
		It just occurred to me that I've never
		snuck through your bedroom window.

				SIDNEY
		Now that it's out of your system.

				BILLY
		And I was home, bored, watching
		television, THE EXORCIST was on 
		and it got me thinking of you.

				SIDNEY
		Oh it did?

				BILLY
		Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good
		stuff was cut out and I started thinking
		about us and how two years ago, we started
		off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R"
		rating on our way to an NC17. And how
		things have changed and, lately, we're just
		sot of...edited for television.

				SIDNEY
		So you thought you could sneak in my
		window and we would  have little bump-
		bump.

				BILLY
		No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your 
		underwear rule. I just thought we might do
		some on top of the clothes stuff.

She snuggles up next to him, planting a kiss on his lips. Passionate 
and gentle.  He, however, reacts like a shark, moving on top of her, 
his hands everywhere as he presses into her...Sidney breaks away.

				SIDNEY
		Time to go, stud bucket.

Billy sits up.  His heart isn't racing...it's POUNDING.

				BILLY
		See what you do to me.

Sweat has popped out all over his forehead, his breathing heavy.

				SIDNEY
		You know what my dad will do to you?

				BILLY
		I'm going...I'm going.

He moves to the window.  She follows, motioning to his wound.

				SIDNEY
		I appreciate the romantic gesture.

She gives him a kiss goodnight.  Sweet and simple.

				BILLY
			(whisper)
		Hey..about the sex stuff. I'm not trying
		to rush you. I was only half serious.

She kisses him again as he eases through the window.

				SIDNEY
		Would you settle for a PG-13
		relationship?

				BILLY
		What's that?

She pulls her flannel gown open for a split second...flashing her left 
breast.  His mouth drops open...surprise, shock.  Their eyes meet.  
They share a smile.

				SIDNEY
		Get outa here.

INT.  SIDNEY'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

CLOSE on Sidney snuggling her pillow, sleeping peacefully when...

THE RADIO ALARM BLASTS from the night table loud enough to wake the 
dead.  Sidney bolts up.

				DISC JOCKEY
			(from radio)
		..found brutally murdered...

CLICK.  Sidney, quick with the reflexes, shuts it off instantly.  A car 
trunk SLAMS shut outside.

Sidney pulls herself out of bed and leans to the window just in time to 
see her Dad jumping in his car.  She half waves down at him but he 
doesn't see her.  He's as good as gone, pulling out of the driveway and 
disappearing down the road.

A moment as Sidney stands at the window, staring out after him.

EXT.  SCHOOL - MORNING

CLOSE ON A SIGN

"BAYBORO HIGH SCHOOL.  HOME OF THE FIGHTING BULLDOGS"

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a picture perfect small town school.  
Old and charming.  Students come and go, moving about.  Nothing 
unusual, except for the...

six police cars, four news vans, flashing cameras, and crowds and 
crowds of lookie-loo's gathered just off campus.

EXT.  SIDEWALK

Sidney approaches the school seeing the commotion.  Four different 
REPORTERS stand in front of four different cameras giving four 
different news reports.

She moves passed a policeman standing guard.  Her interest peaked, she 
stops at the first reporter who is...

GALE WEATHERS

Thirties.  He smart face is overshadowed by a flashy smile and a 
massive mane of chemically enhanced hair.

				GALE
			(for the camera)
		The small town of Bayboro, North Carolina
		was devastated last night when two young
		teenagers were found brutally butchered.
		Authorities have yet to issue a statement
		but our sources tell us that no arrest
		has been made and the murderer could 
		strike again...

ON SIDNEY.  Moved, disturbed.  From behind, a finger taps her shoulder.  
She spins around to see...

Tatum Riley, same age, feisty, carefree.

				TATUM
		Do you believe this shit?

				SIDNEY
		What happened?

They break away from the crowd and head for school.

				TATUM
		Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker
		and Steve Forrest were killed last night.

				SIDNEY
		No way.

				TATUM
		And not just killed, Sid. We're talking
		splatter movie killed-split open end to
		end.

				SIDNEY
		Casey Becker? She sits next to me in
		English.

				TATUM
		Not anymore. Her parents found her
		hanging from a tree. Her insides on the
		outside.

				SIDNEY
		Do they know who did it?

				TATUM
		Fucking clueless-they're interrogating
		the entire school. Teachers, students,
		staff, janitors...

				SIDNEY
		They think it's school-related?

				TATUM
		They don't know. Dewey said this is
		the worst crime they've ever seen. 
		Even worse than...
			(stopping herself)
		Well it's bad. They're bringing in the 
		feds. This is big.

Sidney looks back at Gale, her face deeply pained.

INT.  CLASSROOM - LATER

A frumpy old woman, MRS. TATE, faces her class.  Her hands clasped 
together.  A tragic look upon her face.

				MRS. TATE
		..a terrible tragedy. An unbearable
		loss. It's days like today we need 
		prayer in school...

Sidney sits near the rear of the room.  The desk in front of her sits 
vacant.  Sidney can't take her eyes of it.

The door opens and a student opens with a slip of paper.  He hand s it 
to Mrs. Tate.

				MRS. TATE
		Sidney. It appears to be your turn.

INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

The room is at capacity...wall to wall with police, and the likes.  
Some sit, stand, lean...

SHERIFF BURKE, a round man in his fifties, wipes the stress from his 
face.

				SHERIFF BURKE
		Who's up next?

A young officer looks at the clipboard.  This is DEPUTY RILEY, better 
known as DEWEY.  He's a big guy, 20's, handsome in a scrubbed-clean 
boyish way.

				DEWEY
		Sidney Prescott.

Sheriff Burke gestures to bring her in.  PRINCIPAL HIMBRY, 50's, an old 
codger of a man wearing a sour face speaks up.

				MR. HIMBRY
		Sidney Prescott. She was daughter of...

				DEWEY
		We all know Sidney, Mr. Himbry.

				SHERIFF BURKE
		How she doin'?

				MR. HIMBRY
		She's adjusted well. Maintains an "A"
		average. You never know she...

Himbry stops short, seeing Sidney in the doorway.  He rises and seats 
her.

				SHERIFF BURKE
		Hi Sidney.

				SIDNEY
		Sheriff Burke. Dewey.

Dewey shakes his head seriously.

				DEWEY
		It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.

				SHERIFF BURKE
		How is everything?

				SIDNEY
		Good.

				SHERIFF BURKE
		And your Dad? How's he doing?

				SIDNEY
		We're fine. Thanks.

				MR. HIMBRY
		We'll be brief, Sidney. The police have a
		few questions they'd like to ask you...

Sidney eyes them all nervously.

EXT.  SCHOOL COURTYARD - LATER

Students sit at outdoor tables eating lunch.  Crowded at one table is 
the "gang".  This consists of Sidney, Billy and Tatum.

Next to Tatum, sits her boyfriend STUART, with his arm draped across 
her back.  He's a Billy wannabe.  Almost the jock, almost handsome, 
almost cool.  He tries way to hard.

Across the table is the fifth wheel, RANDY.  A tall and gangly kid with 
no such Billy-like aspirations.  A witty jokester who elevates geek to 
coolness.

				TATUM
		Hunt? Why would they ask if you like
		to hunt?

				STU
		I don't know, they just did.

				RANDY
		Because their bodies were gutted.

Sidney flinches.

				BILLY
		Thanks Randy.

				TATUM
		They didn't ask me if I like to hunt.

				STU
		Because there's no way a girl could have
		killed them.

				TATUM
		That is so sexist. The killer could
		easily be female-BASIC INSTINCT.

				RANDY
		That was an ice pick-not exactly the
		same.

				STU
		Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely
		hollowed out. Takes a man to do
		something like that.

				TATUM
		Or a man's mentality.

				SIDNEY
			(quiet, almost to herself)
		How do you gut someone?

All eyes turn to Sidney.  A serious silence.  And then:

				STU
		You take a knife and slit from the groin
		to the sternum.

Sidney shivers down to her soul.  The whole table rolls their eyes at 
Stu.

				STU
		What? She asked.

				BILLY
		It's called tact, you fuckrag.

				STU
		Sorry.

				RANDY
		Remember in JAWS when they caught the 
		wrong shark at first and Richard Dreyfuss
		cut it open to look foe body parts and all
		they found was a licence plate and all this
		white milky goo.

Stu leans over and socks Randy in the arm.

				STU
		You heard Billy-shut the fuck up.

				SIDNEY
		Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?

Stu's taken back, a little off guard.

				STU
		For about two seconds.

				RANDY
		Before she dumped him foe Steve.

Tatum turns to Stu, surprised.

				TATUM
		I thought you dumped her for me.

				STU
		I did. He's full of shit.

				RANDY
		And are the police aware you dated the 
		victim?

				STU
			(offended)
		What are you saying? That I killed 
		her or something?

				RANDY
		It would certainly improve your high
		school Q.

				TATUM
		Stu was with me last night.

				RANDY
		Oooooh...before or after he sliced and
		diced.

				TATUM
		Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last
		night?

				RANDY
		Working, thank you.

				TATUM
		I thought Blockbuster fired you.

				RANDY
		Twice.

				STU
		I didn't kill anybody.

				BILLY
		No one's saying you did.

				RANDY
		Besides-
			(perfect Stu mimic)
		"Takes a man to do something like that."

				STU
		I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.

				RANDY
			(to Stu)
		Did you really put her liver in the
		mailbox? I hear they found her liver
		in the mailbox.

				TATUM
			(eyeing Sidney)
		Randy, you goon-fuck, I'm eating here.

Stu nibbles at Tatum's neck.

				STU
		Yeah, Randy, she's getting mad. I think
		you better liver alone.

Stu cracks up at his own joke.  The others just MOAN.  Sidney is about 
to crawl out of her skin, trying hard to ignore it all.

EXT.  SIDNEY'S HOUSE - LATER

A huge two story country home with a spacious lawn.

A yellow school bus stops in front of the house and Sidney steps off.

The house looks big and lonely as Sidney moves up the walk to the front 
door.

INT.  BEDROOM - LATER

Sidney is on the telephone.

				SIDNEY
			(into phone)
		You sure I can stay over?  My dad won't
		be back til Sunday.

				TATUM
			(through phone)
		No prob. I'll pick you up after
		practice.

				SIDNEY
		Tell your mom I said thanks.

				TATUM
		Yeah, yeah...are you okay?

				SIDNEY
		Uh-huh, it's just...you know, the police
		and reporters...it brings it all back.

				TATUM
		I'll be there by seven. I promise

				SIDNEY
		Thanks, Tatum.

				TATUM
		Later.

Sidney hangs up.  She takes a seat at her computer and boots it up.  
She sits in front of it staring at the blue screen...her own reflection 
staring back.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - LATER

Sidney comes down the stairs, her arms carrying a change of clothes, 
toothbrush, make-up...

She opens the hall closet and pulls a small overnight bag from the top 
shelf.  Moving into the living room she loads it up, plopping down on 
the sofa, hitting the TV remote.

CLOSE ON THE SCREEN

A news reporter fades in.

				REPORTER #1
			(on TV)
		The entire nation was shocked today by
		the teen murders in North Carolina...

Sidney switches channels.

				REPORTER #2
		The State Bureau of Investigation has
		joined forces with local authorities to
		help catch what the Governor has called
		the most heinous...

The channel switches again.  Gale weathers appears, standing in front 
of the school.  Her white teeth gleaming.

				GALE
		This is not the first time the small town
		of Bayboro has endured such tragedy. Only
		a year ago, Maureen Prescott, wife and 
		mother, was found raped and murdered...

An old black and white snapshot fills the screen-a woman, beautiful and 
familiar.

CLOSE ON SIDNEY

eyes frozen, mesmerized by the image.  Suddenly she CLICKS the TV off.  
Her eyes go to the clock on the end table.  5:45 PM.  Her eyes then 
move to the framed photo next to it...the same black and white photo 
stares at her...a healthy, vibrant woman.  An older version of Sidney.

Sidney curls up on the sofa closing her eyes tight...

INT.  LIVING ROOM - LATER

The clock on the end table reads 7:15 PM.  Sidney is fast asleep on the 
couch.  The phone RINGS.  Sidney leaps up grabbing the portable phone.

				TATUM
			(from phone)
		Practice ran late. I'm on my way.

				SIDNEY
			(eyes clock)
		It's past seven.

				TATUM
		Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite 
		it til way after ten.

				SIDNEY
		I'm not worried.

				TATUM
		Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER
		and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in
		ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you
		pause it just right you can see his penis.

				SIDNEY
		Whatever. Just hurry.

				TATUM
		Bye.

She hangs up the phone.  It immediately RINGS again.

				SIDNEY
			(into phone)
		Tatum?

				MAN'S VOICE
			(from phone)
		Hello, Sidney.

IT'S HIM.  THE VOICE FROM BEFORE.

				SIDNEY
		Hi. Who is this?

				MAN
		You tell me.

Sidney thinks, trying to place his voice.  It sounds a little 
distorted.

				SIDNEY
		I have no idea.

				MAN
		Scary night, isn't it? With the murders
		and all, it's like right out of a horror
		movie or something.

				SIDNEY
		Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are
		you calling from work? Tatum's on her
		way over.

				MAN
		Do you like scary movies, Sidney?

				SIDNEY
		I like that thing you're doing with your
		voice, Randy. It's sexy.

				MAN
		What's your favorite scary movie?

				SIDNEY
		Don't start. You know I don't watch that 
		shit.

				MAN
		And why is that?

				SIDNEY
			(playing along)
		Because they're all the same. It's
		always some stupid killer stalking some 
		big breasted girl-who can't act-who 
		always runs up the stairs when she should 
		be going out the front door. They're 
		ridiculous.

A brief silence.

				MAN
		Are you alone in the house?

				SIDNEY
		That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me,
		Randy.

				MAN
		Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.

				SIDNEY
		So who are you?

				MAN
		The question is not who am I. The
		question is where am I?

				SIDNEY
		So where are you?

				MAN
		Your front porch.

This gives her pause.  She moves to the window and pulls aside the 
drapes.

				SIDNEY
		Why would you call me from my
		front porch?

				MAN
		That's the original part.

ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW.  She can't quite see all of the porch.

				SIDNEY
		Oh yeah? Well I call your bluff.

Sidney goes to the front door.  She unlocks the bolt, unsnags the 
chain, and pulls the door open...revealing the front porch...

COMPLETELY EMPTY.

She steps out onto it, phone still in hand.  A single light shines 
overhead illuminating the porch, but little beyond.  Darkness is all 
around.

				SIDNEY
		So where are you?

				MAN
		Right here.

Sidney peers out into the darkness past thick shrubs that grow on 
either side of the porch.

				SIDNEY
		Can you see me right now?

				MAN
		Uh-huh.

				SIDNEY
		What am I doing?

She sticks her finger up her nose, pretending to pick.  Silence.  No 
answer.

				SIDNEY
		Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry.
		Bye now.

				MAN
		If you hang up, you'll die just like your 
		mother.

Sidney stops dead in her tracks, speechless.

				MAN
			(deadly)
		Do you want to die, Sidney? Your mother
		didn't.

His seriousness unnerves her.  Sid flies off the handle.

				SIDNEY
		FUCK YOU! YOU CRETIN!

She hangs up on him.  Moves back inside the house.  Locks, chains, and 
bolts the door when...

A FIGURE COMES LEAPING OUT OF THE HALL CLOSET

rushing her, ramming into her side..the phone flies..the FIGURE is on 
top of her as she goes down...SCREAMING...

She looks up to see the FIGURE, darkly dressed with a pale, distorted 
face, white and ghostly...a mask.

Her instincts surface and she kicks up with her foot making the contact 
with his leg...he topples over...coming right at her, his hand finding 
her neck.  Suddenly, along, silver blade appears above her.

Sidney pulls, jerks, twists...finally she lifts her torso forward 
knocking the FIGURE off her...sending him reeling into the living room.  
Wasting no time, Sidney leaps to her feet.

She moves to the front door, unlocks it...pulls it open...it catches on 
the chain.  Shit!  She pushes it closed again looking behind her..the 
FIGURE has risen, knife in hand.
Sidney pulls on the chain and then-inexplicably turns and...

RUNS UP THE STAIRS.  The FIGURE right behind her.

INT.  UPSTAIRS LANDING

The FIGURE leaps at Sidney taking hold of her foot, she grabs madly at 
the wall...her hands grasp a framed painting-a quiet country home, 
subdued colors, done in oils-she rips it from the wall swinging it 
behind her...

It catches the FIGURE head on, smashing against his skull, sending him 
backwards, tumbling down the stairs.  Sidney races to her bedroom...

INT.  BEDROOM

She locks the door shut, the pulls her closet door open, placing the 
edge right at the door knob just as...

THE FIGURE POUNDS AGAINST THE BEDROOM DOOR...

ramming it, it rips open, but the closet door catches it in a crazy 
vice-like hold.

Sidney grabs the desk phone.  It's dead...off the hook downstairs.

The figure rushes the door several times..the frame splinters..but 
won't give.

Sidney is at her computer, she punches at the keypad madly.

CLOSE ON SCREEN AS WORDS APPEAR.

		FAX MODEM

		9-1-1 SEND

The knife slashes through the crack in the door wildly.

ON SCREEN AGAIN

		HELP KILLER

		34 ELM ST

Sidney presses SEND when it occurs to her-all is quiet.  The FIGURE is 
gone.  A fearful silence.  She looks around...the only sound her own 
rapid, terrified BREATHING.

ON THE SCREEN

		"Stay calm.  Police enroute."

Suddenly a NOISE at the window...Sidney looks up to see...

BILLY

her boyfriend, staring at her, surprised.

				SIDNEY
		Oh Billy...Please...God...

				BILLY
		I heard screaming. The door was locked.
		Are you okay...

				SIDNEY
		He's here. He's trying to kill me...

Billy pulls himself through the window.  As he does, a small black 
object falls from his dark jeans.  It hits the floor as Sidney eyes 
it...a sleek, compact cellular phone.

Sidney stops in her tracks.  Their eyes meet...an eternity.  A SIREN is 
heard in the distance.  Sidney bolts...

				BILLY
		Hey...wait...what's goin..

Billy reaches for her.  Sidney unblocks the bedroom door and tears out 
of the room.

INT.  LANDING

Sidney nearly falls down the stairs...

INT.  FOYER

She rips the chain off the door, pulls it open, coming face to face 
with a white, ghostly mask.
A massive SCREAM erupts from her gut as...

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK

to find Dewey-Deputy Riley, holding it.  Red lights flash, sirens BLAST 
vas car after car surrounds the house.

Sidney falls into the safety of Dewey's arms.

EXT.  FRONT YARD - MINUTES LATER

The yard is a whirlwind of activity.  An ambulance, squad cars, cops 
everywhere...

CLOSE ON BILLY'S FACE

as it SMASHES against the hood of a police car.  His hands are being 
cuffed, his rights being read.

				BILLY
			(screaming)
		I didn't do anything! Sid...where's Sid?
		Ask her, she'll tell ya...

Dewey holds a car door open as Sheriff Burke steps out.

				DEWEY
		We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.

				SHERIFF BURKE
		Hank Loomis' kid? Aw..Jesus...

				DEWEY
		He's her boyfriend.

They approach Billy as he's being placed in a squad car.

				BILLY
		Sheriff...I didn't do it...please, call
		my Dad..please...

The squad car disappears with Billy as another car comes to a stop in 
front of the house.  Tatum gets out, freaked beyond belief.

Back to the Sheriff and Dewey as they storm across the yard.

				DEWEY
		I was first to respond.

				SHERIFF BURKE
		What were you doing out here?

				DEWEY
		Drive by patrol.

				SHERIFF BURKE
		How is she?

				DEWEY
		She's tough.

				SHERIFF BURKE
		Have to be. The shit she's gone through.

Across the yard sits Sidney, in the back of an ambulance as PARAMEDICS 
check her out.

Sheriff Burke and Riley approach.

				SHERIFF BURKE
		We're seeing a lot of you today.

She tries to smile but fails.

				DEWEY
		You gonna be able to come down to the
		station and talk to us a bit?

				SIDNEY
		..yeah...

TATUM appears, barreling past an OFFICER.

				TATUM
		What happened? Oh God...

Tatum rushes to her, grabbing hold of her.

				DEWEY
			(to Tatum)
		What are you doing here?

				TATUM
		Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.

				DEWEY
		You can't be here, Tatum. This is an
		official crime scene.

				SIDNEY
		It's okay. She was supposed to pick me 
		up.

				TATUM
		Her dad's out of town. She's staying
		with us.

				DEWEY
		Does mom know?

				TATUM
		Yes, you doofus.

Two news vans come driving up the street.

				SHERIFF BURKE
		The vultures are coming. Let's get you
		out of here.

EXT.  STREET

A big, white news van comes to a stop in front of the house.  The side 
door slides open and Gale Weathers hops out just in time to see Sidney 
being escorted to a squad car.

				GALE
		I'll be damned.

Jumping from the driver's seat is KENNY, Gale's cameraman and flunky.  
An earnest young chap on the chubby side.

				KENNY
		What? What?

				GALE
		Jesus! The camera-hurry!

But it's too late.  Sidney is as good as gone.  Gale sees Tatum moving 
quickly to her car.

				GALE
		Excuse me?

Tatum looks up to see Gale Weathers rushing her.

				GALE
		Was that Sidney Prescott they took away?

				TATUM
		I don't know.

Tatum hops in her car, ignoring her.

				GALE
		What happened to her?

				TATUM
		I'm not talking to you.

Tatum's car peels out as Kenny comes running up with his camera.

				KENNY
		Where'd she go?

Gale spins around, flashing her pearly whites.

				GALE
		Look, Kenny, I know you're about fifty
		pounds overweight but when I say hurry
		please interpret that as...MOVE YOUR
		FAT TUB OF LARD ASS NOW!

Gale moves back to the van leaving Kenny miffed.

INT.  POLICE STATION

A small town station.  The bull pen is a little square room with four 
desks and tonight--it's hopping.  Cops everywhere.

INT.  SHERIFF'S OFFICE

Sidney sits at a desk drinking a cup of water.  She wears the Sheriff's 
jacket over her shoulders.  Dewey approaches.

				SIDNEY
		Did you reach my Dad?

				DEWEY
		You're sure it was the Hilton?

				SIDNEY
		At the airport.

				DEWEY
		He's not registered. Could he have gone
		to another hotel?

				SIDNEY
		I don't know. I guess.

				DEWEY
		We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.

Sidney stares blankly, numb.

INT.  SHERIFF'S OFFICE

Billy sits opposite Sheriff Burke.  Next to Billy, sits his father, 
HANK LOOMIS, an older version of Billy.

				SHERIFF BURKE
		What are you doing with a cellular
		telephone, son?

				MR. LOOMIS
		It's my phone. He was just playing 
		around with it.

				SHERIFF BURKE
		You got some ideas of playing around, boy.

				BILLY
		I didn't call anyone with it. I just
		took it for fun.

				MR. LOOMIS
		Everybody's got one now. Why don't you
		check the phone bill for chrissakes.
		Call my carrier--AirFone Comp. They'll
		have records of every number dialed.

				SHERIFF BURKE
		Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were 
		you doing out at Sidney's tonight?

				BILLY
		I just wanted to see her, that's all.

				SHERIFF BURKE
		You rode your bike out there?

				BILLY
		Yes, sir.

				SHERIFF BURKE
		And last night? Sidney said you crawled
		through her window last night too?

				MR. LOOMIS
			(surprised)
		You were out last night?

				BILLY
		I watched TV for awhile but the I felt 
		like going for a bike ride.

				SHERIFF BURKE
		Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?

				BILLY
		No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone,
		Sheriff.

				SHERIFF BURKE
		We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The
		governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows
		who else on their way down here.

Billy fights tears.

				BILLY
		This is crazy. I didn't do it.

Sheriff Burke eyes him up and down, very carefully.

INT.  POLICE BULL PEN - MINUTES LATER

Tatum has joined Sidney.  The sheriff's door opens and Billy is led out 
by a coupla UNIFORMS.  Burke and Dewey appear in the door watching 
Tatum comfort Sidney.

OUT OF EAR SHOT

				DEWEY
		That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's
		and WalMart. Neither of which keep
		purchase records.

				SHERIFF BURKE
		What about the cellular phone bill?

				DEWEY
		They're pulling Loomis' account. But
		it'll be morning before we see something.
		You think he did it?

				SHERIFF BURKE
		Twenty years ago I woulda said not a
		chance. But these kids today...damn if I 
		know.

				TATUM
			(o.s.)
		Hey...Dewey. Can we go now?

				DEWEY
		Hold up a sec...

				SHERIFF BURKE
		She staying with you?

				DEWEY
		We haven't located her Dad yet.

				TATUM
			(o.s.)
		Goddammit, Dewey!

Dewey turns to her, his face red.

				DEWEY
		What did Mama tell you? When I wear this
		badge you treat me like a man of the law.

				TATUM
		I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're
		ready to go.

				SHERIFF BURKE
		Use the back way. Avoid the circus.

EXT.  POLICE STATION - SIDE DOOR

The door opens and Sidney, Tatum, Dewey, and a coupla OFFICERS exit 
avoiding the horde of REPORTERS that can be seen around the corner 
waiting anxiously at the front entrance.

				DEWEY
		I'll get the car. Wait here.

Dewey takes off.  From the darkness of the alley, Gale Weathers appears 
with Kenny and his camera.  They've been waiting.

				GALE
		Hello Sidney.

Sidney spins around to see Gale, standing, smiling at her.  Sidney's 
body tightens and her face goes taut.

				GALE
		Some night. Are you alright?

Their eyes meet in cold familiar stare.  Sidney says nothing.  She's 
visibly shaking.

				GALE
		What happened?

				TATUM
		She's not answering any questions. Just
		leave us alone, okay?

				SIDNEY
		It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her
		job. Right, GALE?

				GALE
		Yes, that's right.

Dewey, in a squad car, turns into the alley and pulls up.  The other 
news people have wisened up.  They begin to flock the alley.

				SIDNEY
		How's the book?

				GALE
		It'll be out later this year.

Sidney tries to contain herself..squeezing a clenched fist.

				SIDNEY
		I'll look for it.

				GALE
		I'll send you a copy.

In a blurred, unexpected instant, Sidney brings her fist forward, 
SMASHING it hard into Gale Weathers's face.  The impact sends Gale 
reeling backwards, knocking into Kenny as they both tumble to the 
pavement.

ON SIDNEY...breathing deep, a sense of satisfaction on her face.

INT.  TATUM'S BEDROOM - LATER

A spacious bedroom.  Typical.  Tatum and Sidney lay on the bed.  They 
both wear night shirts.

				TATUM
		God, I loved it. "I'll send you a copy."
		BAM! Bitch went down. "I'll send you a
		copy." BAM! Sid--SuperBitch!

Dewey appears in the doorway holding a bag of ice.

				DEWEY
		I thought you might want some ice for
		that right hook.

Sidney sits up, takes the ice, and puts it on her hand.

				DEWEY
		I'll be right next door. Try to get some
		sleep.

Dewey moves back out the door.

				SIDNEY
		Any word on my Dad?

				DEWEY
			(turning to her)
		Not yet, but we're looking. If you need
		anything...

				TATUM
		Yeah, yeah, yeah...

Dewey smiles, pulling the door closed on his way out.  Sidney lies back 
down.

				SIDNEY
		Just another sleepover at the Riley's.

				TATUM
		Just like old times, ain't it?

				SIDNEY
		No, nothing's like it used to be.

Sidney rolls over at her side, away from Tatum.

A telephone RINGS somewhere in the house.

				TATUM
		Do you really think Billy did it?

				SIDNEY
		He was there, Tatum.

				TATUM
		I knew this guy was too perfect. He was
		destined to have a flaw.

A KNOCK at the door.  It opens and a friendly, graying woman pops in.  
This is MAMA RILEY.  She wears a comforting smile.

				MAMA RILEY
		Telephone, dear.

				TATUM
		Who is it?

				MAMA RILEY
		It's for Sid

				SIDNEY
		My Dad?

Mama Riley shakes her head sadly.

				TATUM
		Take a message.

				SIDNEY
		It's alright. I'll get it.

Sidney takes off out the door.  Mama Riley motions to Tatum.

				MAMA RILEY
			(whispers)
		How is she?

Tatum shrugs.

INT.  HALLWAY

Sidney grabs the phone at the end of the hall.

				SIDNEY
		Hello?

				MAN
			(from phone)
		Hello Sidney.

IT'S HIM.  The CAMERA does a Hitchcock as Sidney's entire body goes 
weak..his VOICE moving through her..invading her.  She CRIES OUT.

				SIDNEY
		NOOOOOO...

Mama Riley turns in the doorway.  Tatum comes bolting out of the 
bedroom.

				MAN
			(from phone)
		Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy
		doesn't stand a chance with you.

				SIDNEY
		LEAVEMEALONE!

				MAN
		Looks like you fingered the wrong
		guy...again.

				SIDNEY
		Who are you?

				TATUM
		Hang up, Sid.

				MAN
		Don't worry. You'll find out soon
		enough. I promise.

Mama Riley BEATS on a closed bedroom door.

				MAMA RILEY
		Dewey! Dewey!

				MAN
		This is gonna be fun, Sidney. Just like
		old times.

CLICK.

Dewey flies out of his room wearing only his boxers...holding his gun.

				DEWEY
		What? What?

The phone goes dead.  Sidney stands frozen.

EXT.  BAYBORO MAIN STREET - DAWN - ESTABLISHING

The morning sun shines high over Bayboro Townsquare.  Cars come to 
life, townsfolk stir as the picture postcard community awakens from a 
restless sleep.

INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING

Sidney and Tatum sit at the kitchen table, dressed and ready for school 
as Mama Riley serves up breakfast.  A small television sits on the 
counter BLARING.

Dewey, in uniform, stands near the door, talking on the phone.

				MAMA RILEY
		I think you girls really should stay home
		today.

				TATUM
		Your objection is duly noted.

				SIDNEY
		I'd rather be around a lot of people,
		Mama Riley.

From the TV, Sidney hears her name, "SIDNEY PRESCOTT..."  All eyes go 
to the television.

				REPORTER
			(on TV)
		..who escaped a vicious attack last night
		was the daughter of Maureen Prescott who
		was brutally killed last year when
		convicted murderer Cotton Weary...

INSERT of COTTON WEARY, in prison fatigues.  A once handsome man, now 
haggard and worn.

				REPORTER
			(cont'd)
		..broke into their home and savagely
		raped and tortured the deceased. Cotton
		Weary is currently awaiting appeal for
		the death sentence handed down after the
		young Sidney testified against him. She
		was the key witness in the state's 
		prosecution...

				SIDNEY
		It's never gonna stop. Is it?

Dewey is off the phone.

				DEWEY
		Billy was released. His cellular bill
		was clean. He didn't make those calls.

				SIDNEY
		Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not
		making it up.

				DEWEY
		I know. We're checking every cellular 
		account in the county. Any calls made to
		you or Casey Becker are being cross-
		referenced. It's gonna take time but
		we'll find him.

				SIDNEY
		And my Dad? Any word on him?

Riley shakes his head "no".

EXT.  SCHOOL STREET - LATER

Once again, REPORTERS line the street attacking students as they make 
their way to school, asking questions, hungry for that teenage insight.

Dewey's patrol jeep cruises by.  Sidney watches from the passenger's 
window.

INT.  PATROL CAR

Dewey pulls up in front of the school.  Tatum hops out while Sid 
lingers, suddenly unsure.  Dewey takes notice.

				DEWEY
		Hey, it's school. You'll be safe here.

Sidney forces herself out of the jeep as a microphone is shoved in her 
face...

				REPORTER
		How does it feel to almost be brutally 
		murdered?

Dewey leaps from the car, intercepting the reporter.

				DEWEY
		Leave the girl alone, will ya? She wants
		to go to school.

Sidney eyes the newsvan that's pulled up behind her.  The side door 
slides open and Gale Weathers steps out.

				TATUM
		Come on, Sid.

				SIDNEY
		Just a sec...I need to talk to someone.

She heads over to Gale.

EXT.  NEWSVAN - STREET

Sidney, puts her head down, hiding her face...avoiding other reporters 
as she makes her way to...

Gale who sits in the open door, checking her face in a mirror.  Makeup 
tries hard to hide Sid's handwork-a swollen black and blue right cheek.

Gale spots Sidney immediately and leaps to her feet.

				GALE
		Stop right there.

Sidney throws her hands up in surrender.

				SIDNEY
		I'm not here to fight.

				GALE
		Just stay back.

				SIDNEY
		I want to talk to you.

				GALE
			(calling into the van)
		Kenny. Camera. Now.

Kenny's head darts out from the van.

				SIDNEY
		Off the record. No cameras.

				GALE
		Forget it.

Sidney contains herself.

				SIDNEY
		Please. You owe me.

				GALE
		I owe you shit.

Gale moves inside the van.  But Sidney is relentless.

				SIDNEY
		You owe my mother.

				GALE
		Your mother's murder was last year's
		hottest court case. Somebody was gonna 
		write a book about it.

				SIDNEY
		And it had to be you with all your lies
		and bullshit theories.

				GALE
		What is your problem? You got what you
		wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail.
		They're gonna gas him. A book is not
		gonna change that.

				SIDNEY
		Do you still think he's innocent?

Gale's interest is peaked.  She eyes Sidney suspiciously.

				GALE
		He was convicted in a court of law. Your
		testimony put him away. It doesn't 
		matter what I think.

				SIDNEY
		During the trial, you did all those 
		stories about me. You called me a liar.

				GALE
		I think you falsely identified him. Yes.

				SIDNEY
		Have you talked to Cotton?

				GALE
		Many times.

				SIDNEY
		Has his story changed?

				GALE
		Not one word. He admits to having sex
		with your mother but that's all.

				SIDNEY
		He's lying. She wouldn't have touched
		him. He raped her, then butchered her.
		Her blood was all over his coat.

				GALE
		He was drunk that night. He left his
		coat at your house, after your mother
		seduced him...

				SIDNEY
		I saw him leaving wearing it.

				GALE
		But couldn't it have been someone else
		you saw wearing that coat? The same
		person who planted it in Cotton's car,
		framing him? The same person who 
		really killed your mother?

A long beat.  Sidney considers this for the millionth time.

				SIDNEY
		No, Cotton murdered my mother.

But there's doubt in her voice.  Gale's face lights up.

				GALE
		You're not so sure anymore, are you?

Sidney clams up.

				SIDNEY
		No, it was Cotton.

Tatum comes waltzing up.

				TATUM
			(to GALE)
		Nice welt.

Gale ignores her, zeroing in on Sidney, half realizing.

				GALE
		The killer is still on the loose, isn't 
		he? These murders are related.

				TATUM
		Yo--let's rock.

Sidney starts to fidget.

				SIDNEY
		I'm sorry I mangled your face.

She take off with Tatum.  Gale calls after her.

				GALE
		Wait, Sidney, don't go...

But Sidney and Tatum have already disappeared in the crowd of students 
moving across campus.

Gale looks to Kenny.

				GALE
		Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death
		row. A killer still on the loose.
		Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.

				KENNY
		You want to go live?

Gale's mind races with possibilities.

				GALE
		No, not so fast. We have nothing
		concrete.

				KENNY
		When did that ever stop you? You can't
		sit on this. This is huge.

				GALE
		If I'm gonna blow this up-I need hard
		proof.

				KENNY
		But it's so much easier when we make it
		up.

				GALE
		Not this time. I owe Cotton that much.
		Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.

EXT.  SCHOOL CAMPUS - SECONDS LATER

Tatum and Sidney make their way across campus.

				TATUM
		Just relax. You're at school now. No
		one can get you here.

				SIDNEY
		But if it wasn't Billy it could be
		anybody. He could be here at school
		right now.

They move up the walk as a FIGURE falls in step behind them, sporting a 
WHITE GHOST MASK.

				TATUM
		Serial killers are smart by definition.
		They minimize their risk. They plan and
		pre-calculate everything. Showing up
		here would be the most lame-brain
		move he could make.

				SIDNEY
		He promised me he'd be back.

As easy as the figure appeared, it disappears-falling out of site, 
unseen by either of them.

				TATUM
		I wouldn't put too much stock in a
		psycho's promise.

They move up the front steps toward the main doors of the school as the 
GHOST MASKED FIGURE reappears...standing at the top of the 
steps...Sidney sees it first, stopping dead in her tracks.

She steps back, spinning around to find...

A GHOST FACE behind her as well, both of them approaching, closing in 
on her.  Sidney starts to SCREAM when the two ghosts bust up LAUGHING, 
tearing off across campus.

EXT.  STREET

In front of the school we catch up a REPORTER doing a live remote.  He 
holds a mask in his hand.

				REPORTER
		This morning several students, in what
		appears to be a prank, have been spotted
		wearing masks. School officials have yet
		to comment but this is the same type of
		mask worn by the killer...

INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

Just before the bell.  The hallway is congested with students heading 
to class.  Tatum is at her locker with Sidney.

				SIDNEY
		This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.

				TATUM
		I want you to meet me here right after
		class, okay?

Billy appears in the crowd, with Stu tagging behind.  Tatum spots him 
first.

				TATUM
		Shit, what is he doing here?

				SIDNEY
		I bet he's pissed.

				TATUM
		Just ignore him. You had good reason to 
		think what you did.

Billy and Stu approach.  Billy's face is solemn.

				BILLY
		Hi, Sid. Can we talk a sec?

Sidney says nothing.  She can barely look at him.  Tatum intervenes.

				TATUM
		You know if I were accused of carving up
		two people, I'd take the opportunity to
		skip school.

				STU
		Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.

				BILLY
		Talk to me, Sid.

Suddenly, a SCREAM erupts.  All eyes go to a GHOST MASKED STUDENT 
running down the hall, screaming wildly, running amuck.

				SIDNEY
		Why are they doing this?

				STU
		Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.

Billy punches Stu in the side.

				STU
		Owwww...

				BILLY
		You open your mouth and stupidity pours
		out.

				STU
		Sorry.

Sidney, clearly upset, takes off down the hall.  Billy races off after 
her.

				TATUM
			(yelling)
		Stay away from her, Billy.

Tatum SLAMS her locker door shut as the bell RINGS.

INT.  CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER

With first period underway, the halls have cleared.  One or two 
struggling students can be seen rushing to class.

Sidney moves quickly down the hall, rounding a corner, running smack 
into...

BILLY

They collide hard catching Sidney off guard, scaring the life out of 
her.  She falls backwards, but Billy catches her fall.

				SIDNEY
		Jesus, SHIT!

				BILLY
		Hey, hey, it's just me.

Sidney pulls away from him quickly.  Billy feels the slight.

				BILLY
		What? You don't still think it's me?

Sidney catches her breath.

				SIDNEY
		No...I don't...it's just...Oh God, Billy,
		someone was there, someone tried to 
		kill me.

				BILLY
		The police say I scared him off. It
		wasn't me, Sid.

				SIDNEY
		I know. He called again last night at
		Tatum's house.

				BILLY
		See, it couldn't have been me. I was in
		jail, remember?

				SIDNEY
		I'm so sorry...please understand.

				BILLY
		Understand what? That I got a girlfriend
		who would rather accuse me of being a 
		psychopathic killer than touch me.

				SIDNEY
		You know that's not true.

				BILLY
		Then what is it? Is there somebody else?

				SIDNEY
		No...

				BILLY
		Is it the sex thing? Am I being too
		pushy?

				SIDNEY
		No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm
		still adjusting to my mom.

				BILLY
		It's been a year since she died.

				SIDNEY
			(correcting him)
		Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.

				BILLY
		When are you gonna let that go, Sid?
		When my mom left my dad--I just accepted
		it. This is the way it is. She's not coming
		back.

				SIDNEY
			(sharply)
		Your parents split up. It's not the same
		thing. Your mom left town, she's not in
		a coffin somewhere.

				BILLY
		You have to move on, Sid.

Sidney starts to walk away but turns back, angry.

				SIDNEY
		I'm glad to know you're coping so well
		with life, Billy. But some of us aren't so
		perfect. Some of us are just trying to
		hold on.

Sidney disappears through a door marked GIRL'S BATHROOM, leaving Billy 
alone in the hallway.  He SMACKS his forehead, pissed at himself.

INT.  GIRL'S BATHROOM

Large and spacious.  Closed bathroom stalls line one wall facing a row 
of sinks and a huge mirror.  Sidney enters as TWO GIRLS tinkle and 
talk--each from their respective stalls.

				GIRL #1
		She was never attacked. I think she made
		it all up.

				GIRL #2
		Why would she lie about it?

				GIRL #1
		For attention. The girl has some serious 
		issues.

Sidney listens intently.

A toilet FLUSHES.  Sidney quickly jumps in a stall, hiding, just as 
GIRL #1 appears from a stall.  She looks like that voice--a snotty 
little twit.

				GIRL #1
		What if she did it? What if Sidney
		killed Casey and Steve?

				GIRL #2
		And why would she do that?

				GIRL #1
		Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed
		them both in a jealous rage.

Another toilet FLUSHES.

				GIRL #2
		Why would Sidney want to be with Steve?
		She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.

				GIRL #1
		Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.

INSIDE THE STALL Sidney listens.  Her face weakening.

				GIRL #2
		You're evil.

				GIRL #1
		Please, it's common knowledge. Her
		mother was a trollop.

GIRL #2 appears from her stall--another twit.  They both stand in front 
of the mirror adjusting two snotty faces.

				GIRL #2
		Cut some slack. She watched her mom get
		butchered.

				GIRL #1
		And it fucked her up royally. Think
		about it. It makes perfect sense. Her
		mom's death leaves her distraught and
		hostile at a cruel and inhumane world,
		she's disillusioned, where's God, etc.
		Completely suicidal. And one day she
		snaps. She wants to kill herself but
		realizes teen suicide is out this year.
		And homicide is a much healthier
		therapeutic expression.

From the stall, Sidney listens, her heart pounding, jaw quivering.

				GIRL #2
		Where do you get this shit?

				GIRL #1
		Ricki Lake.

The two girls exit.  Sidney moves out of the stall, catching her 
reflection in the mirror.

				SIDNEY
		Pathetic.

Water DRIPS somewhere from a leaky pipe as wind WHISTLES in from the 
cracked transom above the bathroom door.  It sound almost like a 
whisper,   "Siddneey..."

Sidney spins around.  What the...  She checks out the bathroom.  The 
doors to the stalls are all closed.  She bends down and scans beneath 
them, looking for feet.  No one.  Nothing.

Sidney turns back to the mirror.  Suddenly...

				MAN
			(o.c. whisper)
		Siddneey...

Unmistakable this time.  The VOICE strikes Sidney like a nail through 
the eye.  It comes from one of the stalls.  She stands thunderstruck, 
eyeing the stalls thru the mirror.

				SIDNEY
		Is someone there?

A long, morose silence.  And then:

				MAN
			(softly, simply)
		It's me, Sidney.

Sidney spins around.  Fuck no!  HE'S HERE.  Terror floods her face.  
She eyes the exit door, then the row of stalls she must pass to get to 
it.

She checks under the stalls again.  Nothing...where the fuck is he?  
She takes a step forward when...

TWO FEET step down from a toilet onto the floor in the last stall.  
Sidney's face draws tight as the stall door begins to CREAK open.  She 
bolts forward, making a break for it...but slips on the wet floor...her 
feet flying out from under...

Sidney reaches out...grabs hold of a sink...saves herself from 
falling...she glimpses a GHOST MASK in the mirror coming for her.  A 
hand grabs her shoulder as she SLAMS her body through the exit 
door...narrowly escaping.

INT.  CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Sidney flies out of the bathroom door SCREAMING...burning up the 
hallway, not looking back.  A TEACHER, hearing her SCREAM, peer out 
from an open doorway...as Sidney sprints by him, not stopping...running 
madly.

INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE on a red-faced Principal Himbry as he reads someone the riot act.

MR. HIMBRY
I'm sickened. Your whole havoc-inducing,
thieving, whoring generation disgusts me.

The CAMERA SWINGS AROUND to reveal two GHOST MASKED STUDENTS standing 
at attention.  Mr. Himbry rips the mask off of one of the student's 
heads.

				MR. HIMBRY
		Two students have been savagely murdered.
		And this is how we express our compassion
		and sensivity?

He rips the mask off the other student.

				MR. HIMBRY
		We throw on a mask and dance around
		campus just hoping someone else gets
		butchered before we get bored again.
		You're both expelled.

The GHOSTS doth protest...

				GHOST #1
		Aw, come on, Mr. Himbry, it was just a
		joke.

				GHOST #2
		Yeah, that's not fair.

A deep rooted hostility has taken over Mr. Himbry's face.  Neither 
student budges, scared to even breathe.

				MR. HIMBRY
		No, it's not fair. Fairness would be to
		rip your insides out and hang you from 
		a tree so you can be exposed for the
		desensitized, heartless little shits that
		you are.

Suddenly the door BURSTS open and Sidney appears, hysterical.

				SIDNEY
			(crying)
		He's here...I saw him...he's here...

Mr. Himbry rushes to her, arms outstretched.

				MR. HIMBRY
		Easy child.

Sidney collapses in his arms.

EXT.  SCHOOL STREET - MINUTES LATER

Dewey's patrol jeep is parked in front of the school.  He stands in the 
open driver's door talking on the radio.

				SHERIFF BURKE
			(from radio)
		She's okay. Looks like some boys were
		teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the
		school though. I want you to take look 
		around.

				DEWEY
		Yes, sir, sheriff.

Dewey shuts the jeep door and heads for campus when Gale Weathers 
appears, her fake face aglow.

				GALE
		Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent,
		INSIDE STORY.

				DEWEY
		I know who you are, ma'am. How's the
		eye?

				GALE
		Productive. So they're closing down the
		school?

				DEWEY
		Well..uh...yes ma'am. For the time being.

Dewey heads for the school building. Gale scurries along side him 
flirtatiously.

				GALE
		And why is that? Has something happened?

				DEWEY
		You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.

				GALE
		I know, I should be in New York covering
		the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew?
		Please, call me Gale. You look awfully
		young to be a police officer.

Dewey's eyes wander down to Gale's long legs, the way her hips move as 
she walks...he's clearly distracted.

				DEWEY
		I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.

				GALE
		Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study
		I proved to be most popular amongst
		males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course,
		you don't look a day over twelve, except 
		in the upper torso area. Does the force
		require that you work out?

Dewey looks away, blushing a bit.

				DEWEY
		No, ma'am. Because of my boyish good
		looks, muscle mass has increased my
		acceptance as a serious police officer.

They approach the school's front entrance.  Suddenly, Mr. Himbry's 
VOICE in amplified through intercoms across campus via the PA system.  
They stop to listen.

				MR. HIMBRY
			(via PA)
		"Your attention please. Due to the
		recent events that have occurred and
		until it comes to a resolve--effective
		immediately--all classes are suspended
		til further notice. The Bayboro Police
		Dept. has also asked me to announce a
		city wide curfew beginning at 6 o'clock
		PM. I repeat..."

Gale speaks over Mr. Himbry's voice.

				GALE
		Boy, you people sure do make fuss over
		a serial killer.

				DEWEY
		Serial killer is not really accurate,
		ma'am. The killer has yet to strike 
		twice.

				GALE
		Well, we can hope, can't we? We
		certainly don't have any leads. A ghost
		mask, a cellular phone--not much there.

				DEWEY
		We're tracking the cellular phone bill.

				GALE
		Really? You small town guys are good.
		And have you located Sidney's father?

				DEWEY
		No, not yet.

				GALE
		He's not a suspect, is he?

				DEWEY
		We haven't ruled out that possibil...

Dewey, realizing he's said too much, clams up.

				DEWEY
		If you'll excuse me, ma'am.

				GALE
		Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.

				DEWEY
		That's quite alright. If I may say so,
		ma'am, you're much prettier in person.

Dewey starts up the school's front steps as the bell RINGS.

				GALE
		So you do watch the show?

He turns to her earnestly as STUDENTS come pouring out the front doors.

				DEWEY
		I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole
		year.

				GALE
		You are precious. Please, call me Gale.

She smiles deliciously, gives him a wink, then struts off as Dewey, 
like a nervous little school boy watches her go.

INT.  SCHOOL CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER

School is clearing out.  The halls have begun to empty as Tatum escorts 
Sidney down the hallway.

				TATUM
		It was just some sick fuck having a
		laugh.

				SIDNEY
		It was him, Tatum. I know it.

Tatum wants to believe her but...

				TATUM
		You are not to be alone again. Is that
		clear? If you pee--I pee.

Stu appears.

				STU
		Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid,
		what happened?

				TATUM
		For once, Stu, drop it.

				STU
		Okay, but whatever you did--the entire
		student body thanks you.

Stu moves to Tatum and gives her a kiss.

				STU
		And to celebrate this impromptu fall
		break, I propose we have a party.
		Tonight, my house.

				SIDNEY
		Are you serious?

				STU
		My parents are out of town. It'll be
		like my hurricane bash last year.
		Nothing extreme. Just a few of us,
		hangin'.

Tatum warms to the idea.

				TATUM
		This could be good. What do you think,
		Sid?

				SIDNEY
		I don't know...

				TATUM
		Come on. Pathos has it's perks.

Sidney considers trying hard to be good spirited.

				STU
		Remember, there's safety in numbers.

				SIDNEY
			(giving in)
		Yeah, okay...whatever.

				STU
		Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.

Stu speeds off, sliding down the empty hallway.

INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - LATER

Mr. Himbry sits at his desk staring at the ghosts masks before him.  He 
picks one of them up, snickering.

				MR. HIMBRY
		Damn...

He stands and moves to the closet next to his office door.  He pulls it 
open to reveal a mirror hooked inside the door.  He tries the mask on, 
pulling it over his face, looking in the mirror when...

A KNOCK AT THE DOOR stops him.  He rips the mask off his head, turns to 
his office door and opens it to reveal...

AN EMPTY DOORWAY.  He pokes his head into the outer office area and 
looks around.  But no one's there.

				MR. HIMBRY
		Yes? Hello?

The place is empty.  A little suspicious he closes the door, catching 
his reflection in the closet mirror.  He looks at the mask in his 
hands.  Jesus, even he's jumpy.  Two seconds later...

ANOTHER KNOCK AT THE DOOR.  Himbry grabs the door quickly, this time 
throwing it open.  Again no one's there.  He steps out into the outer 
office determined to catch a prankster.

INT.  OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Completely empty.  Mr. Himbry moves through the outer office and into 
the school corridor.  The overhead lights have been turned off and the 
corridor is now dark and deserted.  He looks up and down the hall.  
Only a JANITOR is seen in the distance pushing a broom.

				MR. HIMBRY
		Little shits.

Mr. Himbry returns to his office.

INT.  OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Himbry reenters his office, moving to his desk, when he spots the 
closet door NOW CLOSED SHUT.

This gives him a pause-he had left it open.  Hadn't he?  Suddenly, he 
can't remember.  He shifts uneasy, reaching for the door knob, pulling 
the door open to reveal...

AN EMPTY CLOSET.  He stands still a moment, suddenly realizing someone 
could easily now be standing behind the open closet door.  Nervously, 
he pushes it shut to reveal...

NOTHING.  Himbry shakes away his jitters, realizing he's spooked 
himself.  He continues to his desk, pushing his office door shut 
when...

A GHOST MASKED FIGURE lunges from behind it...knife in hand.  Quick and 
easy.  Three quick jabs to the stomach and Himbry goes down.  The GHOST 
MASKED FIGURE towering above him.

EXT.  TATUM'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON - LATER

The late afternoon sun is quickly disappearing.

Tatum and Sidney rock on the front porch looking out into the small 
town neighborhood.  Dewey's patrol jeep is parked in the driveway.

Despite loud music, BLARING from an inside stereo, this is a quiet  
moment.

				TATUM
		Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth.
		Maybe he was having an affair with your
		mom.

				SIDNEY
		So you think my mom was a slut too?

				TATUM
		I didn't say that, Sid. But you know
		there were rumors. Your dad was 
		always out of town on business. 
		Maybe your mom was a very unhappy
		woman.

				SIDNEY
		If they were having an affair how come
		that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?

				TATUM
		You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's 
		a rumor.

				SIDNEY
		Created by that little tabloid twit Gale
		Weathers.

				TATUM
			(delicately)
		It goes further back, Sid. There's been
		talk about other men.

				SIDNEY
		And you believe it?

				TATUM
		Well...you can only hear that Richard
		Gere-gerbil story so many times before
you have to start believing it.

A long silence as Sidney agonizes over all of this.  She stands up and 
moves to the edge of the porch and stares out onto the neighborhood.

				SIDNEY
		If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still
		out there.

				TATUM
		Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to
		sound like some Wes Carpenter flick.
		Don't freak yourself out--we've got a
		long night ahead of us.

				SIDNEY
		You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore
		me.

				TATUM
		Come on, let's rock.

Sid follows Tatum inside the house never seeing the GHOST MASKED FIGURE 
that stands across the street, under a tree.  His presence so subtle 
and unobtrusive you'd have to see this movie a second time to know he 
was there all along.

EXT.  MAIN STREET - LATER

Stu is moving along main street when Billy comes barreling up next to 
him.

				BILLY
		How'd you do?

				STU
		Piece of cake. She'll be there.

				BILLY
		Thanks, butt wart. You did good.

				STU
		So you gonna try and make up with Sid?

				BILLY
		Duh...that's quick.

				STU
		I was just asking. Why are you always at
		me?

				BILLY
		Because I'm trying to build your self-
		esteem. You're far too sensitive.

				STU
		Oh....

Billy thumbs Stu's forehead.

				BILLY
		You ready to party hard tonight?

				STU
		You know it.

They come to a building centrally located in the heart of Main Street.  
A huge, blue monstrosity that's bigger than the local bank and post 
office combined. The sign in front reads BLOCKBUSTER.

INT.  BLOCKBUSTER - CONTINUOUS

You typical Blockbuster--huge and crowded.  Randy, in his Blockbuster 
get up, is busy reshelving returns when Stu appears--knocking the 
videos out of his hand.

				STU
		Jesus, this place is packed.

				RANDY
			(picking up videos)
		We had a run in the mass murder section.

				STU
		You coming tonight?

				RANDY
		Yeah, I'm off early--curfew you know.
			(looking off)
		Now that's poor taste.

				STU
		What?

Randy refers to Billy who stands down the aisle talking to TWO GIRLS.  
(The twits from the bathroom perhaps.)

				RANDY
		If you were the only suspect in a
		senseless bloodbath would you be standing
		in the horror section?

				STU
		It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't
		do anything.

				RANDY
		You're such a little lap dog. He's got
		killer printed all over his forehead.

				STU
		The why'd the police let him go?

				RANDY
		Because, obviously they don't watch 
		enough movies. This is standard horror
		movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.

Randy moves down the aisle, reshelving videos.

				STU
		Why would he want to kill his own 
		girlfriend?

				RANDY
		There's always some stupid bullshit
		reason to kill your girlfriend. That's
		the beauty of it all. Simplicity.
		Besides, if it's too complicated you lose
		your target audience.

				STU
		So what's his reason?

				RANDY
		Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.

				STU
		She's saving herself for you.

				RANDY
		Could be. Now that Billy's tried to
		mutilate her, you think Sid would go out
		with me?

				STU
		I think her father did it. How come they
		can't find his ass?

				RANDY
		Because he's probably dead. His body
		will come popping out in the last reel
		somewhere...eyes gauged. See, the police
		are always off track with this shit, if they'd 
		watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time.
		There's formula to it. A very simple one.
		Everyone's always a suspect--the father,
		the principal, the town derelict...

				STU
		Which is you...

				RANDY
		So while they're off investigating a dead
		end, Billy, who's been written off as a
		suspect, is busy planning his next
		hunting expedition.

				BILLY
			(o.c.)
		How do we know you're not the killer?

Randy spins around to find Billy right behind him.  Busted.

				RANDY
		Uh...hi, Billy.

				BILLY
		Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost it's
		reality button?

Randy shrugs, laughing it off.

				RANDY
		You're absolutely right. I'm the first
		to admit it. If this were a scary movie,
		I'd be the prime suspect.

				STU
		And what would be your motive?

				RANDY
		It's 1995--motives are incidental.

EXT.  MAIN STREET - LITTLE LATER

Dewey's patrol jeep makes it's way down mainstreet.  It's almost dark.  
The street is close to deserted.

INT.  PATROL JEEP - CONTINUOUS

Dewey's behind the wheel having a heated conversation with Tatum while 
Sid stares out the window.

				DEWEY
		A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.

				TATUM
		Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a 
		little blow out--we'll be perfectly safe.

Sid stares out the window. CLOSED SIGNS fill the storefronts, a few 
people rush to their car, in a hurry to beat curfew. 

				SIDNEY
		God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN 
		THAT DREADED SUNDOWN. 

				DEWEY
		Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout 
		some killer in Texas. 

				TATUM
		Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a 
		movie about you. Who's gonna play you? 

				SIDNEY
		Oh, god... 

Dewey comes to a stop, parking the car in front of the police station. 
He looks to Sid with a brotherly smile. 

				DEWEY
		I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself. 

				SIDNEY 
		Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd 
		cast Tori Spelling. 

EXT.  PATROL JEEP - CONTINUOUS 

They pile out of the jeep.  Dewey heads for the station. 

				DEWEY
		I'll just be a few minutes. Don't go 
		far.

The girls take off for the local supermarket that sits across the 
street. 

				SIDNEY
		Is Billy going to be there tonight? 

				TATUM 
		He better not be. I told Stu to keep his 
		mouth shut. I think we can live without 
		EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for 
		one night. 

They approach the grocery store.  Small and simple.  Sid and Tatum grab 
a shopping cart from the bin and enter the store, pushing the cart 
through two sliding glass doors. 

A lone CHECKOUT LADY behind the counter, big and frumpy, looks up from 
counting money. 

				CHECK OUT LADY 
		You girls gonna have to hurry it up. 
		We're under curfew. 

				TATUM 
		Two minutes tops. 

They make a bee-line for the junk food section just as the automated 
doors slide shut behind them and a... 

GHOST MASKED FIGURE appears, out of nowhere, standing just outside, 
watching, quietly through the glass store windows.

EXT.  POLICE STATION - SHERIFF'S OFFICE 

Sheriff Burke's face heats up as Deputy Riley marches in, hurriedly. 

				SHERIFF BURKE
		Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?

				DEWEY 
		Keeping my eye on Sidney. 

				SHERIFF BURKE 
		Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real 
		bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls 
		were listed to Neil Prescott--Sidney's 
		father. He made the calls with his cellular 
		phone. It's confirmed. 

				DEWEY 
		Couldn't his cellular number have been 
		cloned? 

				SHERIFF BURKE 
		There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? 
		The anniversary of his wife's death. It all 
		fits. He's our man. 

				DEWEY 
		Have you contacted the bureau? 

				SHERIFF BURKE 
		They believe he's out of state by now. 
		We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in 
		effect through the night. If he's not 
		picked up by morning--we'll do a house 
		to house. 

				DEWEY 
		You think he could still be in town? 

				SHERIFF BURKE 
		He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney? 

				DEWEY 
		She's with my sister. Should I bring her 
		in? 

				SHERIFF BURKE 
		Hold off for now. Just stay close to 
		her. 

				DEWEY 
		She'll be with her friends over at Stu 
		Maker's tonight. 

				SHERIFF BURKE 
		Watch her. Don't let on--just keep your 
		eyes out. 

				DEWEY
		Yes, sir. 

INT.  SUPERMARKET - FEW MINUTES LATER 

Sidney and Tatum push a basket through the junk food section.  The 
store is completely empty.  The girls gab freely. 

				SIDNEY 
		Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I 
		just can't relax. 

				TATUM 
		You have a few intimacy issues as a 
		result of your mother's untimely death.
		It's no big deal. You'll thaw out. 

				SIDNEY 
		But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. 
		You know, with all the sex stuff. How 
		many guys would put up with a girlfriend 
		who's sexually anorexic? 

				TATUM 
		Billy and his penis don't deserve you. 

Sidney grabs some chips and salsa from the shelf.  Down the aisle, 
through the storefront window the GHOST MASKED FIGURE still stands 
watching their every move. 

EXT.  SUPERMARKET 

Sid pushes the cart out of the glass door with Tatum riding it.  The 
GHOST MASKED FIGURE is nowhere to be found. 

				SIDNEY 
		What do you think about when you're 
		having sex? 

				TATUM 
		With Stu, there's little time to stop and 
		reflect. But sometimes before, to relax 
		and get in the mood, I think about Grant 
		Goodeve. 

Sid pushes the cart and Tatum across the street. 

				SIDNEY 
		Who? 

				TATUM 
		Grant Goodeve--the oldest brother on 
		EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He 
		was the one who lived off alone. He would come 
		around every now and then with his guitar and 
		sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..."
		He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot 
		brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I 
		was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show 
		came on every day after school right during my 
		puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental 
		in my maturing as a woman. 

				SIDNEY 
		How does that get you in the mood with 
		Stu? 

				TATUM 
		During foreplay, I sing the theme song to 
		myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives 
		with love..." It's a real turn on. 

				SIDNEY 
		No way. 

				TATUM 
		Grant wrote the song himself. I'm 
		convinced the lyrics had a secret
		meaning, "Eight is enough..." 

Sid pushes the cart up to Dewey's jeep.  Tatum hops off. 

				SIDNEY 
		What secret meaning? Like a Satanical 
		thing? 

				TATUM 
		Watch the show, Sid. His basket is 
		bigger than the one you're pushing. 

				SIDNEY 
		TATUM! 

				TATUM 
		Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits 
		til he's dead but the minute you mention 
		an eight inch weenie. Watch out. 

Sidney stops just short of a laugh.  Tatum pulls the back jeep door, 
loading the groceries in.  Behind her, the GHOST MASKED FIGURE appears, 
just out of their sight, behind the jeep's open back door. 

				TATUM 
		There's that sense of humor. I knew it 
		still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some 
		fun tonight. 

				SIDNEY 
		Deal. 

Sidney moves to the back door and closes it shut, when from behind... 

DEWEY stands.  Sid jumps, startled. 

				DEWEY 
		You girls ready. 

				SIDNEY 
		Yeah. 

				DEWEY 
		Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard 
		tonight, Sid. 

				TATUM 
		No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night. 

				DEWEY 
		Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the 
		way, I promise. 

				TATUM 
		Shit. 

Tatum kicks the shopping cart out of the way, blindly.  It rolls down 
the road by itself, gaining speed on a decline running smack into the 
GHOST MASKED FIGURE who stops the cart cold with one hand. 

EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT 

Dewey's jeep makes it's way down a long, winding road.  Headlights 
illuminate the thick woods that line each side.  Following behind them 
at a discreet distance is a huge white newsvan. 

Dewey comes to the end of the road.  It dead ends at... 

STU'S HOUSE which sits alone in a clearing, big and ominous with no 
neighbors in sight.  A huge old home just ripe for a night of fun 
and...terror. 

From the looks of things the party has already started.  Music is 
BLARING. A few KIDS hang on the porch. 

INT.  LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER 

A big room with KIDS sprinkled throughout-smoking, drinking, cutting 
up.  A stereo BLASTS music while the TV airs around the clock killer 
coverage. 

Tatum and Sid enter with groceries.  Various FRIENDS greet them. 

				TATUM 
		Caterer's here. 

The girls carry bags through a hallway that opens up onto an enormous 
kitchen.  Stu and some GUYS are leaning over the sink drinking beer 
through a funnel. 

				TATUM 
		That's mature. 

				STU 
		Where you guys been? We had to start 
		without you. 

EXT.  STU'S HOUSE - ROAD 

The newsvan pulls up and parks unobtrusively on the side of the road a 
few feet down from the front yard. 

INT.  NEWSVAN 

Kenny and Gale move around inside the van.  Kenny hovers over a control 
panel complete with video monitors. 

				KENNY 
		What's the plan? 

				GALE 
		Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a 
		window and tape all of tonight's
		festivities. 

Kenny picks up a compact video camera the size of his fist.  He checks 
its battery pack. 

				KENNY 
		The control board's glitched. You know 
		we can't carry a live picture. 

				GALE 
		What's the delay? 

				KENNY 
		About thirty seconds. 

				GALE 
		As long as it records I don't give a 
		shit. We're not doing a remote. 

Gale slides open the side door and steps out into the darkness, not 
seeing the FIGURE that stands behind her.  A hand grabs her shoulder, 
Gale's heart stops as she spins around to find... 

Dewey, smiling, extremely pleased to see her. 

				DEWEY 
		Evening, ma'am. 

				GALE 
		Deputy...good evening. 

				DEWEY 
		What brings you out to these parts? 

				GALE 
		You never know when or where a story will 
		break. 

				DEWEY 
		Not much story here. Just a bunch of 
		kids cutting loose. 

				GALE 
		Then what are you doing here? 

				DEWEY 
		Keeping an eye on things. Checking the 
		place out. 

				GALE 
		Mind if I join you? 

Dewey considers for a whole two seconds. 

				DEWEY 
		Not at all. 

Gale leans in the van, grabs the camera from  Kenny's hand, and throws 
it in her bag.  She gives Kenny a wink. 

INT.  KITCHEN 

CLOSE ON a microwave.  Popcorn POPS inside.  CAMERA WIDENS TO REVEAL... 

Sid, Stu, and Tatum moving about the kitchen, preparing a junk food 
feast.  Other TEENS pop in and out. Randy appears amongst them.  He 
carries an armful of videos. 

				RANDY 
		I thought we'd make it a BLOCKBUSTER 
		night. 

He lets the videos splatter across the kitchen counter.  Stu and Tatum 
dive in. 

				STU 
		I thought everything was checked out. 

				RANDY 
		I had 'em hid in the foreign section. 

Sidney peruses the videos. 

				SIDNEY 
		THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT 
		--How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these 
		movies? 

				RANDY 
		She's the Scream Queen. 

				STU 
		With that set of lungs--she should be. 

				TATUM 
			(to Sid) 
		Tits--see. 

INT.  LIVING ROOM - FEW MINUTES LATER 

The party is going strong.  Ten maybe fifteen people stand, sit, lean.  
Some crowd around the floor in front of the television.  Randy is 
taking a vote. 

				RANDY 
		How many EVIL DEAD'S? 
			(hands go up) 
		How many HELLRAISER'S? 

Hands go up.  BICKERING AD-LIB, etc. 

The doorbell RINGS.  Stu goes for it. 

				STU 
		I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're 
		in the fridge in the garage. 

				TATUM 
		What am I? The beer wench? 

				STU 
			(o.c.) 
		Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick 
		from INSIDE STORY? 

They look up the hallway to see Dewey and Gale standing in the foyer. 

				TATUM 
		Shit, Dewey! 

Everyone perks up, eyeing Gale. 

				TATUM 
		What is she doing here? 

				DEWEY 
		She's with me. I just wanted to check on 
		things. 

The GUYS in the room are drooling over Gale.  Including Stu. 

				TATUM 
		So you did--now leave...and take your 
		media muff with you. 

Tatum takes off for the kitchen. 

Gale has quickly become the focus of the party.  All eyes are on her. 

				SOME TEEN 
		I watch your show regularly. 

				STU 
		This must be big news to be on INSIDE 
		STORY. 

				GALE 
		Huge. 

				ANOTHER TEEN 
		Wanna interview us? 

				RANDY 
		We could be like two grief stricken 
		students and we'll say really nice things 
		about our good friends who were 
		slaughtered senselessly. 

				STU 
		I can cry on cue. 

Gale eyes the bookshelf above the television. 

				GALE 
		Maybe later? 

Suddenly, Gale starts to COUGH. 

				GALE 
		Can I trouble you for some water? 

				STU 
		How 'bout a beer? Randy--get the lady a 
		beer. 

				RANDY 
		You get it. 

Gale slips the camera from her bag--hits the ON switch and holds it 
behind her...waiting for the right moment. 

BACK IN FOYER 

				SIDNEY 
		Have they found my father? 

				DEWEY 
		Afraid not. 

				SIDNEY 
		Should I be worried? 

				DEWEY 
		Not yet. 

INT.  KITCHEN 

Tatum is alone in the kitchen.  She empties popcorn into a bowl, then 
pulls open the refrigerator...looks quickly, then remembers... 

She moves through the adjoining laundry room to the... 

INT.  GARAGE 

The kitchen door opens and light floods the darkened garage.  Tatum 
stands in the doorway searching for a light switch. 

She finds a button and hits it.  BRRRRMMM!  The electric garage door 
starts to rise.  Wrong switch.  She hits it again and it closes. 

She finds another switch.  CLICK.  A small lightbulb overhead comes on, 
barely lighting the large two car garage, leaving pockets of shadows 
along the wall. 

Tatum spots the refrigerator against a far wall and heads for it, not 
seeing the kitchen door, quietly, slowly, closing behind her, sealing 
her off from the rest of the house. 

Tatum stumbles to the refrigerator and throws it open.  Its light casts 
a glow across her face. 

CRASH-BOOM! 

Tatum jumps, spinning around just in time to see a cat escape through a 
large pet door that's built into the garage door.  She smiles at her 
jumpiness. 

Tatum loads up with as many beer as her hands will carry and heads back 
to the kitchen. 

At the kitchen door, she juggles the beer, reaching for the knob.  It's 
locked. 

				TATUM 
		SHIT! 

She KICKS it with her foot several times. 

				TATUM 
		Hey, Shitheads! 

A moment.  No answer. 

				TATUM 
		OH, SHIT PISS! 

Tatum leans over and, with her elbow, hits the garage door button.  
BRRRMM!  It begins to rise. 

She moves towards the rising door, beer in hand.  Suddenly, CRR-BRRRM!  
The garage door RESETS, reversing direction, moving down, closing. 

				TATUM 
		What the... 

Tatum spins around to see.. 

A GHOST MASKED FIGURE 

Silhouetted in the dark, next to the kitchen door, his hand on the 
switch.  Tatum at once GASPS, taken back, but then relaxes. 

				TATUM 
		Is that you, Randy? Cute. 

The FIGURE stares at her, blankly. 

				TATUM 
		And what movie is this from? I SPIT ON 
		YOUR GARAGE. 

Tatum takes a step towards the FIGURE. 

				TATUM 
		Lose the mask. If Sidney sees it, she'll 
		flip. 

The FIGURE shakes his head slowly from side to side. 

				TATUM 
		Oh, you wanna play psycho killer? 

The FIGURE slowly nods. 

				TATUM 
		Can I be the helpless victim? 

The FIGURE slowly nods again. 

				TATUM 
		Okay, let's see. "No, please don't kill 
		me, Mr. Ghostface. I want to be in the
		sequel." 

Tatum takes a step to move around the FIGURE, but he steps too, 
blocking her. 

				TATUM 
		Cut, Casper. That's a wrap. 

Tatum moves again, sidestepping the FIGURE, but he's faster and cuts 
her off. 

Tatum juggles the beer against her chest with one hand and with the 
other pushes the FIGURE hard, knocking him aside. 

				TATUM 
		Randy--will you stop? 

But as the FIGURE intercepts, lunging forward, grabbing her wrist hard, 
Tatum stumbles...beer cans hit the floor, spewing... 

				TATUM 
		You little shit. 

Tatum yanks hard, releasing his hold when a flash of silver catches her 
eye.  She looks down, glimpsing a long sharp blade as it darts forward, 
cutting into her forearm... 

Tatum pulls back, horrified, as the moment turns deadly serious. 

The FIGURE advances on her--knife out, ready.  She staggers backwards, 
holding her bloody arm, backing into the refrigerator, SCREAMING. 

				TATUM 
		Who are you? 

The FIGURE lashes out with the knife.  Tatum dodges it, leaping back 
against the fridge.  The FIGURE advances.  Instinctively, she rips the 
top freezer door open, BASHING the FIGURE in the face, sending him 
backwards, reeling. 

Tatum bolts to the...CLOSED GARAGE DOOR.  In a panic, she BEATS and 
PULLS
on it, trying to make it lift.  She eyes the FIGURE...he's 
recovering... 

She goes for the pet door, dropping to the floor, diving for it...she 
wedges her upper body through, her head, shoulders, torso just as 
the... 

FIGURE pounces, grabbing hold of her feet.  Tatum goes crazy SCREAMING 
and KICKING trying to get through. 

EXT.  GARAGE DOOR 

Tatum is half in/half out of the pet door.  She BEATS and JERKS wildly, 
unable to see the FIGURE on the other side... 

A true fighter, Tatum kicks hard, making direct contact with the 
FIGURE, knocking him away. 

She takes the moment to pull herself through further...but she 
stops...stuck.  She pulls and tugs but can't move.  She listens but 
hears nothing.  Where did he go?  An agonizing silence.  And then... 

CRR-BRRRM!  The garage door is activated.  It begins to rise upward, 
taking
Tatum with it.  She SCREAMS MADLY. 

				TATUM 
		NOOOOOOOO..... 

Tatum's arms and legs fly about violently as she tries to free herself 
from the door, but it moves too fast, carrying her up... 

She looks above to see where the door rolls back into garage rafters 
just as her neck hits the first beam, SNAPPING instantly. 

INT.  FOYER - MINUTES LATER 

It's getting late and SOME KIDS leave through the front door, 
muttering, "parents and curfew", etc.  The door hangs open wide.  Sid 
moves to close it when.... 

BILLY appears in a classic fake scare. 

				SIDNEY 
		Billy? Jesus, you scared me. 

Stu appears. 

				STU 
			(with a wink) 
		Dude. What are you doing here? 

				BILLY 
		I was hoping Sid and I could talk. 

				SIDNEY 
		If Tatum sees you--she'll draw blood. 

				STU 
		You guys can go up to my parents room? 
		To talk and...whatever. 

				BILLY 
		Subtlety, Stu. Look it up. 

				SIDNEY 
		It's okay. We need to talk. 

Sid grabs his hand and leads him up the staircase.  Randy appears from 
the kitchen just in time to see Sid and Billy disappear upstairs. 

				RANDY 
		What's Leatherface doing here? 

				STU 
		He came to make up. 

				RANDY 
		There goes my chance with Sid. 

				STU 
		Like you had one. 

INT.  NEWSVAN 

Kenny fidgets at the control board.  He hits a coupla buttons, bangs 
the side of the monitor and a picture emerges...the living room.  The 
camera is positioned just above the television... 

ON SCREEN 

The party is in full swing.  Several TEENS sit right in front of the 
television.  Because of the camera's position they appear to be staring 
right into the lens. 

Suddenly, the van's side door slides open and Gale pops in. 

				KENNY 
		Got a picture. Perfect placement. We 
		can see everything. 

Gale is ecstatic. 

				GALE 
		Tell me, Kenny, has a cheesy tabloid 
		journalist ever won the Pulitzer? 

INT.  BEDROOM 

A large, master bedroom with glass doors that lead out onto a balcony. 

Sid and Billy stare at each other for a long moment.  Awkward. 

				SIDNEY 
		So... 

				BILLY 
		So...I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit 
		and I'm sorry. 

				SIDNEY 
		No, Billy. I'm the one who's been 
		selfish and self-absorbed with all of my
		post traumatic stress. 

				BILLY 
		You lost your mom... 

				SIDNEY 
		But you're right--enough is enough. I 
		can't wallow in the grief process forever 
		and I can't keep lying to myself about 
		who my mom was. 

Billy bows his head quietly, knowingly. 

				SIDNEY 
		I think in some weird analytical, 
		psychological bullshit way I'm scared 
		I'm gonna turn out just like her, you 
		know? Like the bad seed or something... 

				BILLY 
		Oh Sidney... 

				SIDNEY 
		Everytime I get close to you I see my 
		mom. I know it doesn't make sense. 

				BILLY 
		Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in 
		SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she 
		kept having flashbacks of her dead father. 

				SIDNEY 
		But this is life. This isn't a movie. 

				BILLY 
		Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's 
		one great big movie. Only you can't 
		pick your genre. 

Billy moves to her.  They embrace, tenderly. 

				SIDNEY 
		I wanna let go. I do... 

				BILLY 
		Ssshh...everything's gonna be okay. I 
		promise. 

Sidney takes the initiative, acting on impulse, kissing him long and 
hard.  She breaks away passionately, out of breath. 

				SIDNEY 
		Why can't I be a Meg Ryan movie? 

Billy nibbles her neck. 

				BILLY 
		Sshh..it's okay. 

				SIDNEY 
		Or even a good porno. 

				BILLY 
			(shocked) 
		What? 

She stares at him, her eyes sexually charged. 

				SIDNEY 
		You heard me. 

				BILLY 
			(incredulous) 
		Are you serious? 

				SIDNEY 
			(surprising herself) 
		Yeah...I think so. 

They smile at each other. 

INT.  LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER 

The camera sits on the book shelf lodged between two knickknacks, 
completely inconspicuous. The CAMERA WIDENS to reveal several TEENS 
watching the TV--the horror diehards. 

				TEEN #1 
		Look, here it comes. SPLAT! 

				TEEN #2 
		The blood's not the right color. Why do 
		they do that? It's too red. 

				RANDY 
		Here comes another... 

				TEEN #3 
		Predictable. Knew he was going to bite 
		it. 

				BORED TEEN 
		How can you watch this shit over and 
		over? 

				RANDY 
		Shhhhh. 

				STU 
		I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do 
		we see Jamie Lee's breasts? 

				RANDY 
		Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie 
		Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. 
		She didn't show her tits until she went legit. 

				BOY TEEN 
		No way. 

				RANDY 
		That's why she always lived. Only 
		virgins can outsmart the killer in the
		big chase scene in the end. Don't you 
		know the rules? 

Stu finishes his beer. 

				STU 
		What rules? 

Randy hits the pause button on the remote and stands in front of the 
television, explaining. 

				RANDY 
		There are certain rules that one must 
		abide by in order to successfully survive 
		a horror movie. For instance: 1. You 
		can never have sex. The minute you get a 
		little nookie--you're as good as gone. 
		Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink 
		or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an 
		extension of number one. And 3. Never, 
		ever, ever, under any circumstances, say 
		"I'll be right back." 

				STU 
		Wanna another beer? 

				RANDY 
		Yeah. 

				STU 
		I'll be right back. 

Everybody "ooohhs". 

				RANDY 
		There he goes folks--a dead man. Wave 
		bye-bye. 

INT.  NEWSVAN - CONTINUOUS

Gale and Kenny watch the monitor.  The party is clearing out some

A RAP at the van door.  Gale pulls it open to see Deputy Riley 
standing, his face all smiles.

				DEWEY
		Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check
		out a possible lead. Thought you might 
		like to join me.

				GALE
		What kind of lead?

				DEWEY
		A car was spotted in the bushes a little
		ways up the road.

				GALE
		I'd love to. If you're sure it's
		alright?

				DEWEY
		Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.

				GALE
		Can I bring Kenny?

				DEWEY
			(too quickly)
		NO! I mean...I should probably take just 
		you.

Gale steps out of the van turning back to Kenny.

				GALE
		I'll be back.

She slides the van door closed.

EXT.  ROAD - CONTINUOUS

Gale heads for Dewey's patrol jeep.

				DEWEY
		Actually, I thought we could walk. It's
		not far.

Gale appears skeptical, but smiles anyway.  She's genuinely smitten by 
this young guy.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

SCARY MUSIC fills the room.  The party is reduced to the diehards in 
front of the television.

				RANDY
			(pointing to TV)
		Look, here comes the obligatory tit shot.

				OTHER GUYS
		Beautiful! Finally!

INT.  BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Billy and Sidney are going at it...passionately.  He has his head 
buried in her neck.

				SIDNEY
			(to herself)
		"Eight is enough to fill our lives with
		love..."

It's working.  Sidney pushes Billy off her as she pulls her shirt over 
her head.  She fumbles with the clasp of her bra as the...

CAMERA RUSHES IN on her breasts.  Just as Sid's bra straps slide of her 
shoulders...

Billy moves in front of the CAMERA, pulling his jeans off, Blocking 
Sidney from view.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

Back in the living room, the horror fest continues when the phone 
RINGS.  Everyone ignores it.  It RINGS again.

Finally, Randy grabs the receiver from the side table.

				RANDY
		Hello? Yeah....HOLY SHIT.

Randy, freaked, drops the phone, finds the TV remote and pauses the 
movie, the others protest
"Hey, Put is back..." etc.

				RANDY
		Listen up. They found Principal Himbry
		dead. He was gutted and hung from the
		goal post on the football field.

This stills the room.  Complete silence as the news sinks in.  ON 
different faces...a moment of devastation..disbelief.  And then:

				TEEN #1
		So what are we waiting for?

				TEEN #2
		Let's get over there before they pry him
		down.

And in seconds the room is empty as everyone bolts for the 
door..HOOTIN' and HOLLERIN' ...leaving Randy, near drunk, alone in the 
living room.  He returns to the movie.

				RANDY
		We were just getting to the good part.

INT.  NEWSVAN - MINUTES LATER

Kenny is barely watching the monitor, he reached boredom some time ago.  
He finds a bag of Cheetos and chows down when he hears SCREAMING from 
outside.  He peers out the window to see the last of the PARTY KIDS 
pile into two cars and race off down the road.

He chews a Cheeto slowly, his interest piqued.

INT.  BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

The sex is over...and both Sid and Billy are dressing respectively.  
That post-sex awkwardness.

Sid brushes out her hair as her eyes come to rest on the telephone on 
the nightstand...it puzzles her as a stark reveleation crosses her 
face.  She turns to Billy who sits on the floor, putting on his shoes.

				SIDNEY
		Who did you call?

				BILLY
		What?

				SIDNEY
		When you're arrested-you're allowed one 
		phone call? Who did you call?

				BILLY
		I called my dad.

				SIDNEY
		No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw
		him.

				BILLY
		Yeah...and when I called no one answered.

				SIDNEY
		Uh-huh.

				BILLY
		You don't still think it was me?

				SIDNEY
		No, but if it were you, that would have
		been a very clever way to throw me off
		track. Using your one phone call to call
		me so I wouldn't think it was you.

Billy stands up.

				BILLY
		What do I have to do to prove to you I'm
		not a killer?

He makes a move toward her when..from behind, in a split instant, from 
the open balcony doors comes...

THE GHOST FIGURE

Sidney sees the FIGURE immedietely, SCREAMING.  Billy tries to calm 
her, oblivious to the advancing GHOST.

				SIDNEY
		BILLYWATCHOUT!!!!

Billy barely turns as a long steely blade rises high in the air.  It 
strikes down with force...hitting his chest as blood sprays the air.

ON SIDNEY as red crimson splatters across her face...as the knife is 
thrust in and out of Billy who tries hard to put up a fight..but it's 
useless...he never had a chance.  His body falls to the 
floor..lifeless.

ANGLE ON GHOST

as he watches Billy's body come to a still before quietly, calmly 
turning his attention to...

SIDNEY who stands, numb...scared to death.  And only when the GHOST 
takes a step forward does Sidney break.  She takes off like a 
rocket...leaping over the bed and out the door.

INT.  HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Sidney tears out the door and down the hall, coated in Billy's blood.

ANGLE ON THE GHOST

as he catches up with her, grabbing hold of her collar.  She pulls away 
from him...her shirt ripping down the back.

Her hands find a door knob and she goes for it, pulling the door 
open...moving quickly inside...locking it behind her.

INT.  DARK SPACE - CONTINUOUS

Total darkness.  Sidney's hands scour the wall for a light switch.  The 
doorknob turns...the lock holds..as the door is nearly SHAKEN from it's 
hinges...and then...

NOTHING.  All goes silent.  Only Sidney's rapid BREATHING fills the 
space around her.

Sidney, trembling, shaking, reaches above her, feeling, until she finds 
a string.  She pulls it...as a lightbulb SWITCHES on overhead.

She's in a small box of a room.  The door is on one side, a small, 
narrow staircase on the other.  She eyes the doorknob, then the 
staircase...contemplating...but it's an easy decision.  There's no 
fucking way she's going up to the attic.

She unlocks the door and pushes on it.  But it won't give...she pushes 
on it again.  It's locked from the other side.  Shit.  She turns to the 
staircase.

EXT.  DARK ROAD - CONTINUOUS

A long, deserted country road.  In the distance, a single flashlight 
beams ahead, the only light in the black night.  Gale and Dewey can be 
heard.

				GALE
		So is Dewey your real name?

				DEWEY
		Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck
		with a long time ago.

				GALE
		I like it. It's... sexy.

				DEWEY
		Nah... it's just this town's way of not
		taking me serious.

				GALE
		What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a
		meteorologist...

CLOSE ON Gale and Dewey, walking closely, side by side-flirtatiously.  
Gale is surprisingly nervous.

				GALE
		People treat me like the Antichrist of
		television journalism.

				DEWEY
		I don't think you're so bad.

Gale smiles.

				GALE
		Are all the local boys as sweet as you?

Dewey blushes.  He starts to say something when headlights appear 
behind them.  They both spin as TWO CARS loaded with KIDS come racing 
right at them.

Dewey grabs Gale and pushes her off the road... just as the cars speed 
by, oblivious to them.

IN THE DITCH

Gale lands face up with Dewey right on top of her.  He steals a glance 
in her eyes before rolling off her.

				DEWEY
		You okay?

Something takes Gale's attention.

				GALE
		What's that?

Dewey looks to where gale points.  He finds the flashlight and aims it 
into the bush.  The tail end of a car is just visible.

				DEWEY
		Looks like a car.

Dewey helps her up and they move to it.  He shines the flashlight on 
the plates but it's already obvious to the CAMERA.  This is the same 
car we last saw Sidney's father driving away in.

				DEWEY
		Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.

				GALE
		Sidney's father?

				DEWEY
		We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here.
		What the fuck is he doing here?

Dewey is panicked.  He grabs Gale and they race off down the road.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Randy continues to watch TV.  He is now sloppy drunk, completely 
involved in the movie on the screen.

SCARY MUSIC SWELLS, filling the room.

				RANDY
			(to TV)
		No, Jamie. Look behind you! Watch out!
		Behind you!

And if he followed his own advice, he would see the GHOST MASKED FIGURE 
that stands directly behind him...knife poised.

INT.  NEWSVAN - CONTINUOUS

Kenny finishes off a soda and crushes the can in his hand.  He tosses 
it to the floor when a movement from the monitor catches his eye.

ON THE MONITOR is Randy, still on the couch, engrossed in the movie.  
Directly behind him...the GHOST.  Kenny does a double-take.  No fucking 
way.  He watches as the GHOST stands still, unmoving, knife raised.

				KENNY
		JESUS...FUCK...

The GHOST takes a silent step forward.

				KENNY
			(screaming at the monitor)
		BEHIND YOU! LOOK BEHIND YOU!

This kid needs help.  Kenny bolts out of his seat and goes for the side 
door.  He slides it open and sticks his head out as...

A LONG, SHARP BLADE

comes at Kenny, fast and furious...slicing into his throat.  Kenny 
falls forward...out the door as the GHOST MASKED FIGURE is upon him.

THE CAMERA PANS TO THE MONITOR

just in time to see the GHOST MASKED FIGURE turn away from Randy, 
leaving him unharmed, moving instead, out the front door, on a thirty 
second walk to the newsvan.

INT.  ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

The attic is long and narrow...cluttered with furniture, boxes, and the 
likes...moonlight filters in through a small raised window on the front 
wall of the house.

Sidney moves through the attic...BUMPING into this, KNOCKING over 
that...she passes a dusty mirror, jumping at her own reflection.  She 
cringes at her image, drenched in Billy's blood.  She stares long and 
hard...something about the blood, the redness of it.  She moves on, 
determined.

She eyes the raised window above her...a way out...if she could only 
reach it...

EXT.  FRONT YARD

Gale and Dewey come running up the drive, frantic.

				DEWEY
		I'll call for backup.

				GALE
		I'll get my camera.

They split up.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS GALE as she rushes to the newsvan, 
throwing open the door.

				GALE
		Kenny! Camera! Quick!

The van is empty.

				GALE
		Kenny?

A CAR HORN goes off.  Gale spins around.  It came from the patrol jeep 
in the driveway.

				GALE
			(calling out)
		Dewey?

She moves across the yard to the jeep, the door hangs open...Dewey is 
nowhere to be found.

				GALE
		Dewey? Where are you?

A look of pure dread comes over Gale.

INT.  ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

Sidney has stacked object after object building a ladder to the window.  
She climbs to the top, holding onto the window frame.

She spots Gale almost immedietely.  She SCREAMS OUT, looking for the 
window latch.  But there's not one.  It doesn't open.  Sidney starts 
beating on it...trying to break it...

EXT.  FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

Gale, hanging tough, approaches the front door, unable to hear Sidney's 
SCREAMS three floors up.  Gale reaches for the door just as she hears 
LOUD, HORRIBLE SHRIEKS from just inside.  She backs away.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

AN EAR-CURDLING JAMIE LEE CURTIS SCREAM BLASTS through the empty living 
room as the horror movie on TV comes to it's horrifying climax.

Randy is now gone.

EXT.  FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

Gale races across the yard putting distance between her and the house.  
She moves back to the van...

INT.  ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

Sidney has found an old tennis racket.  She swings a solid forehand at 
the window.

THE WINDOW SPRAYS GLASS

Sidney moves quickly, lifting herself up over broken glass and pulling 
herself through the window frame.

EXT.  SIDE OF THE HOUSE

Sidney wastes no time.  She looks for Gale, SCREAMING, but Gale is 
gone.

Sid lowers herself down the ledge, sliding down a sloped portion of the 
roof onto...

THE MASTER'S BEDROOM BALCONY.

Then she eases herself over the railing and lowers herself, letting 
herself hang as low as she can...then she lets go, free-falling the 
rest of the way...but in a split instant...

THE GHOST APPEARS

grabbing her wrists in midair.

Her body hangs, dangling against the side of the house.  The GHOST 
begins to lift her, pulling her back onto the balcony.

Sidney jerks, pulls, twists...but the HANDS have her, hoisting her 
up...Sidney SCREAMS MADLY...yanking one last time, freeing herself.

SHE DROPS TO THE GROUND, a good seven feet, landing on her back, 
hitting hard.  She grabs at a pained leg and brings herself upright.

INT.  NEWSVAN - CONTINUOUS

Gale is frantic.  She starts the engine up and hits the headlights when 
she discovers she can't see out of the windshield.

Gale rubs at the glass.  Sure enough, something is on the windshield 
outside, blocking her sight.  Gale hits the wipers as BLOOD SMEARS 
across the glass, it drips down from above.

Gale SCREAMS as a HAND reaches in through the open window...she looks 
up to see...

RANDY, staring at her madly.

				RANDY
		What's going on?

A sheer moment of fear as Gale hits the gas plummeting the car forward, 
into a ditch.  She hits the BRAKES.  Randy is thrown forward, away from 
the van.

Gale reverses, backs up, hits the brakes again...just as Kenny's face 
comes sliding down the outside of the windshield...eyes wide, face 
distorted, blood everywhere.

Gale hits the gas, and yanks the wheel, sending Kenny's corpse flying 
off the top of the van.

Gale spins the van around, onto the road, hits the gas madly, gaining 
speed just as...

SIDNEY APPEARS

in the middle of the road, drenched in blood, very much resembling a 
young Sissy Spacek.

Gale swerves to miss her, but she turns too sharp and the van veers off 
the road at top speed...flipping over on its side, sliding off into the 
thick foliage.

EXT.  ROAD - CONTINUOUS

Sidney races to where the van lay on it's side.  Sidney peers through 
the windshield...Gale's body lay limp and bloody.

SIDNEY CRIES OUT, turning, limping to the driveway.  She sees the 
patrol jeep with it's open door...she goes for it.

INT.  JEEP

Sidney hops in, reaches for the ignition...NO KEYS!  Shit.  Just then, 
Sidney's eyes go to the front porch.  She watches as the front door 
opens and a FIGURE appears in the darkness, undetectable.

Sidney throws the headlights...illuminating the front side of the 
house, revealing...

DEWEY STANDING IN THE DOORWAY.

				SIDNEY
		DEWEY!

Sidney opens the jeep door, moving to him, noticing his body, slumped, 
knees buckled...

And then his body falls forward, slowly, deliberately, hitting the 
porch hard.  Standing behind him is...

THE GHOST

SIDNEY SCREAMS FROM THE BOTTOM OF HER SOUL.

				SIDNEY
		NOOOOOOOO!!!!!

Sid jumps back inside the jeep, closing the door, locking it.  She 
reaches over and locks the passenger's door and then she...waits.

And watches as the GHOST leans over Dewey's still body, fumbling with 
something.  Then the FIGURE stands upright, in his hands he holds...

THE KEYS

They jingle in the wind, the GHOST toying with her, enjoying this...

Sidney, hysterical, locks eyes with the FIGURE as he moves to the door, 
Sidney leaps on it, holding the lock button down, making it impossible 
to unlock.  Her face is pressed against the glass...inches from the 
MASKED FIGURE.

She uses every ounce of strength when suddenly, the GHOST DISAPPEARS, 
dropping down, below the window, out of her view.

Sidney moves to the center of the jeep, trying hard to listen over her 
own RAPID BREATHING, every sound AMPLIFIED.

Then she hears it, the soft JINGLING of keys near the passengers side 
door.  She pounces on the lock, holding it down.

A shadow cuts the beam of the headlights, unseen by Sidney.  The lock 
turns on the other side.  Sidney leaps over and holds it down, securing 
it.  This is beyond nerve-racking.  Sidney is certifiable.

Her eyes spot the police radio for the first time.  She grabs the 
mouthpiece and hits the switch.

				SIDNEY
		Help! Please! I'm at Stu Maker's house
		on Turner Lane. Please, HE'S GONNA
		KILL ME!

EXT.  FRONT OF JEEP

ANGLE through front windshield.  Sidney RANTING into the police band.  
She doesn't see the...

GHOST FIGURE open the tailgate door of the jeep and slowly crawl in 
behind her.

The GHOST FIGURE reaches out and grabs hold of Sidney's neck.

Sidney, with surprising strength, spins around and attacks the GHOST.

She falls back against the dash, legs out, kicking wildly at him.

Her hand reaches for the door, finds the lock, the door lever, she 
pulls...

The door swings open...

Sidney falls out of the door, hitting the ground.

EXT.  FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

Sidney, on her stomach, squirms away from the jeep.  She brings herself 
up to her hands and knees, looking behind her to see nothing...

THE GHOST HAS DISAPPEARED.

Sidney's eyes roam the yard but he's nowhere.  Completely gone.  
Vanished.  Sid crawls to the front porch where...

DEWEY'S BODY LAY

Thinking quickly, precisely, she reaches to Dewey's holster and grabs 
his gun when a VOICE ECHO'S behind her...

				VOICE
			(o.c.)
		Sidney!

She turns to see Randy racing to her, limping.  He appears stone cold 
sober.

				RANDY
		Jesus, Sid. We gotta get out of here.

Sidney throws the gun forward.

				SIDNEY
		Stop. Right there.

				RANDY
		Don't shoot. It's me.

				SIDNEY
		Don't come any closer.

				RANDY
		Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's
		dead, she's been killed...I think Stu did
		it.

He takes a step forward when another VOICE SPEAKS UP.

				VOICE
			(o.c.)
		Don't believe him, Sid.

Sidney spins around to see Stu moving up the walk.

				STU
		He's lying. He killed Tatum. And Billy.

Stu moves closer to Sidney.

				SIDNEY
		Stay away.

She aims the gun in his direction.

				STU
		His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid.
		He's gone psycho.

				RANDY
		Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the
		one.

Sidney has lost it, she doesn't know who to trust.  She aims the gun at 
Stu..then Randy..then Stu...

				STU
		Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.

				RANDY
		No, Sid.

They both move toward her.  There's no time.  She must act now.  
Finally...

				SIDNEY
		Fuck you both.

And with that, Sidney steps back into the house and SLAMS the front 
door shut.

INT.  LIVING ROOM / FOYER

Sid locks and bolts the door.  From the other side she can hear Randy 
SCREAMING.

				RANDY
		NO, SID. OPEN UP. PLEASE...
		HE'S GONE CRAZY.

His fists POUND against the door.  Sidney, stumbling in the darkness, 
rushes to the phone in the living room.  Just as she reaches for 
it...it RINGS.  It scares the life out of her.  She SCREAMS, yanking it 
up.

				SIDNEY
		Please! God! Help me!

				VOICE
			(from the phone)
		Having fun Sidney?

Sidney falls apart, SCREAMING.

				SIDNEY
		NOOOOOOOOO!!!

She throws the phone down, disconnecting the call.

Sid moves back to the door.  RANDY'S SCREAMS ARE MADDENING.  She eyes 
the lock, deliberating.

				SIDNEY
			(at the door)
		GOAWAYLEAVEMEALONE!

CLUNK!  A NOISE UPSTAIRS.

Sidney looks up the staircase, into the darkness, her face SHOCKED to 
see...

BILLY

emerging from the shadows, stumbling down the stairs.  Very much alive.

				SIDNEY
		Oh God. Billy!

He's blood-soaked and dazed.  Sidney meets him in the landing, grabbing 
him, holding him...

				SIDNEY
		I thought you were...

				BILLY
		I'm alright. Gotta...get...help.

Billy goes for the door.

				SIDNEY
		He's out there.

Randy continues POUNDING ON THE DOOR, SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF HIS 
LUNGS.

				RANDY
			(through door)
		Please, you gotta let me in. He's
		gonna kill me.

Billy goes for the door.  Sidney blocks him.

				SIDNEY
		NO! Don't believe him.

				BILLY
		It's okay. Give me the gun.

Sidney hands him the gun.  Billy turns and unlocks the door, opening 
it.  Randy rushes in, grabbing Billy, pleading...

				RANDY
		Help me...

				BILLY
			(calming him)
		Shhhh. It's okay.

				RANDY
		Stu's flipped out. He's gone mad.

Slowly, a small smile creeps across Billy's face.

				BILLY
		"We all go a little mad sometimes."

Randy squints, confused, as Billy aims the gun at Randy and pulls the 
trigger.  The BLAST throws Randy's body against the wall before sliding 
to a heap on the floor...still.

				BILLY
		Anthony Perkins--PSYCHO

BILLY TURNS TO SIDNEY...

Who stands only feet away, face aghast...

Fuck, no...this can't be happening.  Billy's eyes are on her, unmoving.

He sticks his tongue out and slowly licks the blood dried to his 
face...tasting it.

				BILLY
		Corn syrup. Same stuff they used for
		pig's blood in CARRIE.

Sidney is dumbfounded.  Slowly, she takes a step back, moving into the 
dark refines of the kitchen.

Billy, lurches forward in a fake-out, baiting her.  She takes another 
step back--petrified.

CLOSE ON BILLY'S FACE.  It is no longer familiar to Sidney.  There is 
something inhuman now about his features.  His expression is pure evil.

She takes another step back, shrinking into the dark kitchen.

THE CAMERA TAKES A MOMENT TO ADJUST TO THE DARKNESS as the outline of a 
FIGURE appears...

STANDING RIGHT BEHIND SIDNEY.

She continues to back up, moving right into the arms of...

STU

Sidney spins around...her mouth open in speechless horror.

				SIDNEY
		Stu...please...help me...

Stu stares back at her, eyes wide, lips curled in a subtle smile as he 
holds a small compact CELLULAR PHONE up to his face.

				STU
			(whispering into phone)
		Surprise, Sidney.

His VOICE sounds affected now...the VOICE of the killer.

Sidney looks back to Billy, then to Stu, then to Billy again.  It 
becomes all too clear.

She stands between them, her mind racing, calculating...

SHE BOLTS INTO THE LIVING ROOM

If for no other reason than to put space between her and them...they 
stand in the entryway, trapping her in.

				BILLY
		Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've
		got one more surprise--Stu, I believe it's 
		your turn.

				STU
		Oh yeah

Stu disappears into the kitchen.

				BILLY
			(to Sidney)
		What's wrong? You look like you've seen
		a ghost.

Sidney stands, trying hard to hold a calm resolve.

A NOISE comes from the kitchen.  A low dragging sound.  Stu reappears 
from the front hall...wrestling with something...someone...

CLOSE ON STU...he has a body in tow, he thrusts it forward and it rolls 
into the living room.  Sidney looks down to find...

HER FATHER

bound and gagged.  His eyes wide in fear, very much alive.

				SIDNEY
		Daddy!

She starts for him.

				BILLY
		Close enough.

Stu places the cellular phone in Mr. Prescott's shirt pocket.

				STU
		Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.

				SIDNEY
		Why are you doing this?

				STU
		It's all part of the game.

				BILLY
		It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!

				SIDNEY
		Fuck you.

				BILLY
		We already played that game. You lost,
		remember?

				STU
		You have to play, Sid. Don't want to
		disappoint your dad. He's been waiting
		around all night.

				BILLY
		It's an easy game. We ask you a
		question. If you get it wrong--you die.

				STU
		And if you get it right--you die.

				SIDNEY
		You're crazy--both of you.

				STU
		The official term is "psychotic".

				SIDNEY
		You'll never get away with this.

				BILLY
		Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't
		believe how easy it was to frame him.

				STU
		Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took
		a few notes. It was fun.

Billy and Stu relish their madness, proud of themselves.

Sidney looks to her dad, sees the tears in his eyes.  She looks back to 
Billy, unflinching..a determined look on her face.

				SIDNEY
		Why did you kill my mother?

				BILLY
		Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I
		think she wants a motive. Hmmm...I don't
		really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did
		Norman Bates have a motive?

Stu plays along, shaking his head.

				STU
		Nope.

				BILLY
		And did they really ever explain why
		Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people?
		Don't think so. You see, it's scarier
		when there's no motive, Sid.

				SIDNEY
			(fighting tears)
		I don't understand...

				BILLY
		We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman
		was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit
		all over town like she was Sharon Stone or 
		something.

				STU
			(laughing)
		..so we put her out of her misery. I
		mean, let's face it, your mom was no
		Sharon Stone.

Stu cracks up over this while Billy turns very serious.

				BILLY
		Is that motive enough for you? Or how
		about this? Did you know your slut
		mother was sleeping with my dad and she's
		the reason my mom moved out and deserted
		me.

A sudden silence.  Sidney is rigid with shock, his words resonant with 
truth.

				SIDNEY
		What?

Even Stu is surprised with his seriousness.

				BILLY
		Think about it. On the off chance I get
		caught-a motive like that could divide a
		jury for years, don't you think?. You took
		my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy 
		factor. Maternal abandonment causes 
		serious deviant behavior. It certainly 
		fucked you up. It made you have sex with 
		a psychopath.

				STU
		That's right and now that you're no 
		longer a virgin. You gotta die--those
		are the rules.

Billy sits the gun down on the table near the foyer.  And then moves to 
Sidney with the butcher knife in hand.

				BILLY
		Pretend this is all just a scary movie,
		Sid. How do you think it's going to end?

Sidney doesn't respond.

				STU
			(excited)
		This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got 
		it all figured out. Why do you think we
		kept your father alive so long? Why did
		we save you for last?

				BILLY
		You know what time it is, Sid? It's 
		after midnight. It's your mother's 
		anniversary. We killed her exactly one
		year ago today.

Billy turns to Stu with the knife.  They eye each other.

				BILLY
		Ready?

				STU
		Yeah...

Billy pulls the knife back and brings it forward quickly, slicing into 
Stu.  He stumbles to ho his knees, WINCING in pain.

				STU
		Jesus...

Sidney SCREAMS...as blood gushes..real blood, a dark, deep red.  Stu 
inspects the wound to his side...then he smiles...

				STU
		Good one. My turn.

He takes the knife from Billy.

				BILLY
		Don't forget-stay to the side and don't
		go too deep.

Stu stabs at Billy's belly, puncturing him...Billy doubles over...

				BILLY
		Jesus...fuck, that hurt.

				SIDNEY
		Stop it!

				BILLY
			(squelching the pain)
		Got the ending figured out yet? Time's
		running out.

				STU
		Come on, Sid. Think about it. Your
		father is the chief suspect. We cloned
		his cellular. The evidence is there.

Billy takes the knife and slashes at Stu's arm, two quick cuts...he 
doubles over...

				BILLY
		What if your father snapped? Your mom's
		anniversary set him off and he went on a
		murder spree, killing everyone...

				STU
			(in major pain)
		Except for me and Billy...we were left 
		for dead...

				BILLY
		And then he killed you and then shoots
		himself in the head. It's a perfect
		ending.

				STU
		Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on
		and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these
		days--you gotta have a sequel.

Stu takes the knife and cuts at Billy.

				SIDNEY
		You sick fucks--you've seen one too many
		movies.

Billy looks at her, bent over, crazed.

				BILLY
		Oh Sid, don't blame the movies...Movies
		don't create psychos. Movies just make
		psychos more creative.

Stu staggers a bit.

				STU
		That's it, Billy. I can't take any more.
		I'm feeling woozy.

				BILLY
		Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.

Billy moves to Sidney's father.

				STU
		Where'd you put it?

Stu is searching the foyer for the gun.

				BILLY
		It's on the table.

				STU
		No, it's not.

Billy hobbles over.  The gun is gone.

				BILLY
		Where the fuck is it?

				VOICE
			(off camera)
		Right here, asshole.

Billy and Stu look up in unison to see...

GALE WEATHERS-CORRESPONDENT FROM INSIDE STORY

standing in the front door way, gun in hand.  Her body tattered and 
bloody.  Her hair a mess.

				BILLY
		I thought she was dead.

				STU
		She looked dead. Still does.

Gale holds the gun firm, in total control.

				GALE
		I've got an ending for you. The reporter
		left for dead in the newsvan comes to,
		stumbles upon you two dipshits, finds the
		gun, fumbles your plan, and saves the day.

Sidney steps forward.

				SIDNEY
		I like that ending.

Billy lunges at Gale, but she holds steady.  Billy and Stu eye each 
other.

				BILLY
		She can't get both of us.

				STU
		Odds are--she'll miss anyway.

In a mad rush, they storm Gale, heading straight at her.  She pulls the 
trigger, but nothing happens...the safety is on.

Billy charges forward, grabbing hold of the front door, SLAMMING IT 
SHUT.  It catches Gale in the face, knocking her backwards out the 
door.  She goes down...out.

				STU
		Cool move.

Billy steps out the front door and retrieves the gun from where Gale 
lays.  Then he turns back inside the house to find...

SIDNEY GONE.

				BILLY
		Where'd she go?

Stu looks around, staggering now, bleeding heavily...Sidney has 
completely disappeared.  Only her father, bound and gagged remains in 
the living.

				STU
		I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.

				BILLY
		Where the fuck did she go?

Suddenly, the phone RINGS.  Billy and Stu look at each other.  
Completely surprised.  Billy scrambles over to the phone.

				BILLY
			(picking up phone)
		Hello?

				SIDNEY
			(from phone)
		Are you alone in the house?

Billy looks to Mr. Prescott.  The cellular phone is gone.

				BILLY
		You bitch--where the fuck are you?

				SIDNEY
		Not so fast.  We're gonna play a little
		game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST
		CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED 
		YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?

Billy looks around the living room.

				BILLY
		Find her.

Billy is fuming now...slightly staggering...and starting to lose it.  
He SCREAMS at Stu who has fallen to his knees.

				BILLY
		FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!

				STU
		I can't...I'm bad off, Billy. You cut
		to deep.

Billy throws the phone at Stu.  He mouths to him, so Sid can't hear.  
"Talk to her..."  Then Billy takes off for the kitchen.  Stu takes the 
phone.

				SIDNEY
			(aware)
		So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got
		one. The police are on their way. What
		are you going to tell them?

				STU
		Peer pressure...I'm way to sensitive.

Billy flies back in the room, grabbing the phone from Stu.  He's 
completely nuts now, staggering, bleeding, totally insane.

				BILLY
			(SCREAMING in phone)
		I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like
		your slut whore mother.

				SIDNEY
		Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed
		Mama's boy.

Billy starts ripping the room up, overturning furniture in a mad fit of 
rage...when he notices the hall closet.  Touche!  He smiles 
deliriously, heading for it, ripping it open as...

A GHOST MASKED FIGURE strikes from within, with an umbrella, the sharp 
end hitting him in the chest as it fans out.  Billy stumbles back, 
stunned, as the GHOST comes at him again...the umbrella lodges in his 
chest, and he goes down.

Sidney rips the GHOST MASK off her head.  She looks at Billy, 
disgusted, throwing the mask on Billy's now still body.  A movement 
behind her sends her reeling around to find...

RANDY slowly sitting up.  His body drenched in blood.  He's 
alive...barely.  He looks to Sidney...through pain...

				RANDY
		You know what I hate most about horror 
		movies? The final scene...it just goes on
		and on...and it gets so stupid...

Randy manages to stand when a FIGURE COMES LEAPING at him, completely 
unexpected...it's Stu...barreling into him...they fall back into the 
living room.  Sidney grabs the gun next to Billy and turns to the 
living room to find...

Randy and Stu rolling across the floor in a dead lock, fighting, both 
seriously injured...Sid tries to find aim when a...

HAND GRABS HOLD of Sidney's ankle, toppling her to the floor...once 
again she finds Billy on top of her...

IN THE LIVING ROOM

Randy and Stu pound at each other, beating and clawing...

ON SIDNEY as she fights viciously, attacking with everything she's 
got...

Randy is desperately trying to pry away from Stu...he grabs hold of the 
television set and tries to pull himself off the floor out of Stu's 
clutch...

His hands find the top of the TV...the VCR...he yanks on it, gripping 
it with his hands, bringing it around with force-CRASHING the VCR into 
Stu's head.  Stu drops.

ON SIDNEY as she digs her hand into Billy's open chest wound.  He CRIES 
OUT BLOODY MURDER.  Her other hand brings the gun up to his face...but 
he head bunts it out the front door...suddenly a flash of silver 
appears above Sidney.

Billy has grasped the butcher knife...he rises it high above Sidney 
ready to strike...when a bullet RIPS THROUGH THE FOYER striking Billy 
knocking him back into the living room.

Sidney looks up to see...

GALE WEATHERS, holding the gun in a death grip as smoke rises above the 
gun's chamber.

Sidney sits up as Gale moves to her, helping her.  Their eyes meet.  A 
life truce.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Billy and Stu lay face up, head to head.  Sid and Gale move over them, 
staring down.  Randy joins them.

				RANDY
		Sid, you found me out...I'm a virgin.
		And pretty happy about it right now.

Sidney nudges their bodies.  They both stir.

				RANDY
		Careful. This is the moment when you
		think the killer's dead, but then he
		springs back to life for one last scare.

Sidney grabs the gun from Gale.

				SIDNEY
		Not this time.

She positions her foot on Stu's chest and aims.

				SIDNEY
		This is for my Mom, asshole.

She SHOOTS him in the forehead, a clean and perfect shot.  The she aims 
the barrel at Billy who's eyes suddenly open, blinking up at her, blood 
bubbling from his lips.  He's not yet dead.  Their eyes lock.

				SIDNEY
		And this Billy stud-bucket is for having
		an incredibly small weenie.

She FIRES another perfect shot.  They're both goners.

Sidney drops the smoking gun, standing silent over the bodies.  A quiet 
moment when suddenly...

A FIGURE LUNGES AT THEM

Both Sid and Gale and Randy SCREAM in epic, final scare proportions as 
Mr. Prescott leaps forward, still bound and gagged.

Sid catches her breath, relaxing.

				SIDNEY
		Oh Daddy...

She rushes to him, untying him...while Gale moves to the bookcase and 
retrieves the hidden camera.

				GALE
		I wanna close-up.

Randy appears by Sidney's side, helping her untie her father.

				RANDY
		This is probably an inappropriate
		moment, but you think you'd want 
		to maybe go out with me sometime...
		like on a date?

Sidney looks at him, dumbfounded.

				RANDY
		Maybe catch a movie?

A long moment as Sidney's face goes from disbelief to resignation to 
the slight trace of a smile.

				SIDNEY
		Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.

				RANDY
		You got it.

He smiles at her...watching as Sidney grabs hold of her father, holding 
him tight as Gale Weathers, with camera in hand, gets one hell of an 
ending to this SCARY MOVIE.



					THE END



SCREAM AGAIN

EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT 
An old preserved movie theatre. The kind only found in a small town. 
Very picturesque. 
The marquee in front reads: 

SNEAK PREVIEW TONIGHT 
"STAB" 
Rated R 

A line has formed around the block, GUYS and GIRLS--mostly college age. 
CLOSE on a girl, 
MAUREEN, no more than 18. A friendly face with innocent eyes. She 
stands in line with her 
boyfriend PHIL, same age. A handsome counterpart. 

MAUREEN 
I hate scary movies. 

PHIL 
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand. 

MAUREEN 
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie. 

PHIL 
We got free tickets. 

He pulls her close, snuggling with her. 

EXT. BOX OFFICE 
Maureen and Phil reach the box office, presenting their tickets. 

They pass through the front doors where an USHER stands randomly 
handing out GHOST MASKS. 
A Hollywood variation of a most familiar one. Phil takes one. 

MAUREEN 
What's that? 

USHER 
The studio sent them. 

INT. THEATRE - A MINUTE LATER 
The small theatre is nearly packed to capacity. Maureen and Phil enter, 
moving down the 
aisle searching for two seats. A YOUNG GIRL SCREAMS, whizzing by them 
as a GHOST MASKED GUY 
chases after her. The crowd LAUGHS. Everyone is having fun.
Maureen and Phil find aisle seats down towards the screen just as the 
lights DIM. 
People FAKE SCREAM in terror. A very lively crowd. 

ON SCREEN 
Credits roll as the movie begins. The studio logo appears followed 
by... 

A ROBERT RODRIGUEZ FILM 

IN THE THEATRE 
Maureen turns to find a GHOST MASK in her face. Phil has slipped it on. 
MAUREEN 
I don't think so. 

Phil gets in her face, playing with her. She swats him. 

MAUREEN 
Take it off. 

PHIL 
But... 

MAUREEN 
Now. 

He obliges. 

ON SCREEN 
More credits. 

BASED ON THE BOOK "THE WOODSBORO MURDERS" BY GALE WEATHERS 

Maureen looks behind her, toward the rest of the audience. A sea of 
white ghost faces fill 
the theatre. The publicity masks actually glow in the dark. A chilling 
sight that leaves 
Maureen extremely spooked. 

ON SCREEN 
The movie begins. A house in the middle of nowhere. Lights burn from 
within. 

Inside the house, a YOUNG GIRL, Alicia Silverstonish is taking a 
shower. The water cascades 
over her nubile body. Suddenly, a FIGURE is glimpsed through the 
curtain. It's all very PSYCHO.

MAUREEN 
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot? 

PHIL 
Sssshhh. 
ON SCREEN 
The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to 
reveal a robe hung on a hook. 
She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing 
the phone. 

GIRL 
Hello? 

A menacing VOICE responds. 

VOICE 
Hello? 

GIRL 
Who is this? 

VOICE 
You tell me. 

IN THE THEATRE 
Maureen is not having a good time. She's already spooked. 

MAUREEN 
I hate this shit. 

ON SCREEN 
The phone rings again. 

VOICE 
Why did you hang up on me? 

GIRL 
Who is this? 

IN THE THEATRE 
Maureen shifts in her seat. 

MAUREEN 
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid.. 

PHIL 
Shush. 

MAUREEN 
I'm gonna pee. You want anything? 

He nods. Maureen stands and moves up the aisle.

INT. LOBBY - SECONDS LATER 
Maureen emerges from the theatre and into the small lobby. It is dark 
and shadowed. 
She moves down a long hallway to a staircase. A BATHROOM sign with an 
arrow points downstairs. 

Maureen hits the stairs to... 

INT. BASEMENT LOUNGE - SAME 
A small lounge leads to two bathroom doors. Very low lighting. Maureen 
descends the stairs, 
heading for the... 

INT. GIRL'S RESTROOM - SAME 
A large bathroom. Five stalls line one wall. The door CREAKS open. 
Maureen enters and shoots 
for a stall. 

INSIDE THE STALL - MOMENTS LATER 
Maureen finishes up, fastening her pants. Suddenly, the bathroom door 
CREAKS open. Maureen 
listens. FOOTSTEPS are heard. Loud and heavy. 

Maureen eyes the crack in the stall door. Not much is visible. 
Suddenly, a SHADOW sweeps by. 
The footsteps stop. 

Maureen finishes up quickly. She flushes, throws the stall door open 
and rushes out to find... 

THE BATHROOM EMPTY. 

The stall doors are all closed. Maureen shoots for the door. She rips 
the door open as a 
FIGURE rushes her... 

A YOUNG GIRL followed by her FRIEND, both perky and loud. They hurl 
past Maureen, LAUGHING and 
carrying on. 

GIRL #l 
I got so scared my bladder rolled. 

GIRL #2 
You chicken shit. It's just a movie. 

GIRL # l 
No, it really happened. It's a true story. 

Maureen is out the door. Now thoroughly spooked. 

INT. BASEMENT LOBBY - SAME 
Alone, Maureen moves for the stairs when a FIGURE emerges from the 
shadows. A GHOST MASKED 
SHAPE appearing behind her... 

LUNGING FOR HER, grabbing her, spinning her around. She SCREAMS MADLY 
as the Ghost starts 
LAUGHING. The mask comes off. It's Phil.

MAUREEN 
You ass. 

PHIL 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy. 

MAUREEN 
You are so not funny. 

Phil takes her in his arms. 

PHIL 
Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya? 

MAUREEN 
I get scared really easy, okay. 

PHIL 
You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay. 

He's sincere. He leans down and plants a kiss on her. She caves, 
kissing him back. Sweet and 
sensual. 

MAUREEN 
I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence. 

PHIL 
(nibbling her neck) We can still Sandra Bullock it. 

MAUREEN
 (nibbling back) Sandra started without us. We can stay.
He kisses her again, then breaks away. 

PHIL. 
Yeah? Okay. I gotta whizz. Meet me upstairs? 

MAUREEN 
Want some popcorn? 

PHIL 
Butter. 

Maureen moves up the stairs out of sight. Phil turns, reaching for the 
bathroom door just 
as a... 

GHOST MASKED FIGURE appears in his path. Phil steps back, surprised. 
Suddenly, a flash of 
silver shoots forth as Phil is pierced with a long sharp knife. Quick 
and silent. He bellies 
over just as the Ghost Shape strikes again. Phil goes down without a 
scream. 

CUT TO: 

INT. LOBBY - SECONDS LATER 
Maureen is at the concession. A GIRL at the counter hands her change 
and Maureen is off with 
soda and a tub of popcorn. 

INT. DARK THEATER - SECONDS LATER 
SCREAMS and GASPS from the audience as the movie plays on. 

ON SCREEN 
A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the 
movie tears off running, 
SCREAMING, flying through the room. 

IN THE THEATER 
The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to the screen. "You 
dumb bitch. Get out of 
the house." etc.

Maureen makes her way back to her aisle seat. She sits down next to... 

PHIL 

who sits with the mask on. The reflection from the movie bouncing 
against it in the darkness. 

MAUREEN 
Give it up. 

She sits down, with the popcorn. 

MAUREEN 
How many stabs did I miss? 

ON SCREEN 
The young girl slips out a side door, completely terrified. In her 
hand, she holds a portable 
phone. 

IN THE THEATER 
Maureen offers Phil popcorn. 

MAUREEN 
Why doesn't she run? 

Phil turns to her, bringing his finger to his masked lips, SSSHHING 
her. 

ON SCREEN 
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER 
stares back. The Figure 
CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting 
away, running... 

IN THE THEATER 
Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach 
herself from the movie. 
She eats her popcorn. 

MAUREEN 
This is so tired. 

She turns her attention to Phil. 

MAUREEN 
Hey, you...pasty face... 

Phil ignores her. She reaches over in the darkness putting her hand on 
his knee. She inches it 
up. The Ghost-masked Phil just stares ahead.

MAUREEN 
Whatsa the matter? Can't I get your ghost?

ON SCREEN 
The young girl is running through the yard. The Ghost Killer is right 
behind her, chasing 
her...she SCREAMS....

IN THE THEATER 
Maureen pretends to watch the movie while her hand continues to move 
between Phil's legs. She 
stares ahead, WINCING at what's about to happen to the girl on screen. 
She doesn't notice as Phil pulls a long sharp hunting knife from inside 
his coat jacket. 
Maureen's hand moves up Phil's jacket...something stops her. She feels 
something on her 
fingers...something wet. She pulls her hand back, the reflected movie 
illuminating bloody 
fingers. 

Maureen stares at her hand... 

ON SCREEN 
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, 
raising high a long, 
hunting knife. The young girl is helpless... 

IN THE THEATER 
Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first 
time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls 
away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other 
one clutching the 
hunting knife. 
Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM 
That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen. 

ON SCREAM 
The young girl is stabbed in the heart. 

IN THE THEATER 
Maureen is helpless. The knife comes fast and furious, striking her in 
the stomach. 
She falls forward, into the aisle as... 

ON SCREEN 
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling 
across wet grass...the 
killer behind her...raising his knife again. 

IN THE THEATER 
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her 
bloody stomach. 
She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for 
all to see, begging for 
help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen 
turns to several 
PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face 
coming at her 
again...knife raised. 

ON SCREEN 
The young girl is slashed again. 

IN THE THEATER 
The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience 
is starting to take 
note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A 
horrifying, 
sickening sight. 

Maureen stumbles forward, her bloody body moving down to the front of 
the theater. Suddenly, 
the entire audience begins... 

APPLAUD AND CHEER 
Maureen, swaying from side to side, 
turns to the crowd and emits a HORRENDOUS BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM as... 

ON SCREEN 
The young girl lets out an enormous EAR SCREECHING SCREAM that mirrors 
Maureen's as the killer 
attacks one last time, stabbing her, silencing her forever. 

IN THE THEATER 
The Ghost slashes out one last time, direct and fierce. Maureen falls 
back against the movie 
screen...very much dead. Her arms flail across the screen...smearing 
blood over the wide screen 
image of the GHOST MASK. 

SMASH CUT TO BLACK. 
SMASH CUT TO BLACK. 

TITLE CARD              "SCREAM 2" 
FADE IN: 

INT. DORM ROOM - MORNING 

A typical college dorm room. Industrial strength furniture. There's two 
of everything.  

A RINGING phone stirs a YOUNG GIRL in bed, asleep under a mound of 
blankets and pillows. 
The girl starts to rise as the phone is answered. A VOICE is heard. 
Brass and sassy. 

VOICE 
(o.c.) Hello...uh-huh... Who is this? Well, we identify ourselves 
around here. No, you can't. 
Uh-huh...yeah, right... 

The girl rolls out of bed, her hair falls away to reveal her face--It's 
SIDNEY PRESCOTT. 
Two years older has brought a maturity to this beautiful young woman. 
Her face posses a 
survivor's edge. Stronger and more determined, she appears to have 
weathered the storm. 

SIDNEY 
I got it. 
She stands and moves to... 

HALLIE 

her roommate and friend. An attractive young black woman. Twenty at 
most. Brazen. Fun. 
Full of life. She hands the phone to Sidney. 

HALLIE 
Knock yourself out. 

SIDNEY 
Hello? 
  (silence) 
Hello? 

VOICE 
Hello Sidney. 

A VOICE spits out of the phone. Deep and haunting. Sidney doesn't 
flinch. 

SIDNEY 
Yes? 

VOICE 
What's your favorite scary movie? 

SIDNEY 
Who is this? 

VOICE 
You tell me. 

Sidney grabs a small device hooked to the phone. She takes a look at 
its display. 

SIDNEY 
Cory Gillis. 442-8730. 
Silence. 

SIDNEY (cont'd) 
Hot flash, Cory--prank phone calls are a criminal offense prosecuted 
under penal code 653M... 

CLICK! The phone goes dead. 

SIDNEY (CONT'D) 
Enjoy the movie. 

She hangs the phone up, turning to Hallie. 

HALLIE 
Time to change numbers again? 

SIDNEY 
Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it 
goes. 

Sidney grabs her robe and shower bucket as Hallie channel surfs. 
Various morning news programs 
are on their small TV. Snippets are heard. 

REPORTER 
(from TV) "..The two victims, Maureen Evans and Phil Stevens..." 

The channel switches. A YOUNG MAN is being interviewed. Attractive, 
sullen. Sad. 

YOUNG MAN (from TV) 
Please, I just wanna be left alone. 

His voice stops Sidney cold. She turns to the television. 

HALLIE 
He sure gives a lot of interviews for someone who wants to be left 
alone. 

Hallie hits the remote. The man's image disappears as the TV goes off. 
Hallie turns, all smiles.

HALLIE 
Get your ass in gear. You're late. Don't forget we've got rush at the 
Deltas tonight. Don't 
wear anything you don't want trashed. Sid? Sid? 

Sidney turns from the television. Momentarily lost. Recovery is 
immediate. 

SIDNEY 
I can't believe I let you talk me into going Greek. 

Sid moves to the door and throws it open. A GHOST FIGURE LEAPS at her. 
She SCREAMS but then 
stops herself. 

It's just a costume hung from her doorframe. Preset, to scare. Another 
prank. Sidney rips it 
down, turns to Hallie, throwing the costume at her. 

SIDNEY 
Pumps. Nice handbag. Whaddya think? 

Sid is surprisingly cool. She exits out the door, leaving Hallie 
staring at the Ghost Mask 
in her hands. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. DORMITORY - MORNING - LITTLE LATER 
Sid steps outside of her dorm. The morning sun shines down as Sid 
breathes in, taking in the 
day just as FIFTY NEWS REPORTERS NOB HER. 

REPORTER #2 
Sidney, did you know the victims? 

REPORTER #1 
Do you feel responsible for the murders? 

SIDNEY 
What murders? 

Microphones are shoved in her face as Sidney is seiged upon by 
journalists and TV cameras. 
She starts to panic. 

REPORTER  #3 
Do you think there will be more murders? 

Sidney is mortified. She pushes and shoves but there is no escape. The 
questions come at  her 
like lightning. She sees a whole in the crowd and goes for it as a 
REPORTER, a 
flashy woman--all hair and teeth, thick sunglasses, moves in her way. 

FLASHY REPORTER 
Did you kill them last night, Sid? Has it gotten to you? Have you 
finally snapped? 

Sidney's eyes flare. Her fist starts to clench when... 
BAM! Someone beats her to it. A fist flies out from the crowd, 
connecting with the flashy 
woman's face. She drops. Sid spins around to find... 

GALE WEATHERS 

standing, tight-fisted. Their eyes meet. A quick moment. Sidney is 
happy to see her. 

The onslaught continues. Cameras flash, reporters shove. Gale moves in 
front of Sid, holding 
the crowd at bay. The reporters begin to throw questions at Gale. 

GALE (to Sid) 
Quick, get outta here. 
SIDNEY 
What's going on? 
GALE 
Just go. l'll find you later. 

Sid wastes no time. She takes off, running around the side of the 
building. She stops, takes a 
breath, but the reporters are on her tail. She looks up to see a... 

SMALL CAMPUS SECURITY VEHICLE 

appear, moving towards her. It slows down. 

MAN'S VOICE (from the vehicle) 
Hop on, Sid.

Sid goes for it as two hands reach out to help her. One smooth move and 
Sidney is in the arms 
of... 

DEWEY RILEY 

She looks at him. Her face a book of questions. 

SIDNEY  
What's going on, Dewey?

He smiles at her. A safe, warm smile. His face as cute as ever. 

DEWEY 
It'll be alright. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. SECURITY CART - MINUTES LATER 
The security cart trots along, passing STUDENTS coming and going. 
Dressed smartly in a campus 
security outfit, Dewey maneuvers the cart across the campus grounds. 
Sidney rides beside him, 
horrified as she listens to him. 

SIDNEY 
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything? 

DEWEY 
They thought it was a publicity stunt. 

SIDNEY 
Oh my God. How could it happen? 

DEWEY 
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the 
victims received anonymous 
passes to the movie. 

SIDNEY 
It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie. 

The cart comes to a stop in front of a building. 

DEWEY 
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. 
The state, Special Task 
Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy. 

SIDNEY 
Yeah, right. 

DEWEY 
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come 
with you. 

SIDNEY 
No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people 
kill people all the 
time. I'll just get used to it. 

Dewey steps down off the security cart and helps Sid off. 

DEWEY 
Nothing will happen to you. I promise. 
Sid's tough demeanor is cracking. She takes a deep breath. 

DEWEY 
That's why I'm here, right? We take care of each other. C'mon, I'll 
walk you to class. 

He starts off, for the first time, a severe limp is visible as his left 
leg drags behind him. 

SIDNEY 
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here. 

DEWEY 
Don't worry... 

SIDNEY 
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, 
knife, a degree in 
defensive combat... 

DEWEY 
Just in case... 

SIDNEY 
No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me 
get back to my quasi 
pseudo-happy existence. 

Sidney reaches up and gives her pseudo-brother a kiss, then takes off 
for the building. 
Dewey watches until she disappears inside, then limps back to his 
security cart. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. STUDENT UNION PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATER 
A newsvan pulls up and parks next to a trough of other newsvans and 
REPORTERS. Some are doing 
live remotes, others ready themselves for the next onslaught. 

Gale gets out of the newsvan, her cellular affixed to her ear. 
 
GALE 
I don't know...no one's talking. What's the studio's position? Never 
happen. They'd be stupid 
to pull the movie. With all this free press--they're gonna have huge 
numbers this weekend. 
It'll break box office records. Of course I have bumps. 

Gale's CAMERAMAN can be seen behind her, in the van fussing with 
equipment.

GALE (cont'd) 
I need two minutes at six o'clock. 
I wanna do a piece on the slain kids--no sympathy shit--let's stick 
with the movie angle. 
I wanna pull a clip from an old film... 

Gale turns to her cameraman, snapping her fingers. 

GALE (cont'd) 
Hey, what was the name of that movie? 

The guy looks up at her. It's RANDY. Two years older but still the 
charming jokester. 

RANDY
HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE. MGN/UA. 1980. Tom Hanks' first film. 

GALE (cont'd) 
(into phone) 
HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE. Yeah, find it. Don't worry, I've got it 
covered...I have a plan. 
Yeah, I'll get it. Give it a rest--I said I'll get it. Later.

She hangs up, turning to Randy. 

GALE (cont'd) 
Pressure's on. You ready for this? 

RANDY 
I'm there, man. No worries. I got ya covered. I'm so there. That's why 
I'm here--because 
I'm there. 

Randy holds up his camera--stoked. 

CUT TO: 

INT. SCHOOL OF FILM - LATER 
Sidney moves down a hallway. Not your typical school building. Through 
open doorways, film 
equipment is glimpsed. Editing bays and the like. She's in the Film 
Department. 
She comes upon an open door and peers in. A large room, a class is in 
progress. 
She slips in quietly. 

INT. CLASSROOM - SAME 
Sidney takes a seat at the back of the room. A handful of FILM STUDENTS 
sit around on torn 
couches heavy in discussion. Sid goes unnoticed as she watches a 
whirlwind debate. 
A SNOTTY GUY is pontificating a point. 

SNOTTY GUY 
Sequels are too handicapped. By definition alone, they're inferior 
films. 

Hallie sits on a couch next to MICKEY, 20's, atheletic, cool and rowdy. 
Arms enwrapped. 

MICKEY 
Bullshit generalization. Many sequels have surpassed their original. 

SNOTTY GUY 
Name one. 

MICKEY 
ALIENS Far better than the original. 

ANOTHER GUY 
Subjective. 

SOME GIRL 
Life's subjective. I much prefer Ridley Scott. 

The conversation overlaps, everyone arguing..making their point about 
ALIENS VS. ALIEN. 

HALLIE 
No way. ALIENS rocked. "Stay away from her--you bitch." 

SNOTTY GUY 
I'll give you that one. Name another. 

MICKEY 
T2. 

SOME GIRL 
You've got a hard-on for Cameron. 

SNOTTY GUY 
A bigger budget does not make a better movie. TERMINATOR one is 
historical. 

Someone screams out, "You Sarah Connor?" as the TEACHER, a young artsy 
type, speaks up. 

ARTSY TEACHER 
How about THE GODFATHER PART II? 

Ooooohhh. The whole room goes worship silent. All in agreement. 

SNOTTY GUY 
The almighty exception. Name another. 

A YOUNG MAN, handsome and smooth, jumps into the conversation. His name 
is Derek. 

DEREK 
EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Smarter story. Improved effects. 

From the back of the room, Sidney watches him. Fixated. 

HALLIE 
I liked JEDI. With the furry things. 

Everyone BOO'S. "Ewoks blow." 

MICKEY 
Lucas and his Romper Room stage. 

HALLIE 
I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20. 

SNOTTY GUY 
Case in point. The entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels. 

ARTSY TEACHER 
Really? And why do you think that is? 

SNOTTY GUY 
Sequels suck. Hello. It becomes about: money and no one's interested in 
quality.

DEREK 
It's more than that. Horror films are only as good as their villains. 
How can Freddie and Jason possibly be scary after they've been diluted 
through five or six 
sequels. 

TEACHER 
What's the solution? If you were making a sequel today what would you 
do differently? 

The class stews on this. Derek turns, spotting Sidney in the back of 
the room. She gives a 
half wave. He starts for her, excusing himself. 

SNOTTY GUY 
The point is - I made my point. Sequels suck. 

INT. CORRIDOR - SAME 
Derek and Sidney move out into the hallway. Derek throws his arms 
around her protectively. 

DEREK 
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard... 

SIDNEY 
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks. 

DEREK 
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'? 

SIDNEY 
Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo. 

He looks at her with bedroom eyes. 

DEREK 
I can do that. And I can also do this. 

He moves on her, wrapping her in his arms and kissing her passionately. 
She breaks away, laughing. 

SIDNEY 
No PDA.

But it's a failed objection. He kisses her again and they're soon 
devouring each other like 
two people in love. Right in the middle of the hallway.

CUT TO: 

EXT. STUDENT UNION - LATE AFTERNOON 
The place is a circus. The front steps of the student center have been 
roped off to form a 
platform. A podium and mike have been placed center. 

CROWDS have gathered for the press conference that is being held by the 
university. 
Reporters and cameras have been roped off to the side. On stage, DEAN 
FISHER, a sharp looking 
woman in her forties is talking to spectators. 

DEAN FISHER 
(reading from a prepared statement) "..and we feel this unfortunate 
isolated tragedy in no way 
reflects upon our fine school and we should trust that the authorities 
and FBI are acting 
quickly to bring us answers..." 

Beside her stand uniformed COPS, the local SHERIFF, FBI AGENTS. She 
continues on... 

IN THE ROPED OFF NEWS SECTION 
Gale walks through the crowd, listening to the Dean. 

FEMALE VOICE 
(o.c.) Gale? Can I have a second? 

Gale spins around to find DEBBIE SALT, the flashy reporter who she 
decked earlier, standing 
in front of her. 

GALE 
Look, I'm sorry about the face. 

DEBBIE SALT 
Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions? 

GALE 
Fair enough. 

DEBBIE SALT 
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field 
reporting? 

The woman has immediately put Gale on the defensive. TWO OTHER 
REPORTERS have taken notice. 
Suddenly, CAMERAS are on Gale. 
GALE 
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter. 

DEBBIE SALT 
And much richer as a result. 

GALE 
Do I know you? You look familiar. 

DEBBIE SALT 
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year. 

GALE 
Good for you. 

And in seconds the vultures are upon her as Gale Weathers is beseiged 
by REPORTERS. 
The questions spew forth. "Why are you here?" "Is this the work of a 
copycat killer?" 
"Have you talked to Sidney?" etc. 

GALE 
(ever smooth) Guys, you're missing the show. 

And with that Gale wanders off into the crowd. 

ON STAGE 
The LOCAL SHERIFF, a smart looking guy in his 50's is fielding 
questions. 

SHERIFF 
No, we have no evidence of a serial killer. We think the killer acted 
deliberately 
and not at random... 

ON THE LAWN 
Students and concerned faculty stand. Among them are Sidney, Derek, 
Hallie and Mickey. 
Next to them stand JOEL, 20's, black, sensible and friendly. A very 
intelligent face. 

DEREK 
But what are they doing? He's talking but he's not saying anything. 

JOEL 
Sounds like they don't know anything. 

HALLIE 
Do you think they'll cancel Hell Week? 

MICKEY 
You're getting nailed - you're not getting out of it. 

From across the way, two gorgeous sorority type girls, LOIS and MURPHY 
stand with their 
FRATERNITY JOCK BOYFRIENDS. All looks and attitude. Their eyes are on 
Sidney as they huddle 
in a conspiratory stance. 

JOEL 
Have they questioned you yet, Sid? 

SIDNEY 
This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial 
killers currently active 
in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry? 

HALLIE 
I have rehearsal. 

MICKEY 
I have to watch rehearsal. 

Hallie kicks him. Joel moves to Sid. 

JOEL 
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You 
gonna be okay, Sid? 

SIDNEY 
You're not allowed to ask that. 

JOEL 
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight. 

SIDNEY 
Thanks, Joel.

Joel smiles, heading out as the two sorority girls, Lois and Murphy 
saunter over. 

LOIS 
Hello, pledges. Enjoying yourselves? 

Instantly, Hallie stands at attention. Sidney joins begrudgingly. 

HALLIE
Yes, sister Lois. Very much so. Thank you for asking. 

MURPHY 
Good. We need your help, pledges. Are you familiar with the Deltas TP 
fundraiser? 

The pledges shake their heads. Suspicious. Lois withdraws two rolls of 
toilet paper from her 
book bag and passes them out. 

LOIS (cont'd) 
In our efforts to raise money for our favorite cause... 

MURPHY 
..this week's TKE kegger... 

LOIS 
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere 
nickel a piece. 

MURPHY 
We've set you each at a five dollar quota. 

MICKEY 
Come on, guys. Uncool. 

MURPHY 
Am I getting fraternity interference, Mickey? 

SIDNEY 
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper. 

DEREK 
Sid, you don't have to.

Sidney takes her toilet paper. 

SIDNEY 
No special treatment. I can do this. C'mon Hallie. 

She throws him a comforting glance. She's okay with this. She heads off 
with Hallie. 
Derek watches. 

DEREK 
How do you put up with this Greek shit? 

MICKEY 
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie... 

ACROSS THE WAY 
Gale moves through the crowd as the press conference/rally continues. 
She runs dead smack into... 

DEWEY 

Their eyes meet. A long moment. The silence between them is revealing.

GALE 
Hello, Dwight. 

DEWEY 
Miss Weathers. 

GALE 
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned... 

DEWEY 
I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me. 

He tips his hat curtly, then starts off. She stops him. 

GALE 
The name's Gale, remember'? 

He turns on her. His eyes on fire. 

DEWEY 
Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears. 

GALE 
I see you read the book. 

DEWEY 
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock. 

GALE 
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question. 

DEWEY 
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney 
Fifish presence." 
I think you've explained yourself. 

GALE 
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry. 

DEWEY 
No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me 
for saying-- mediocre 
writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be. 

This stings Gale. 

GALE 
You have every right to be upset. 

DEWEY 
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience." 

GALE 
I never meant to imply... 

DEWEY 
How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form 
of manipulation used to 
lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively 
maneuver within any 
given situation? 

Gale is at a loss. 

GALE 
I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry. 

DEWEY 
No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, 
I have some oozing to do. 

Dewey turns and limps away, leaving Gale staring after him. Her face 
smashed fiat. 

ON STAGE 
The sheriff continues fielding questions from reporters. 

SHERIFF 
No, there has been no evidence that more than one killer is 
responsible... 

ACROSS THE WAY 
Sidney and Hallie have split up. They move through the crowd selling 
toilet paper. 
Several STUDENTS make their purchase. Sidney pockets her change, looks 
up to see Gale, 
standing alone. She goes to her. 

SIDNEY 
Hello, Gale. 

GALE 
Sidney. Hello. How are you? 

SIDNEY 
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that... 

GALE 
I'm sorry. 

SIDNEY 
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should 
hate you... 
I see your movie's getting good reviews. 

GALE 
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper? 

SIDNEY 
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas. 

GALE 
It's good to see you involved. 

SIDNEY 
My morn was a Delta. 

BEAT. People have begun to notice the two of them talking. Reporters 
and spectators have 
slowly circled them. Gale looks around. She spots Randy, who appears 
behind Sid, with his 
camera. Gale gives him the nod. He throws the camera up, hits the 
light. 

Sid spins around, surprised to see him. 

SIDNEY (cont'd) 
Randy? What are you doing here? 

But then she sees someone else, standing off to the side. A man she 
recognizes immediately. 
He looks at; her, his face sullen, broken. Sidney loses her breath. 

SIDNEY (cont'd) 
Cotton... 

He moves to her.

COTTON 
Hello, Sidney. 

Gale motions to Randy. He maneuvers, getting the two of them in frame. 
A long moment, Sidney just stares at him. Completely off guard. She 
looks to Randy who 
aims the camera directly at her...filming her. 

SIDNEY  
What are you doing? 

She turns back to Gale, staring holes through her, realizing she's been 
set up. She looks 
back to Cotton. She doesn't know what to say. She turns back to Gale. 
Eyes aflame. 

SIDNEY  (cont'd) 
You BITCH! 

Sidney storms off, disappearing in the crowd. Cotton turns to Gale. His 
face pained. 

COTTON 
This was a mistake. I shouldn't be here. 

He takes off, pushing through the crowd. Randy stops filming. 

RANDY 
Can you say backfire?

GALE 
Did you get it? 

RANDY 
Yeah, I got it. 

Randy is clearly not happy about his part in this. It's in his voice. 

GALE 
You need to check your conscience at the door. We're not here to be 
loved. 

Randy's face reveals otherwise. 

AT THE PODIUM 
The sheriff continues. 

SHERIFF  
No, we don't anticipate another murder but we are taking every 
precaution possible... CUT TO: 

EXT. SORORITY ROW - NIGHT 
A small street that dead-ends in a cul de sac. Large old homes populate 
it. Greek signs 
adorn the place. Welcome to Sorority Row. 

INT. SORORITY HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
A huge living room. Divided sensibly in several sections. Nicely done. 
Et is empty except 
for one girl who lies on the couch watching television. This is CICI, 
pretty with a lively 
energy about her. She channel surfs while talking on the phone. 

CICI 
(on phone) No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and 
Sarah can't take it anymore. 

GIRL ON PHONE 
(from phone) thought he was doing AA. 

CICI 
No, he quit - the whole God thing--he has issues. The previews for next 
week... 

BEEP! BEEP! Call waiting bleeps through. 

CICI (cont'd) 
Hold up...someone's calling. (she clicks over) Chi Omega House. 

MAN'S VOICE 
Hello. 

A MAN'S VOICE. Deep and alluring. 

CICI  
Yes. 

MAN'S VOICE 
Who is this? 

CICI  
Cici. Who's this? 

MAN'S VOICE 
Someone who wants to talk to you.  

CICI 
Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on. 

She clicks back over. 

CICI (cont'd) 
Teddy's on the other line. He sounds drunk. I'll call you back. 

GIRL ON PHONE 
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there. 

CICI 
I won't. 

GIRL ON PHONE 
Don't. Think Bailey. 

CICI 
Alright, alright...I'll call you back. 

She clicks back over. 

CICI (cont'd) 
Okay, Ted, you sound loaded. What's up? 

MAN'S VOICE 
Who's Ted? 

Realizing, it's not Ted. 

CICI 
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else. 

MAN'S VOICE 
That's okay. 

CICI 
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here. 

MAN'S VOICE 
Where is everybody? 

CICI 
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight. 

MAN'S VOICE 
Why aren't you there? 

CICI  
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and 
needs a ride. 

MAN'S VOICE 
That's too bad. 

CICI  
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for? 

MAN'S VOICE 
What if I said you? 

CICI  
What if I said goodbye? 

MAN'S VOICE 
Why would you wanna do that? 

CICI  
Why do you always answer a question with a question? 

MAN'S VOICE 
I'm inquisitive. 

CICI  
I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone? 

Silence. No response. 

CICI  (cont'd) 
Hello? Hello? Where'd you go? 

Silence again. And then... 

MAN'S VOICE 
Do you wanna die tonight, Cici ? 

Almost a whisper. Simple. Direct. His voice pierces Cici. Her eyes 
widen. BEEP! 
Call waiting CLICKS through. 

CICI  
Just a second. 
(clicks over) 
Yes? 

Cici gets up and moves to...

INT. FOYER - SAME 
Cici checks the front door, making sure it's locked. 

GIRL ON PHONE 
Was it Teddy? 

CICI 
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me. 

GIRL ON PHONE 
It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. 
It's nothing. 

BUMP! A noise from upstairs. Cici spins around to the staircase. 

CICI 
Shit. 

GIRL ON PHONE 
What is it? 

CICI  
I heard a noise. 

GIRL ON PHONE  
Where? 

CICi 
Upstairs. 

BUMP! Something moves upstairs. It sounds almost like footsteps. 

CICI 
Shit. Cici moves to the staircase. She peers up it. 

CICI  (cont'd) 
(calling out) 
Hello? Hello? 

GIRL ON PHONE 
(ala Friday the 13th) Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah... 

CICI  
Stop it...

GIRL ON PHONE 
I can't believe you're alone in that house. 

Cici looks up the staircase again. 

CICI 
(soft whisper) I don't think I'm alone. 

Floorboards CREAK above her. Cici freaks. 

CICI 
I'm outta here. 

She flies to the door, unlocking it, throwing it open. She moves out 
onto the... 

EXT. FRONT PORCH - SAME 
A wooden porch with a bulb glowing overhead. She stands on the porch 
steps, looking back, 
through the open door, into the house. The phone starts to CRACKLE. 

GIRL ON PHONE 
You're breaking up. Where are you? 

CICI  
Outside. 

GIRL ON PHONE 
That's smart. 

Cici looks up and down the street. A YOUNG GUY walks along the 
sidewalk. 

CICI 
(calling out to him) Hey, you? HELLO? HELL0? 

The guy wears a headset, his head bobbing to the beat. He doesn't see 
her. Cici looks up the 
street to a sorority house down the block. Lights burn from within. 
People come and go. 

CICI (cont'd) 
There's something going on at the Delta Zeta's. I'm gonna walk down. 

Cici moves further down the porch steps. The phone begins to CRACK 
severely. 

GIRL ON PHONE 
(phone begins to go out) Don't do that. Hang up...call...(static) 

CICI 
What? I can't hear you... 

GIRL ON PHONE 
(major static) 
Hang up...call... 

CICI 
I'm losing you. 

GIRL ON PHONE 
...campus security...send someone...check out...place... 

CICI 
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back. 

Cici hangs up the phone. She hits the TALK button. Nothing but static. 
She tries again. 
She can't get a dial tone. She looks back to the front door. She 
hesitates quickly, debating, 
then she moves back up the porch steps. 

She tries the phone again. It still won't connect. She moves back to 
the front porch. It 
connects. Major static. She dials 511. 

VOICE 
(major static) 
Campus Security. 

CICI 
Hello, I'm calling from the Chi Omega... 

VOICE 
(too much static) I'm sorry. I can't hear you. Hello? 

Cici eyes the open front door. She inches back to it. 

CICA (CONT'D) 
Can you hear me now? 

VOICE 
We...bad..connec...call back. 

The phone goes dead.

CICI 
Shit. 

Cici redials. The same static.
 
VOICE 
Hello? 

CICI 
I'm calling... 

VOICE 
I can't hear you. 

Cici peers through the front door, into the house. It's completely 
empty. Cici steps back 
inside the house. The connection becomes much clearer. 

CICI 
I'm calling from the Chi Omega house. Someone is harassing me. Hello? 

There's no one on the line. 

CICI (cont'd) 
Shit! 

SUDDENLY, A FIGURE APPEARS BEHIND HER. A HAND
GRABS HER. 

Cici spins around, SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER. 

GIRL'S VOICE 
Did the phone ring? 

Standing before her is DAWNIE, a young girl, sweet, pre- occupied. 

CICI 
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here? 

DAWNIE 
I live here. 

CICI 
I thought you were going to the mixer? 

DAWNIE 
I had to change. Did anyone call? 

CICI 
Just some asshole trying to scare me.

The front door remains wide open. The phone RINGS. Cici stares at it in 
her hand. 
She doesn't answer it. 

DAWNIE  
Are you okay? 

Cici nods, answering the phone. ROCK MUSIC BLARES from the receiver. 

CICI 
Hello? 

DRUNK GIRL (from phone) We need a ride. Taxi!  Taxi! 
CICI  Where are you? 

DRUNK GIRL 
(from phone) We're at Grogs and need a ride to Acid Rain. 

DAWNIE 
Who is it? Is it Tina? 

CICI 
They're at Grogs. 

Dawnie grabs the phone, moving into the living room. She moves to a 
mirror and fusses with 
her hair. 

DAWNIE  
Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm  on my way. 
Cici follows her back into the living room. 

CICI 
I'll go. I don't mind. Really. 

Dawnie hangs up the phone, turning to Cici. 

DAWNIE 
Take the next one. You should set the alarm. There's a killer on the 
loose. 

Reflected through the mirror is the foyer. Neither see as a SHROUDED 
FIGURE appears through 
the front door. Dawnie turns back to the mirror just as the FIGURE 
sweeps into the dark 
dining room and out of sight. 

Dawnie starts back for the front door. The phone RINGS. 
Dawnie grabs it. 

DAWNIE (cont'd) 
Hello? 

MAN'S VOICE 
Is Cici there? 

DAWNIE 
Who's calling? 

MAN'S VOICE 
Ted? 

Dawnie throws her the phone and races out the door. 

DAWNIE (cont'd) 
It's your ill-concieved boyfriend. Seeya later. Set the alarm. 

She SLAMS the door shut behind her. A second later we hear it lock. 
Dawnie brings the 
phone up to her ear. 

CICI 
Hello? Ted? 

MAN'S VOICE 
No, it's me. 

Cici nearly collapses. She's starting to lose it. 

CICI 
WHAAAATT? 

MAN'S VOICE 
Don't forget to set the alarm. 

Cici hangs up, throwing the phone across the room. She moves back to 
the foyer where an alarm 
panel is positioned in the wail. She hits a coupla digits and a BEEP is 
heard as she activates 
the alarm. 

She checks the door, making sure it's locked, then she turns and moves 
into the... 

DARK DINING ROOM 
Cici finds the light switch. CLICK! The room is illuminated. Two long 
dining tables run the 
length of the room. It's empty. Void of the FIGURE. 

INT. KITCHEN - SAME 
A large, dark kitchen. Cici moves to the frig and opens it, She gives 
it the once over. The 
frig light reflects against her face. She closes the refrigerator, not 
seeing the SHADOW that 
bounces across her back. 

Cici moves to a sliding glass door that overlooks the backyard. She 
checks the lock. Secure. 
Then, the phone RINGS. 

She turns to the phone that's attached to a nearby wall. It RINGS 
AGAIN. She reaches for it, 
answering it. 

CICI 
Hello? 

SUDDENLY, TWO HANDS LUNGE OUT OF THE DARKNESS 
One finds her neck, the other grabs her by the hair, wrenching her head 
backwards and 
spinning her around, shoving her, pushing her into the... 

SLIDING GLASS DOOR 

Glass explodes everywhere, shattering to bits as Cici's body crashes 
through it, setting off 
the ALARM A loud, shrill RING resonants through the house as Cici's 
body lands on the deck 
outside. Still. (NOTE: WES DOES REALLY SCARY SHIT HERE.)
 
CUT TO: 

EXT. DELTA ZETA HOUSE - MINUTES LATER 
Two doors down from Chi Omega. A big, old Gothic home serves as the 
Delta Zeta sorority. 
MUSIC PLAYS from inside. It sounds like a party. 

ENT. DELTA ZETA LIVING ROOM - SANE 
The room is filled with fifteen to twenty people. SORORITY GIRLS and 
FRAT BOYS who SCREAM 
and CHEER as they watch four girls who sit on their knees, hands behind 
their back, in front 
of a coffee table devouring plates of macaroni and cheese topped with 
whipped cream. 

Sidney, Hallie, and two other girls, TERI and LUCE tear into the 
macaroni with all their 
might. Gobbling it up, making a mess of themselves. Mickey is next to 
Hallie, coaching her on. 
ON Sid as she finishes her plate. 

A whistle BLOWS.

MURPHY (cont'd) 
Looks like we have a winner. 

Sid sits up. Macaroni and whipped cream is all over her face. 
She smiles the victor. Everyone APPLAUDS. 

MURPHY (cont'd) 
Sidney gets to skip the next round of Bulimia bingo. 

Hallie, a face full of grime, eyes Sid. 

HALLIE 
You bitch. 

They crack up. Someone passes her a towel. She stands wiping her face, 
looking across the 
room as Derek enters through the front door. She waves at, him. He 
hurries over. 

SIDNEY 
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni 
sundae binge. 

DEREK 
I'm sorry honey. I got behind. 

ON HALLIE AND MICKEY  
Mickey is cleaning off Hallie's face. 

MICKEY
I don't want you to choke or anything but you're trailing. You need to 
pick the pace up. 

She swats him. 

ON SID AND DEREK 
Sid and Derek stand arm in arm watching the next round. 

SIDNEY 
(complete throw away) Any news? 

DEREK 
About what? 

SIDNEY 
The forbidden subject. 

He shakes his head.

Suddenly, a FRAT BOY pops into the room. 

FRAT BOY 
Yo, guys, outside. Something's up at the Chi Omega. Police are 
everywhere. 

People begin to stand, moving to the windows and front door. Sidney 
looks to Derek. 

EXT. DELTA ZETA HOUSE - SAME 
Everyone comes flying out of the front door and into the yard as POLICE 
CARS WHIP BY. 
SIRENS BLARING. 

ANGLE ON STREET 
Two doors down sits the Chi Omega house crawling with police, 
ambulances, reporters... 

"Yo--let's check it out." "C'mon." The entire crowd takes off in droves 
down the street. 
All except for... 

SIDNEY AND DEREK 

They stand on the porch, watching as the street becomes a circus. CLOSE 
ON SIDNEY'S FACE. 
She knows. 

INT. CHI OMEGA  HOUSE - SAME 
Captain Tyler, the Sheriff, police, FBI... the house is crawling. 
Dewey sifts around on his own, checking things out. 

IN THE KITCHEN  
Captain Tyler and the Sheriff stand at the shattered glass door. 

SHERIFF 
Lots of blood. But no body. 

CAPTAIN TYLER 
Have you checked the... 

SHERIFF 
Attic, garage, basement, nothing. 

CAPTAIN TYLER 
Take the neighborhood. 

The Sheriff turns to his men. 

SHERIFF 
Alright men, listen up... 

Dewey is all ears. 

INT. DELTA ZETA HOUSE - SAME 
Derek and Sid stand on the porch, his arms around her. Her face is 
numb. 

SIDNEY 
It's starting all over again. 

DEREK 
Lemme take you home. 

SIDNEY 
I'll get my jacket. 

Sidney, indifferent, moves through the open front door, back inside the 
house. 
Her face and mind detached from what's going on. Derek remains on the 
porch, watching the 
spectacle. Slowly, the door behind him closes. 

INT. DELTA ZETA LIVING ROOM - SANE 
Sid moves through the living room, she grabs her coat when the phone 
RINGS. She looks at it 
suspiciously...knowingly...she reaches for it. 

SIDNEY 
Hello? 

MAN'S VOICE 
Hello Sidney? 

The VOICE. Low and haunting. Sidney closes her eyes. When she opens 
them tears are immediate 
But still, she refuses to crack. 

SIDNEY 
Who are you? 

MAN'S VOICE 
Soon, Sidney, soon. 

SIDNEY 
What do you want? 

MAN'S VOICE 
To see every ounce of blood drain from your body.

The Voice has never sounded more evil...more seductive. Sidney doesn't 
flinch. 
She holds steady. 

SIDNEY 
Then come and get me. 

And with that Sidney hangs up the phone, SLAMMING it down.  Silence. 
And then... 
 
MAN'S VOICE 
My pleasure. 

The Voice comes from inside the room...behind her. Sidney spins around 
and finds herself 
staring at the... 

GHOST MASKED FIGURE

But not the one from the movie theater. The one from Sidney's nightmare 
long ago. It stands 
in the foyer archway, staring at her. 

A sustained moment. A stand off. Sidney doesn't move. But then the 
killer withdraws his 
trademark. A long, steel hunting knife...blood stained. 

SIDNEY BOLTS 

as the GHOST LEAPS at her. She SCREAMS, dodging him, 

ON THE PORCH 
Derek hears her SCREAM. He turns to the front door. He finds it locked. 
He starts to BEAT on it. 

DEREK 
Sid? Sid? 

IN THE LIVING ROOM 
Sid just dodges the Ghost, just missing the knife's blade. She bolts 
through the living room, 
to the front door. Derek beats on it from outside. 

IN THE FOYER 

SIDNEY 
Derek. He's in the house. Help...me... 

She struggles with the door, there are too many locks, the Ghost is 
already upon her. She 
looks to the stairs, thinks better of it...flies through the dining 
room.

INT. FRONT PORCH - SANE 
Derek is going nuts trying to get into the house. He moves along the 
porch to the windows, 
looking through. He watches as the Ghost Figure chases her into the 
kitchen. Derek looks 
about the porch. He rears his foot back and kicks in the window. 

INT. KITCHEN - SAME 
Sid moves through the kitchen to the back door. She struggles with the 
lock as the Ghost is 
right behind her. She barely makes it out the back door... 

EXT. BACK YARD - SAME 
A large, fenced in yard. Lots of big oak trees. Sid flies down the back 
porch and into the 
yard. She moves across it, passed trees and shrubs. She spots a closed 
fence door in the back 
of the yard. She looks behind her to find... 

NOTHING 

She scans the yard, the Ghost Figure has completely disappeared. She 
moves behind a big tree, 
hiding behind it. Sid stops, catches her breath, then peers from behind 
the tree. The yard is 
completely empty. She goes for the fence door, slowly moving around the 
tree. 

BUMP! A noise in the darkness. She spins around, still making her way 
around the tree, moving 
backwards, walking right into a FIGURE. She SCREAMS, spinning around, 
finding herself face to 
face with... 

CICI'S BODY 

hanging, dangling, hung from the tree, her stomach a ripped, bloody 
mess. Sidney SCREAMS IN 
UNFORGETTABLE HORROR. She steps back, falling right into the arms of... 

DEWEY 

She turns, SCREAMING. 

DEWEY
It's okay. It's okay. It's just me. 

He takes her into his arms, comforting her, as she holds on for dear 
life.

EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - MORNING 
The early sun casts light upon an otherwise dark and joyless morning as 
the blood stained 
campus slowly comes to life. 

EXT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - MORNING 
The local campus security office has been converted into a media event. 
News trucks, cameras 
and REPORTERS stand guard outside while inside... 

INT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - MORNING 
The place is packed. No longer just a campus security office. The place 
has been converted to 
the local police station as well as FBI headquarters. UNIFORMS and 
SUITS swarm the place. 

In a back section of the room, Sheriff Hartley and Captain Tyler are in 
a huge discussion 
with Dean Fisher. Tempers are heated. Its been a sleepless night for 
all. 

CAPTAIN TYLER 
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the 
victims. 

SHERIFF 
The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was 
gutted with 
autopsy precision. 

DEAN FISHER 
Christ! Just do something. I will not have a repeat of Gainesville. Not 
on my campus.. 

Dewey listens to this exchange, slowly stepping forward. 

DEWEY 
Sidney Prescott, sir. 

They both turn to him. 

DEWEY (cont'd) 
She's the connection. 

CAPTAIN TYLER 
We know that, son. 

DEWEY 
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a 
distraction. 

CAPTAIN TYLER 
We're aware of that. 

Sheriff Hartley steps forward. 

DEWEY 
The killer is obviously repeating Woodsboro. I can fill you in on what 
I know. 

Dewey is not a welcome participant. Eyes roll. Captain Tyler pulls 
Dewey aside. 

CAPTAIN TYLER  
Look, son. I know you've lived through this, but we got it under 
control. Why don't you 
have some coffee? 

Just then, Gale Weathers appears being ushered in by TWO UNIFORMS. Dean 
Fisher greets her 
with smiles The FBI and local police fawn over her. 

SHERIFF 
Thank you, Miss Weathers for coming in. 

GALE 
Of course, what can I do? 

Captain Tyler gives Dewey a patronizing pat on the back, sending him 
off. 

CAPTAIN TYLER 
We were hoping you could help with the killer's profile. 

Dewey's face couldn't be more burned. 

INT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - MORNING - MINUTES LATER 
A chalk board in front of them. Three names are written on it under the 
label "Victims" --MAUREEN EVANS, PHIL STEVENS, CICI TAYLOR. 
Gale is at the chalk board 

GALE 
Maureen Evans--Maureen Prescott. Sidney Prescott's mother. The first 
victim in the 
Woodsboro Murders. Phil Stevens-- Stephen Orth--the first kid to be 
murdered. 
Ten to one--Cici is not the third victim's real name. 

SHERIFF 
It's Cassandra. 

GALE 
Nickname Cassie or--Casey. The third victim in Woodsboro. She was hung 
from a tree and gutted. 

The room goes quiet. Dewey watches from the back of the room. His eyes 
burning holes into Gale. 

CAPTAIN TYLER 
Jesus... 

GALE 
This is a complete copycat. Your killer is even going in sequence. 

Captain Tyler sits up. 

CAPTAIN TYLER 
Who was the next victim in Woodsboro? 

GALE 
In the book or in the movie? 

DEAN FISHER 
Let's try reality. 

GALE 
Mr. Himbry--the principal was the next victim. However, in the movie 
version, Tatum Riley 
was killed next. Dramatic license. 

SHERIFF 
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action. 

CAPTAIN TYLER 
(to his men) Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other 
name... 

DEWEY 
Tatum Riley. 

Dewey speaks up. His voice soft but heard. The entire room stares at 
him, knowingly. Gale's 
eyes find his. He looks away. 

CAPTAIN TYLER 
Both on campus and the surrounding community. I want names ASAP. 

DEAN FISHER 
I'll get you full access. 

The room breaks into a fury as they jump into action. Gale stops 
Captain Tyler. 

GALE 
What about Sidney? Is she safe? 

CAPTAIN TYLER 
She's completely insulated. I've got my top men on her. 

CUT TO: 

INT. SIDNEY ' S DORM ROOM - MORNING 
Sid, Derek, Hallie, Mickey, and Joel lounge among pillows and blankets. 
The remains of a 
sleepover. Joel parts the blinds. 

ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW 
Two plains clothed policemen are in view, milling about outside--
standing guard. 

JOEL 
How many guys they have on you? 

MICKEY 
I counted four. 

Hallie reads from a notebook in her hand. 

HALLIE
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas? 

SIDNEY 
Please, I have the perfect excuse. 

HALLIE 
What about rehearsal? 

SIDNEY 
Gotta. 

HALLIE 
I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu-
drama? 

DEREK 
Two. 

HALLIE 
So you'll relieve me at 2:30... 

DEREK 
And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit. 

JOEL 
Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite. 

SIDNEY 
Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way. 

HALLIE 
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening. 

MICKEY 
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight. 

HALLIE 
Too bad. 

SIDNEY 
This is exactly what I don't want. 

DEREK 
I think it's out of your control. 

Derek puts his arms around her, pulling her close. Mickey and Hallie 
argue about this evening. 
Joel moves out the door. 

JOEL 
Sid, I'll seeya tonight. 

SIDNEY 
But... 

Derek kisses her sweetly. 

SIDNEY 
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends. 

DEREK 
Let us decide that. 

SIDNEY 
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it? 

DEREK  
It's under control. 

He kisses her again. 

CUT TO: 

INT. STUDENT UNION - LATER 
A huge one-stop for students. Comprised of several open floors, it 
looks like a mini-mall. 
A cafeteria, book store, movie theatre, arcade, etc. fill the place. 

Gale moves through the lobby area when she sees Debbie Salt heading her 
off. She tries to bolt 
but she's not fast enough. 

DEBBIE SALT 
Hi, Gale, any leads? 

GALE 
Tons and tons. 

DEBBIE SALT 
Where is Sidney's father? 

GALE  
Home--where he lives. 

DEBBIE SALT 
And are the police sure about that? 

GALE 
Why don't you ask them? 

DEBBIE SALT 
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think? 

GALE 
No, I don't. 

DEBBIE SALT 
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.

GALE 
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives 
you some anal 
charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the 
scoop anymore. Excuse me. 

Gale charges off, moving to a nearby newsstand. The tabloid papers 
exploit what's going on. 
Crazy headlines about the murders dominate the newsrack. 

Gale is clearly bothered by this. Just then, a phone RINGS. She pulls 
it from her pocket. 

GALE (cont'd) 
Hello? 

MAN'S VOICE 
Hello, Gale. 

It's the Killer. His voice is unmistakable. 

GALE 
Who is this? 

MAN'S VOICE 
I'll give you one guess. 

Gale knows immediately. She looks around for help. A CAMPUS COP is 
across the lobby. 

GALE 
Who are you? 

MAN'S VOICE 
That's not the way we play the game. 

GALE 
I don't play games. 

MAN'S VOICE 
What if your life depended on it? 

Gale gets testy with him. 

GALE 
What do you want? 

MAN'S VOICE  
You're pretty when you're angry. 

Gale stops cold. She looks around. The place is alive with people. He 
could be anywhere. 

GALE 
Where are you? 

MAN'S VOICE 
I'm everywhere. 

She continues moving to the CAMPUS COP. 

GALE 
Oh--a God complex 

MAN'S VOICE  
Stay away from the cop. 

A deadly warning. Gale stops. She plays it cool. She looks above her to 
the upper floor. 
STUDENTS hang over a balcony. 

GALE 
What do you want from me? 

MAN'S VOICE  
It's what you want from me. 

Silence. 

GALE 
What do you mean? 

MAN'S VOICE 
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The 
story's not over. 

GALE 
You're getting obvious. 

MAN'S VOICE 
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon. 

GALE 
No, wait... 

MAN'S VOICE 
Watch your back. 

CLICK. The phone goes dead. Gale spins around, doing 
quick circle to make sure no one's around her. She turns and heads off, 
right into... 

DEWEY.  They both GASP. 

CUT TO: 
INT. CAMPUS THEATRE - DAY 
A large tiered theatre. Seats five-hundred. Old but preserved and 
updated. 
A rehearsal is in progress. SEVERAL ACTORS stand stage center running 
lines as stagehands 
work on the set around them. 

Sidney is one of them. She moves around the stage, very animated. More 
alive than ever. 
She dons a Russian accent. Convincing. A promising actress. 

SIDNEY 
(in character) "Pain, yah, such pain. Pain." 

Pain. Pain. 

An awkward silence. Everyone looks at each other. Finally, Lois, the 
bitchy sorority girl 
speaks up. 

LOIS 
That's not the line. You jumped. 

SIDNEY 
Shit. Did I? 

LOIS 
About a page. 

DIRECTOR 
(off stage) CUT! Let's take five. 

The actors break up as Sidney, frustrated, walks across a make shift 
bridge that takes 
her across the orchestra pit and down the stairs into the house where 
Hallie sits watching. 
Sid's bodyguards can be seen sitting scattered about. 

HALLIE 
That was good. 

SIDNEY 
Yeah, right. 

The DIRECTOR, mid-30's, intelligent, friendly. 

DIRECTOR  
Sid, why don't you get outta here? We'll pick this up tomorrow. 

Sid nods in agreement. The Director smiles at her. 

DIRECTOR  (cont'd) 
Work on the accent. 

She grabs her things and heads off with Hallie when... 

VOICE 
Sid? 

Sid turns to find Randy moving through an aisle. He had been watching 
rehearsal. 
Sid's face tenses. 

HALLIE  
Who is that guy? 

SIDNEY 
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside. 

HALLIE 
No, girletta, I don't leave your side. 

SIDNEY 
I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please. 

Sid is definite. Hallie backs off, heading up the aisle, against her 
better wishes. 

SIDNEY 
What do you want? 

RANDY 
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I 
know I'm stupid. 
I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, 
Sid, don't be mad at me. 

SIDNEY 
Do you work for her now? 

RANDY 
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. 
I'm sorry about 
Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but 
it seemed like a 
quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at 
him Long and hard, 
a smile slowly appearing. 

SIDNEY 
Me, too. Randy. Me too. 

He nods, knowingly. 

SIDNEY (cont'd) 
Wanna get outta here? 

CUT TO: 

INT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - AFTERNOON 
Gale and Dewey are with Captain Tyler and Sheriff Evans. 

CAPTAIN TYLER 
If he calls again--find help. Don't engage him in conversation. I'm 
gonna put a man on 
you--to cover you. 

DEWEY 
I can do it, Captain. 

CAPTAIN TYLER 
Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off... 

GALE 
I'd prefer Dewey, Captain. 

Tyler doesn't argue. He's too crazed. Dewey avoids Gale's stare. 

DEWEY 
How's the name search going? 

CAPTAIN TYLER 
37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 
Riley's. 
And that's just on campus. It's hopeless. 

CUT TO: 

INT. CINEPLEX MOVIE THEATRE - LITTLE LATER 
A movie is in progress. STAB. 

ON SCREEN 
A young girl, looking a lot like Tori Spelling, runs down a school 
corridor. She runs smack 
into a young, handsome boy. He could very well be Johnny Depp. 

TORI 
(in movie) Oh, God, Billy, you scared me. What are you doing here?

JOHNNY
(in movie) They let me go, Sid, I didn't do it. I'm innocent. 

IN THE THEATRE 
Sid and Randy sit in the small cineplex mall type theatre. Behind them 
sit Sid's trusting 
police guards. Sidney shifts in her seat. 

RANDY 
You okay, Sid? 

SIDNEY 
Yeah. 

ON SCREEN 
Tori Spelling and Johnny Depp continue their dramatic discussion. 

JOHNNY  
(in movie) When my mom left my dad, I accepted it. That's just the way 
the cookie crumbles. 
Moms leave. 

TORI 
Yeah, but your mom left town. She's not dead. My mom's dead. Do you 
hear me? 
She's dead. Dead. And she's never coming back. Ever, Ever. 

IN THE THEATRE 
Sidney grows increasingly uneasy. 

CUT TO: 

INT. STUDENT CAFETERIA - LATER 
Mickey, Joel, and Derek are crowded around a table in the Student Union 
Cafeteria. 

DEREK 
My documentary is due on Tuesday. 

MICKEY  
What's your subject? 

DEREK 
I WAS A SORORITY SLUT. 

JOEL 
You should of done it on Sidney. That would have been a cool. 

DEREK 
She wouldn't let me. 

MICKEY 
Not with Primetime Live and 20/20 coming at her. I'd save my shit too. 

Hallie comes waltzing up. 

DEREK  
Where's Sid? 

HALLIE 
Damned if I know. She ditched me. 

DEREK 
You weren't supposed to leave her alone. 

HALLIE 
I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. 
They went off together. 

Hallie plops down, giving Mickey  a big kiss. 

MICKEY  
I've been waiting for you, baby. 

JOEL 
Is that cool? Just to leave her like that? 

HALLIE
She's got guards with her. 

DEREK  
What guy? 

HALLIE
Randy somebody. 

JOEL 
Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro. 

MICKEY 
Her old boyfriend?

JOEL 
No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend. 
MICKEY
Watch out, Derek. 

HALLIE
He tried to kill her first. 

MICKEY 
Is Sid in therapy? 

JOEL 
She was for a while. Gave it up. 

DEREK 
How do you know so much about her? 

JOEL  
I read the book. 

MICKEY  
I could use some therapy. 

DEREK 
Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just 
showed up and now 
people are dying? 

HALLIE 
He seemed harmless. 

DEREK 
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless? 

JOEL 
And white. 

MICKEY 
Easy black boy. 

JOEL 
It's documented. 
Most serial killers are attractive--slightly off white males in their 
twenties. 

HALLIE 
That's you, honey. 

Hallie kisses Mickey again.

MICKEY  
I got a surprise for you. 

HALLIE 
What? 

Suddenly, he leaps up on the cafeteria table and begins to sing at the 
top of his lungs. 

MICKEY  
"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I 
know, I'll think 
of you each step of the way... 

HALLIE 
Don't do this. 

MICKEY 
"And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always love you OOOOOOWUOOOOOOOO will always 
love you." 

Everyone has taken notice. They begin to cheer and sing with him. 

JOEL (to Derek) 
Whitney? 

DEREK 
I think he's doing Dolly. 

MICKEY 
"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of 
offffff. 
I wish you JOYYY." 

DEREK 
Definitely Whitney. 

Hallie can't help but be touched. He finishes up, ending on a last, 
final note. As he does, 
he pulls a necklace from around his neck. His Greek letters dangle from 
it. He places them 
around her neck, kissing her. 

JOEL 
Isn't that a big no-no? 

DEREK 
I think so. 

Hallie breaks away. She swats him.
HALLIE 
You're going to get it. You know what happens. 

MICKEY
But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it. 

Hallie smiles, her eyes misty. Derek and Joel eye each other. 

CUT TO: 

INT. CINEPLEX MOVIE THEATRE  - LITTLE LATER 
Sid and Randy continue watching the movie. The guards behind them are 
way engrossed. 

ON SCREEN 
It's the end of the movie. Tori Spelling is running for her life from 
two killers - 
Johnny Depp and his sidekick. She finds herself trapped in the kitchen. 
Johnny Depp holds 
the knife up to Tori's face. 

TORI 
Why did you kill my mother? 

JOHNNY 
Because she was sleeping with my dad. She's the reason my mom left. 
She was a whore just like you. 

IN THE THEATRE  
These words sting Sid. Randy notices her flinching. 

ON SCREEN 

TORI 
My mom was no whore. Don't you say that. 

JOHHNY 
Whore! Whore! Whore! Whore! 

Tori starts to cry. 

IN THE THEATRE 
Tears find their way down Sidney's cheeks. 

ON SCREEN
Johnny Depp and his murderous sidekick start stabbing each other. 

JOHNNY (cont'd) 
It's the perfect alibi, Sidney. 

SIDEKICK 
Just like in the movies. 

IN THE THEATRE 
Sidney can't take it anymore. She gets up and races out of the theatre. 

INT. LOBBY - A SECOND LATER 
Sid emerges from the theatre and into the lobby. She moves into a 
curtained section where 
the water fountain is. She looks up and sees Randy flying out of the 
theatre. He exits 
outside looking for her. The cops are right behind him. 

VOICE 
Hello Sidney. 

Sidney spins around. Cotton Weary stands before her. shoulders slumped, 
his face pained. 

SIDNEY 
Cotton. 

COTTON 
Can we talk? 

SIDNEY 
I don't think that's a good idea. 

COTTON 
Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and 
ratings. 

SIDNEY 
What do you want from me, Cotton? 

COTTON 
You could start with an apology. 

SIDNEY 
I did that. 

COTTON 
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate. 

SIDNEY 
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year 
of your 
life--how do I apologize for that? 

COTTON 
I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have 
nothing now. 
Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging 
on by threads. 

SIDNEY 
Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded 
of what I've done. 
I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or 
spiritual plane can 
ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in 
me what you need to 
hear but I don't think the words exist. 

More silence. 

COTTON 
I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help. 

SIDNEY 
Did it? 

COTTON 
It helped me realize one thing. 

SIDNEY 
What? 

COTTON 
You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother. 

And with that, Cotton flips on a dime. His face turns evil. Sidney 
races by him as he 
throws out his arm, stopping her just as... 

THE TWO POLICE GUARDS 
appear, grabbing him from behind. They throw him against the wall, 
retaining him. Randy 
appears at Sid's side. 

RANDY 
You okay?

Sid nods as she watches the officers arrest him. They do a body search, 
pulling from his 
coat a large revolver. Cotton just smiles. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - LATER 
Sid and Randy walk up the steps to the school library. The ever helping 
guards behind them. 

SIDNEY 
I don't know. I don't think Cotton did it. It's too predictable. 

RANDY 
If he's innocent he'll have an alibi. 

SIDNEY 
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive. 

RANDY 
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home? 

SIDNEY 
I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. 
She mimes an air lock valve. 

RANDY 
I gotta coupla of those buttons myself. 

There's something sad about this exchange. These two people understand 
each other 

SIDNEY 
Thanks for the movie, Randy. 

RANDY 
Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that 
feeling. 

Sidney watches as Randy shoves off, disappearing across campus. Sid 
turns to find Derek 
leaning against a pole. 

DEREK 
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is 
everything okay? 

SIDNEY 
No, it's not. 

DEREK 
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you 
don't trust me. 

SIDNEY  
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection 
errors when it 
comes to men. 

DEREK 
Then I'll make this easy for you. I like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid. 
But I'm gonna stay away. Until you say otherwise. 

A long moment. He looks at her, hoping she'll say otherwise. 

SIDNEY 
I'm sorry, Derek. 

Derek nods. So that's how it's going to be. He turns and wanders off, 
not looking back once. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. NEWSVAN  - CAMPUS - LATER 
The newsvan is parked at a curb. It sits out of the way overlooking the 
student commons area. 
A grassy area where students sit and conjugate. 

Gale walks back and forth with the cellular attached to her ear. Dewey 
sits leans against the 
van, watching her. He still has a crush but hides it as best he can. 

GALE 
(on phone) The interview's not going to happen. 1 changed my mind. 
I've harassed the girl enough. It's in poor taste and a bad idea. 
(from the phone "Your entire career is in poor taste...") Gotta go, 
call me when you have 
something nice to say. 

Gale hangs up, she looks to Dewey. Smiles. 

DEWEY 
So what made you change your mind about Sidney? 

GALE 
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive. 

DEWEY 
You're a hard one to figure out. 
GALE 
It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate. 

DEWEY 
I think you're all an act. 

GALE 
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit. 

DEWEY 
I know that. 

GALE 
Yeah? 

DEWEY 
I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite 
huge tabloid 
success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which 
directly effects 
your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed 
relationships with--I'm 
guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a 
cell phone. But I bet 
sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the 
surface and in a 
moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched 
and held and fondled. 

Gale stares at him, stunned. A moment as the tension swirls about them. 

GALE 
And where did you gain all of your Gale Weather's insight? 

Dewey approaches her. Gale has never been more taken with him. They 
stand incredibly close.

DEWEY 
After my spinal cord was damaged I was laid up for over a year. A lot 
can happen when 
you're on your back. 

They're nearly touching now. Just then, Randy approaches. 

RANDY 
What'd I miss? 

Gale backs away from Dewey, breathless. Her cellular phone 
RINGS. She eyes Dewey, then hands it to Randy.

GALE 
I'm not here. 

Randy takes the phone. 

RANDY 
Hello?

MAN'S VOICE 
Gale?

RANDY 
She's not here right now. 

MAN'S VOICE 
But she's standing right next to you. 

Shit! Randy motions to Gale and Dewey. It's him. He points around 
campus, mouthing "He's 
watching." Gale grabs Dewey. 

GALE 
C'mon. 
(to Randy) 
Keep him talking. 

Gale and Dewey race off, across the grassy area where 
STUDENTS come and go. 

ON RANDY 
He holds the phone, scared, not knowing what to say? 

RANDY 
So...what's your favorite scary movie? No response. Silence. 

MAN'S VOICE 
They'll never find me. 

Randy eyes Dewey and Gale, they move through STUDENTS, searching. 

RANDY 
What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up? 

MAN'S VOICE 
What's your favorite scary movie? 

RANDY 
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? 
Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION 
DAY? THE DORM THAT 
DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close? 

MAN'S VOICE 
Closer than you think. 

ON DEWEY AND GALE 
They move through passing STUDENTS. 

GALE 
He has to be nearby. He likes the game. 

Dewey is on the his walkie. "I need back-up." He has a hard time 
keeping up with Gale. 
He hobbles along. 

BACK ON RANDY
He goes on a tirade pacing back and forth. 

RANDY 
So what's your deal? Can we talk openly for a second? How does one 
become a serial killer? 
Huh? Are you psychopathic or merely psychotic? And what is the 
distinguishing feature'? 
Were you slapped around as a child? Is it hereditary? Did your Mom take 
test drugs? 
You know, have you tried getting laid? It's done wonders for my 
homicidal tendencies. 

MAN'S VOICE 
Do you want to die? 

RANDY 
Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? 
Some tired hand me 
down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie 
rights. Nothing. 
I've been through this before and much better I might add.

ON GALE AND DEWEY 
Gale spots a YOUNG MAN, sitting with some other KIDS. He's talking on a 
cellular phone. 
She races to him and rips it from his hands. He leaps up ready to 
pounce on her. 

Dewey appears. 

DEWEY 
It's okay. C'mon, Gale. 

BACK ON RANDY 
Randy won't let up. He continues dissing. 

RANDY 
And if you're such a brilliant smart killer--why copycat? Why not be 
original? 
Where's the innovation? Let's pioneer some new ground. Make a 
statement. Go down in history. 
Now you'll always be the Woodsboro copycat killer. That's lame. It's 
like a bad sequel. 
And why Woodsboro? What about Manson, Bundy, Son of Sam? Why imitate 
two high school 
loser-ass dickheads--1 knew the guys. Stu was a wussy ass wet rag and 
Billy--jesus--what 
a rat-looking homo-repressed, mama's boy.

Suddenly the newsvan door RIPS OPEN, A GHOST MASKED FIGURE lunges out 
grabbing Randy by 
the neck. The move is quick and precise. A hard yank and Randy is 
wrenched back into the 
newsvan. The door SLAMS shut. 

ON DEWEY AND GALE 
As they run back to the newsvan. SIRENS are heard in the distant. Gale 
races up to find 
Randy nowhere. 

GALE 
Randy? Randy? Where did he go? 

Dewey circles the van as Gale moves to the sliding side door. She tears 
it open as... 

RANDY'S BODY FALLS OUT. Blood everywhere. His throat slit. 

Gale's SCREAM is heard all over campus.

CUT TO: 
EXT. CRIME SCENE - NEWSVAN - LATER 
Yellow tape has been placed around the newsvan. People have gathered as 
Randy's body is taken 
out on a stretcher. 

Captain Tyler and Sheriff Hartley share frustrated faces. 

SHERIFF 
He's broken his pattern. 

CAPTAIN TYLER 
They've broken their pattern. 

SHERIFF 
You're sure about this two person thing? 

CAPTAIN TYLER 
Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one 
person. 

Different UNIFORMS whirl by. 

SHERIFF 
I would say we are now officially baffled. 

CAPTAIN TYLER 
On national television. 

Sheriff Hartley looks up as REPORTERS flock them, surrounding them in 
questions. 

CUT TO: 

INT. LIBRARY - RESEARCH COMPUTER ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 
A room of the library sectioned off exclusively for computer use. It 
consists of thirty to 
forty cubicles that house computer terminals. Every cubicle is full. 
The place is packed. 

Sid sits at a terminal busy at work. Her two police guards wander up 
and down the cubicles 
keeping an eye out. 

CLOSE ON SIDNEY 
Her face appears concentrated, focused. She scans the computer screen 
in front of her. 

ON THE MONITOR
Sid is typing feverishly. Suddenly, her screen starts flashing and 
BEEPING, freezing her words. 

ON SIDNEY confused, she tries to make it stop but it won't. She leans 
back, turning to the 
GUY next to her. A handsome young man. 

SIDNEY 
Excuse me? Did your computer just freeze? 

The guy leans over and takes a look at Sid's monitor. 

GUY (cont'd) 
You have an instant message, that's all. Just hit ALT M. 

SIDNEY 
I'm not signed on. 

GUY 
Someone here in the room. All the terminals are connected. 

The guy returns to his own computer. Sidney eyes the screen 
suspiciously. 
She hits ALT M. A message pops up on the screen. 
"YOU'RE GOING TO DIE TONIGHT." 

Sidney freaks. A muffled CRY. She shoots up, looking about the crowded 
room. 
He could be anywhere. The two guards take notice, rushing over to her. 

SIDNEY 
He's here. He's in the room right now. 

She points to the screen. The men instantly break up and cover the 
room. They start pulling 
people from their terminals to check their screens. 

Sidney backs away from her screen, her terror growing. 

Suddenly, it starts flashing and BEEPING again. She looks around. She 
slowly moves toward it, 
drawn uncontrollably. She hits ALT M. Another message pops up: 
"THE POLICE CAN'T SAVE YOU." 

CLOSE ON SIDNEY'S FACE. 
It's stone pale. She takes a deep breath and begins to type. 

ON THE MONITOR 
The words FUCK YOU appear. Sid hits SEND. 

INT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - PRIVATE OFFICE - LITTLE LATER 
Captain Tyler and Sheriff Hartley are drilling a very subdued and cool 
Cotton. 

COTTON 
What better alibi could I have? I was here in custody. 

CAPTAIN TYLER 
Maybe you don't work alone. 

COTTON 
Yeah, that's it. 

SHERIFF 
Why did you attack Sidney Prescott? 

COTTON 
There was no attack, we were talking. Very heatedly. Miss Prescott and 
I have a very 
complicated past. That's no crime. 

CAPTAIN TYLER 
And the gun? 

COTTON 
I have a permit. It's registered. I have a legal right to carry it. 

SHERIFF 
Why do you need a gun? 

COTTON 
Gentlemen, your growing hysteria is not reason enough to hold me here. 
I've been down this 
road before. And unless you're going to charge me with a crime I'd like 
to walk outta here. 
I have an interview at 6:00.

CUT TO: 
INT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - OUTER OFFICE 
Gale sits at a table. Dewey approaches. He places a hand on her 
shoulder. 
They're both at a loss.

GALE 
Where's Sidney'? 

DEWEY 
She's safe. 

Silence. 

DEWEY (cont'd) 
How you doin? 

GALE 
Not good. How you doin? 

DEWEY 
Not good. 

Just then, the Sheriff and Captain emerge from their office. Cotton is 
escorted out 
behind them. Gale moves to him. 

DEWEY 
Can't we hold him? 

CAPTAIN TYLER 
No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has 
clemency. We can't run 
the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim 
with knife in hand 
before we make a move. 

DEWEY 
What now? 

ON COTTON 
He stands at a counter, signing forms. Gale approaches. 

GALE
What's going on, Cotton? 

COTTON 
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved 
innocent, released back 
into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive? 

GALE
Did you do it? 

She looks him dead in the eyes.

COTTON 
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. 
You're not having character doubts now, are you? 

GALE 
You have a right to be angry. 

COTTON 
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that. 

GALE 
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you. 

COTTON 
You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you 
sold, Gale? You think I 
don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights? 

Just then, the OFFICER behind the counter brings him his gun in a 
plastic bag. Cotton takes 
it out and checks it over. Gale is surprised to see the gun. 

GALE
Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far. 

COTTON 
Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just 
taking it as it comes. 

Cotton pockets the gun and heads out. Gale rejoins Dewey and the 
others. 

CAPTAIN TYLER 
Night's coming. I think its time to beef up security on the Prescott 
girl. 

GALE 
Where is she? 

SHERIFF 
She was just escorted to her dorm room. 

DEWEY 
Is she safe there? 

CAPTAIN TYLER 
We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. 
And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out 
after dark. 

DEWEY 
That doesn't work, sir. 

GALE 
You're just isolating people. You're giving the killer a blank canvas. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT 
Day turns to night and college life comes to a deadly stand still as 
everyone observes the 
imposed campus restrictions. 

EXT. SIGMA PHI EPISILON - NIGHT 
The fraternity house sits dark and quiet. A YOUNG MAN walks up the walk 
to the front door. 
He TAPS on it three times and it quietly opens as he's ushered in. 

INT SIGMA PHI HOUSE - NIGHT - SAME 
The young man makes his way down a long hallway, down a spiral 
staircase, through a thick 
basement door and into... 

A RAGING PARTY 

Music peels paint as YOUNG COLLEGE STUDENTS rock to deafening tunes. A 
row of kegs line one 
wall as a the party gears up for a drunken night ahead. 

Derek is seen with his video camera. He's filming Lois and Murphy. They 
talk into the camera. 
Both tipsy chatty. 

LOIS  
It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and 
blowjobs but... 

MURPHY 
..we only promote safe rubbered sex. 

LOIS 
..it's really about family and tradition... 

MURPHY
..harmonica style is okay.

LOIS 
I just love being a sister. 

Mickey approaches as Derek finishes up. 

DEREK
Thanks, ladies. 

They take off to the kegs. 

MICKEY 
Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life? 

DEREK 
Not one bit. 

MICKEY 
Where's Sid? 

DEREK 
She dumped me. 

MICKEY 
No way. 

DEREK 
Yeah. 

MICKEY 
You freakin? 

Derek shrugs. He's clearly upset by it when from out of nowhere, 
SEVERAL FRAT BOYS appear, 
picking Mickey up, lifting him over their heads. Everyone starts 
CHEERING and CLAPPING. 

FRATERNITY JOCK 
He lavaliered. He's dead. 

They carry him around the room, CHANTING. The frat boys abduct Mickey, 
taking him up the 
stairs and out sight. Others lookie loo's follow. Derek grabs his 
camera and bolts. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SIDNEY'S DORM ROOM - EVENING 
Sidney is trying to focus on homework while Hallie channel surfs. She 
finds a channel. 
On screen, Siskel a Ebert are reviewing a movie.

EBERT 
(from TV) I enjoyed its clever execution... 

HALLIE  
We're missing the Sig Ep party. 

SIDNEY 
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. 
Trust me. 

HALLIE 
No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed. 

Hallie clearly wishes she were there. 

SISKEL 
(from TV) It was just an excuse to kill young, big breasted girls. I 
didn't like it. 

They're reviewing STAB. Hallie switches channels. There's a KNOCK on 
the door. 
Sid answers--it's Dewey and Gale. From the look on their faces... 

SIDNEY 
Someone else has been killed. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DELTA ZETA HOUSE - BACK YARD- LITTLE LATER 
SPLAT! Gobs of gooey food goes flying through the air exploding 
perfectly all over... 

MICKEY 

who stands buck naked, tied...chained to a tree in the back yard. The 
yard is crowded with 
FRAT BOYS and SORORITY GIRLS who delight in torching him. Mounds of 
syrup, eggs, and other 
wet and slimy food is plunged upon him. 

FRATERNITY JOCK 
Who do you love? 

MICKEY 
Hallie. 

FRATERNITY JOCK 
Did you say "My TKE brothers"? 

MICKEY 
No, I said Hallie. 

More food and slime come barreling at him. A drunk Lois and Murphy pull 
the police tape down 
from the previous night's crime scene and begin to Mayflower him. The 
crowd goes crazy. 

INT. SIDNEY'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
Hallie consoles Sidney. Dewey and Gale nearby. Sidney is a stone rock. 
It's frightening to 
watch her hold it together. 

SIDNEY 
I'm fine. I wish people would stop treating me like glass. I'm not 
gonna break. 

HALLIE 
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to. 

SIDNEY 
I'd really just like to be alone. 

DEWEY 
The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere 
safe. 

SIDNEY 
Dewey, there's no such place. 

DEWEY 
Humor me, Sid. 

Sidney starts packing an overnight bag. 

HALLIE 
Can I come with her? 

SIDNEY 
No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright. 

GALE
Sid, I'll come with you. 

SIDNEY 
But who would operate your camera? 

A burn. It comes out of nowhere. Gale goes silent. A KNOCK at the door. 
Dewey opens to 
find a Police guard standing with Joel.

SIDNEY (cont'd) 
He's cool, Remy. 

Joel is ushered in. He says his hello's, moving to Hallie. Gale and 
Dewey move out into the 
hall with the guards. Sid continues to pack. Her face rigid. 

JOEL 
They got Mickey. He's being toasted at the Deltas. 

HALLIE 
I knew it. Shit! I gotta get over there. 

JOEL 
We're under quarantine. 

He points to Dewey who talks to Gale in the hallway. 

HALLIE 
I'm the only one who can cut him down. 

SIDNEY  
It's not a good idea, Hallie. 

JOEL 
I'll go with her. 

HALLIE 
Be safe, girl. 

She gives Sidney a hug before she can object, then she and Joel race 
out into the hallway 
as Dewey sticks his head in. 

DEWEY
Sid, you should get going. 

He looks at Joel and Hallie. 

DEWEY (cont'd) 
Where are you two headed? 

JOEL 
(instant cover) Hallie forgot her footage at the film dept. I'm gonna 
walk her over 
before it's gets too late 

DEWEY 
You really...

HALLIE 
I gotta have it, Dewey. 

Gale steps in. 

GALE 
Hey, Dewey? 

HALLIE  
Seeya, Dewey. 

Hallie and Joel race outta there before any more objections. Dewey 
turns to Gale. 

GALE 
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything 
about the killer 
that you could? 

DEWEY 
Meaning?

GALE 
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this 
Derek? 

DEWEY 
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked. 

GALE 
Billy had alibis too. 

Dewey turns to Sid who now stands ready in the doorway. 

DEWEY 
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay. 

SIDNEY 
Whatever. 

Sidney's exterior keeps hardening. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DELTA ZETA HOUSE - BACK YARD- LITTLE LATER 
Mickey is still tied to the tree. He's so completely covered in 
hardened gook it looks 
like he's wearing clothes. The last of the crowd has left. They've gone 
back to the party. 
He stands shivering in the cold.

He checks the chain that holds him secure. It's composed of several 
bike locks and steel 
twine. He's not going anywhere. BUMP! He hears a noise. He looks to the 
nearby shrubs 
and beyond. Nothing. Just a noise of the night. 

MICKEY 
(whispering) Come on, Hallie, baby... 
CUT TO: 
INT. DEREK'S DORM ROOM - LATER 
A dark room. A slight disturbance at the door and it comes popping 
open. Light from the hall 
floods the room as Dewey and Gale slip in and close the door behind 
them. 

GALE 
(checking door) You broke the lock. 

DEWEY 
You broke my heart. 

GALE
What are we looking for? 

DEWEY 
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that? 

GALE
Can we turn the light on? 

DEWEY 
That's not the way it's done. 

Dewey pulls out his flashlight and begins to search the room. He sifts 
through drawers 
and a closet. 

DEWEY 
And it's sexier in the dark. 

GALE 
Dewey, you and I would never make it. 

DEWEY 
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am... 

GALE 
..and as lonely as I am...

DEWEY 
We'd break some furniture. 

Gale LAUGHS at this. She reaches over and pats his buttock. 

GALE 
Tell you what. We get through this one. And we'll take out a hotel 
room. 
Over here with the light. 

Dewey points the light to a framed picture. It's of Joel and Derek - a 
buddy pose. 
She sifts through some text books on the desk. 

DEWEY 
They're roomates. 

GALE 
And Joel's pre-med. 

DEWEY 
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision. 

GALE
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the 
same 
names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to 
Sidney. They're not 
looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new 
Tatum. 

DEWEY 
Hallie? 

A moment. Then in a splash, they're outta there. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - MINUTES LATER 
A squad car makes it's way down the quiet campus street. 

INT. SQUAD CAR - SAME 
Sidney sits in the backseat. The two police officers ride in front. 

SIDNEY 
Where are you taking me?

POLICE GUARD #1 
Actually, I don't know. 

POLICE GUARD #2 
We're meeting another car that will transport you the rest of the way. 

POLICE GUARD #1 
Safety precautions. 

SIDNEY 
I feel like Eddie Murphy. 

The car comes to a halt in front of a stop light. 

POLICE GUARD #1  
We feel like Kevin Costner.

Sidney smiles at this just as the car door rips open on the passenger's 
side. Two hands 
reach in and yank Police Guard #2 from the car. He starts to CRY OUT 
but it's cut short. 
Sid SCREAMS as the Police Guard behind the wheel struggles with his 
seat belt. He looks up 
to see a Ghost Masked Figure move around the side of the car towards 
his door. He reaches 
for his gun but it's too late. The Ghost has the door open. A flash of 
silver and the Police 
Guard's throat is slit. 

IN THE BACK SEAT 
Sidney SCREAMS and SCREAMS, BEATING on the door of the car. It won't 
open. She's trapped like 
a caged animal. 

IN THE FRONT SEAT 
The Ghost pulls the Police Guard from the car, then gets in, behind the 
driver's seat. The 
Ghost puts the car in drive and takes off down the road. 

Sidney looks behind her as the guard's dead bodies lay sprawled in the 
middle of the road. 
She turns to the door, BEATING and CLAWING at it. She leans back, 
manic, and KICKS at the 
window with her  feet. No use. 

EXT. CAMPUS DRIVE - SAME 
The car makes its way down the deserted street  

IN THE BACKSEAT 
Sidney is beyond frantic. She eyes the Ghost through the gate. She 
turns and twists looking 
for an escape. Through the window, she sees approaching headlights. She 
SCREAMS through 
the closed window as a car passes by. Sidney takes notice as the car 
turns onto another 
campus street. Big, stone school buildings line each side of a thin, 
road. 

She eyes the Ghost through the rearview window. The white masks turns 
as hidden eyes bore 
through her. The Ghost hits the gas, picking up speed. 

Sidney looks to the book bag on the seat beside her. She rips it open, 
rustling through it 
frantically. She pulls books, pencils, paper... Sid grabs a long, 
yellow No.2 pencil. She 
grips it hard, looking to the metal grate just behind the driver's 
seat. The Ghost's neck 
is right up against it. 

Sid takes the pencil and positions it right behind the Ghost's head, 
ready to attack. 

Without pause, Sid RAMS the pencil through the grate, into the Ghost's 
neck. It lodges 
there as the Ghost falls forward in pain, losing control of the wheel 
for a moment. 

The car jumps the curb and SLAMS against a building. The Ghost yanks 
the wheel, over 
correcting. He tries to bring it back to the road but doesn't see the 
lamp post that stands 
directly in the car's path. 

The Squad car makes direct contact with the lamp post, SLAMMING into 
it, bringing the car 
to a CRASHING HALT, lodging it agaisnt the building's stone exterior. 
Smoke rises from a 
bashed engine as it emits a fatal rumbling. 

INSIDE THE CAR 
All is still. In the backseat, Sidney rises from the floorboards. She 
looks up to see the 
Ghost Masked figure slumped over the steering wheel. Out. 

Sid quickly pulls herself together, looking about, sizing up her 
options. She tugs on the 
door handle. It won't budge. She looks to the passenger's side of the 
car. It's flush 
against the building. 

Then she notices the metal grate. The edge has been pried apart in the 
crash. Sidney reaches 
for it, pulling on it, bending it backwards... 
CREAK!

Sid tries to stifle the noise it makes, all the while eyeing the Ghost 
who remains 
unconscious. She creates an opening large enough for her to crawl 
through. She lifts 
herself up and pulls herself through to the... 
FRONT SEAT 

Sid falls down into the seat, her eyes never leaving the Ghost. She lay 
crumpled up against 
the smashed passenger's door, the only sound is her own TERRIFIED 
BREATHING. She watches the 
Ghost Masked Figure. His body doesn't move. She contemplates her next 
move. 

The only way out is through the driver's door. 
After what seems an eternity, she slowly reaches over with her foot and 
nudges the Ghost. 
No movement. Nothing. She slides across the seat towards the Ghost, 
moving to his side. 
She reaches with her hand and pushes on the Ghost's shoulder. His body 
moves, slumping back 
against the back of the seat. It clears space for her to pass through. 
She sits up on her feet, facing the Ghost. With her leg, she reaches 
over him, straddling him. 
She leans against the steering wheel, her arm quickly reaching for the 
door knob. 
HONK! 

Her back brushes against the horn. Sid TENSES, her face a little more 
than a foot from the 
Ghost Mask. He doesn't move. He's completely out cold. Sid pushes the 
car door open and starts 
to slide completely over the Ghost when she stops. 

She looks to the Ghost. CLOSE ON HER FACE as she fights with a 
decision. Then, with a fierce 
determination, Sid reaches for the Ghost Mask. She finds the edge and 
begins to peels the Mask 
away when... 

THE GHOST COMES TO LIFE 

lunging forward. Sidney SCREAMS, leaping, falling out the car door. 

OUTSIDE THE CAR 

BAM! 

Sid hits the pavement hard. She lifts herself up when her entire 
body is YANKED VIOLENTLY BACKWARDS.

The Ghost has hold of her foot, pulling her back into the car. Sidney 
KICKS and WRITHES 
breaking free. She hops to her feet as the Ghost emerges from the car. 
Sidney SLAMS the car 
door shut. It catches the Ghost, knocking him backwards. Sid tears off, 
down the street, 
running, burning up the pavement.
CUT TO: 
EXT. FILM SCHOOL - MINUTES LATER 
The film school sits in the still darkness. 

INT. HALLWAY - SAME 
Dewey and Gale move down a dark and shadowed hallway. THUMP! They stop 
cold. 

GALE 
Ssshh! What was that? 

DEWEY 
Let's find out. 

Dewey keeps moving. 

GALE
This is all too familiar. 

DEWEY 
Over here. 

Dewey has lead her to a door marked LECTURE HALL. 

INT. LECTURE HALL - SAME 
The same room seen earlier. A large, rounded room with three levels of 
seats that shoot 
straight up to the ceiling. A podium stands center. Video monitors hang 
from the ceiling in 
different places around the room. 

Dewey and Gale enter. If not for the red EXIT SIGNS that hang over the 
exit doors, the room 
would be completely dark. They move down the first level of chairs to 
the lecturn. 

GALE 
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere. 

DEWEY 
C'mon. Let's go. 

CLICK! STATIC! A noise from above takes their attention. They looks up 
as a video monitor 
comes to life. Images appear. 

CLOSE ON MONITOR 
Home-made video footage fills the screen. A movie theatre, people 
standing in line. 
The home camera ZOOMS in to a YOUNG COUPLE. Maureen and Phil come into 
view. 

ON DEWEY AND GALE 
Gale watches the screen as Dewey looks around the room, searching for 
it's source. 

CLICK! Another monitor comes to life. More home shot video footage. 
This time of a big house. 
A closer look reveals it to be the Chi Omega Sorority House. A young 
girl stands on the front 
porch talking on a portable phone. It's Cici. 

ON GALE AND DEWEY 

GALE 
Jesus Christ! 

DEWEY 
He filmed his victims. 

CLICK! ANOTHER MONITOR TURNS ON 
It's Randy standing outside the newsvan with the cellular phone to his 
ear. 

CLICK! Another monitor turns on. It's of a man and woman back to the 
camera. The couple 
move in frame. It becomes apparent quick. It's Gale and Dewey. As they 
stand in the 
room--live. They're being taped. 

CLOSE ON DEWEY AND GALE 

GALE 
Shit! 

Dewey spins around. He reaches for the gun he no longer carries. 

DEWEY 
Dammit! 

He looks around the room, up to the two levels above them. He spots a 
small light on the 
second level. He squints his eyes and sees a FIGURE standing behind it. 

GALE 
Let's go. 

DEWEY 
No, wait here. 

Dewey hands her his flashlight and takes off for the stair rise that 
leads to the upper level. 

GALE 
No, Dewey, let's call for backup. 

But Dewey is gone, leaving Gale alone. She turns to the monitor to see 
her face in 
fear-stricken CLOSE UP. 

ON THE UPPER LEVEL 
Dewey moves fast, limping his way to the level's edge. He approaches 
the railing and makes 
his way around to the shining light. 

He reaches it, finding nothing but a camera and tripod. It sits alone 
against the railing. 
Dewey surveys the second level. Empty seats everywhere. Completely 
bare. 

Dewey looks down to the main floor...to Gale who looks up to him. 

GALE 
Dewey? 

DEWEY 
There's nothing. I'm coming down. 

Dewey turns to leave, his eye catching a monitor that hangs level with 
the railing. On the 
monitor, Gale is in frame, looking up at Dewey, her face fear stained. 
She takes a step 
forward, moving out of frame, revealing 

THE GHOST 

who stands right behind her. Dewey looks down to see the Ghost standing 
directly behind Gale. 

DEWEY (cont'd) 
Watch out! 

DOWN BELOW 
Gale turns just in time to see the gleam of a killer's knife as it 
darts out of the 
darkness. Gale catapults, just dodging it. She moves like lightning up 
the aisle of seats. 

UP ABOVE 
Dewey races for the stairs, going as fast as his handicapped leg will 
allow. 

DOWN BELOW 
Gale tears out the exit door, the Killer right behind her. 

AT THE LECTURN
Dewey arrives, searching, looking for Gale. 

DEWEY (cont'd) 
Gale! 

He eyes the exit door as it slowly closes. He moves for it. 

INT. CORRIDOR  - SAME 
Gale races down the hallway, eyeing the nearest door. She tears it 
open, disappearing into... 

INT. SOUND STAGE - SAME 
Gale finds herself in the student studios. She stands in a huge control 
booth that 
overlooks a dubbing stage. Lots of glass walls and doors. It has a maze 
quality. 

Gale moves out a side door and into a dubbing room. Darkness everywhere 
Gale stops for a 
second, listening as she main door CREAKS open. And then FOOTSTEPS are 
heard, making their 
way towards her. 

Gale proceeds deeper into the studio. She moves into a sound proof room 
and closes 
the door. Not seeing the... 

GHOST FIGURE 

that stands behind her. She turns around and SCREAMS. She starts out, 
but then realizes 
he's standing in the control booth. She's protected by a clear, large, 
plexiglass window 
that wraps around the room. The ghost moves out the side door, heading 
her way. He disappears 
out of view. Gale freaks. She races to the door, trying to secure it. 
There's no lock. 

AT THE MAIN DOOR 
Dewey slips through quietly, trying his best to be quick on his toes. 
Through the control 
booth window, he immediately spots Gale. 

INSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM 
Gale looks for objects to block the door with. She drags a shelf of 
sound equipment towards 
the door. 

OUTSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM 
Dewey moves to the window. 

DEWEY 
Gale!  Gale! 

She doesn't hear him. The room is sound proof. He BEATS against the 
glass. Still, she doesn't 
turn to him. 

INSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM 
Gale shoves everything she can find against the door, not seeing or 
hearing Dewey as he 
POUNDS against the sound proof barrier behind her. 

She also doesn't see the Killer that appears behind Dewey. He moves on 
him swift and focused. 

INSIDE THE DUBBING STAGE 
Gale can't take her eyes off the door. Her face is terrified. If she'd 
only turn around, 
she would see Dewey - his face terror stricken as a knife is hurled 
into him repeatedely. 
With each thrust, blood is splattered against the glass. 

IN THE CONTROL BOOTH 
Dewey SCREAMS for his life, caught completely off guard. He falls 
forward onto the control 
panels. Suddenly, microphone feedback tears through the studios as 
Dewey's CRIES are heard 
throughout the stage. 

IN THE DUBBING STAGE 
Dewey's DEATH SCREAM rips through the room. 

Gale turns to the window to see Dewey, his face smashed against it, 
blood smeared across the 
glass. She moves to the window, her face only inches from his. A moment 
as their eyes meet. 
Dewey's life is near gone. His eyes reveal it. Gale BEATS against the 
glass window. 

GALE(through tears) 
NOOOOOOO! 

Dewey's body slides down, out of view. Gale is mortified. She looks to 
the Killer who has 
already made his way through the control booth. He's coming for her. 
She races to the door, 
throws the things away. 

She manages to pull the door open just enough to slide through. And 
she's off and running. 

Gale finds a door and plows through it, stopping only long enough to 
lock it. 

BAM! The Ghost RAMS it from the other side but it holds. Gale surveys 
her surroundings. 
She's in a storage room. She eyes another door. She moves through it 
and out into... 

THE HALLWAY 
Gale shoots down it. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CAMPUS STREET - SECONDS LATER 
Sidney races down the deserted street. Not a soul in sight. She reaches 
a corner, moves off 
the road and passes through a series of trees and shrubs, coming out 
onto... 

EXT. SORORITY ROW - SAME 
The houses have long since gone to sleep. The Delta Zeta House stares 
at Sidney. Lights burn 
from within. Sid goes for it. 

EXT. DELTA ZETA FRONT PORCH - SAME 
Sid makes her way up the front porch. She POUNDS on the front door, 
SCREAMING her lungs out. 

SIDNEY 
SOMEBODYPLEASEOPENUPSOMEBODY! 

Sid wastes no time, she moves along the wraparound porch, beating at 
the windows. 
But nothing. Everybody is off partying. Suddenly, Sid hears something. 
A WHIMPERING. She 
turns to find Murphy and Lois, laying, strewn across the end of the 
porch. Passed out. 

Sid runs to them. 

SIDNEY (cont'd) 
Oh God, help me. We have to call the police. 

Sid kneels over Murphy, shaking her. Murphy's eyes open and she 
GIGGLES. The girl is 
completely wasted. She has no comprehension skills at all. 

SIDNEY (cont'd) 
Do you have keys? I need to get inside. 

Sid looks to Lois. She's in worse shape. 

SIDNEY (cont'd) 
Shit! 

Sid contemplates, not knowing what to do. She leaves them, moving down 
off the porch and 
around to the back of the house. She gets to the back door, tries it. 
It's locked too. 

Sidney checks out the yard. Off to the side, she spots a big tree with 
a... 

BODY, lying next to it in a heap on the ground She moves toward it. 

As Sid approaches she sees clearly that it's Mickey. He lay on his 
side, curled, knees to 
chest, his arm still chained to the tree. 

SIDNEY (cont'd) 
Mickey? Mickey?  

A look of dread creeps across her face. He lay there very much dead. 

SIDNEY (cont'd) 
Oh God, no, Mickey... 

She kneels over his body just as it stirs, lifting up, rising. Mickey's 
face comes into view, 
coated in dried funk, his eyes wide. 

MICKEY 
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night. 

SIDNEY 
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here. 

MICKEY  
What are you talking about? 

SIDNEY 
He's after me. 

Mickey pulls on his chained arm. 

MICKEY 
Shit! You've got to cut me down, Sid. 

Sid inspects the chain. It's meant to hold. 

SIDNEY 
I'll be right back. 

MICKEY
Where you going? 

Sidney moves to the shed that's attached to the garage. Leaning against 
the side are a row of 
garden tools. Sid settles on a shovel. 

Sid returns to Mickey who has risen to his feet. He's pulling and 
twisting the bike chain 
that binds him. 

SIDNEY 
Watch out. 

Sid lifts the shovel up and brings it down directly on the lock. It 
bends somewhat but 
stays in tact. 

MICKEY 
Do it again. 

CLANK! A noise behind them. They both spin around peering into the 
night. 

MICKEY (CONT'D) 
What was that? 

SIDNEY 
Don't panic. 

Sidney, determined, raises the shovel high and brings it down with 
great force. It CRACKS 
the lock, loosening it. Mickey pulls on it. It won't quite give. 

SIDNEY (cont'd) 
Watch out. 

Sid raises the shovel again, unfaltering. She doesn't see the Ghost 
Masked Figure that 
slides down from the tree branch behind her. The Figure moves quickly 
and gracefully, 
coming to a stance directly behind Sid. 

Mickey looks up, just in time.

MICKEY 
SIDNEYWATCHOUT! 

Sid turns just as the Killer strikes. But Sid is ready. Without 
thought, she swings the shovel 
at the Ghost, catching his mid-section, sending him flying.  Mickey 
goes ballistic chained 
to the tree. He pulls, twists, squirms...anything to free himself. 

The Ghost rises, moving on Mickey. Sidney sees this. 

SIDNEY
Hey. 

Sidney distracts the Ghost. She takes off, the Ghost following her. She 
moves around the tree, 
sprinting across the yard, running smack into... 

THE GHOST MASKED KILLER 

But Sidney spins around as two Ghosts appear on each side of her. She 
stands THUNDERSTRUCK as 
the two Killers descend on her. She dives between the two but they 
counter, keeping her 
surrounded. 

Sid watches as one of the Ghosts withdraws his knife. She turns to the 
other. 
His knife is already poised. They close in on her, ready to strike. 

She looks for an escape. There's not one. BAM! 

Suddenly, Mickey appears, barreling into one of the Ghosts. They go 
sprawling across the grass. 

MICKEY 
Run, Sid... 

Sidney makes her break, she runs passed them, towards the front of the 
yard. 

Mickey leaps to his feat. The Killer right behind him. He now finds 
himself in Sid's 
predicament. He doesn't know where to run. The two Killer's close in on 
him. 
Sidney gets to the corner of the house. She stops...she doesn't want to 
leave Mickey.  
She turns back around just in time to see... 

Mickey sandwiched in between the two Ghosts. They're knives strike at 
the same time. 
One through the stomach, the other through the back. They withdraw 
their knives. 
Mickey's body suspends, momentarily hanging in the air. Then collapses 
to a heap on the ground. 

Both Ghosts turn to Sid at the same time. She takes off running, along 
the side of the house, 
through a row of shrub that take her to... 

EXT. STREET - SAME 
Sid is back on the campus street, running down the middle of 
it. 

She spots a car stopped at a red light half a block up. KIDS are 
inside, rock music BLARES. 
Sid SCREAMS and SCREAMS but they don't hear her. She runs, feet 
pounding, toward them but the 
light turns green and the car takes off. It's taillights fading in the 
night. 

She turns finding herself alone in a parking lot. The theatre sits in 
the distance. 
She spots someone entering the theatre. It looks like Hallie. 

SIDNEY 
Hallie? 

But Hallie doesn't hear her. Sid races forward. 

CUT TO:

EXT. CAMPUS  MINUTES LATER
Gale races down the empty campus street. She eyes an emergency phone 
thats attached to a 
street lamp. She goes for it.

Gale rips the phone from its cradle, presses the CALL button.

VOICE (from phone)
What is your emergency please?

GALE
Someones trying to kill me. I need the police.

VOICE
Are you in danger now?

GALE
Yes, goddammit!

VOICE
Where is your attacker?

GALE
I dont know.

VOICE
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.

GALE
The safety what? Fuck that! 

Just then, Gale hears a NOISE. A door opening. She looks up to see 
Sidney disappear through 
the side theatre door.

GALE
SIDNEY!

But Sidney has already disappeared inside. Gale yells into the phone.

GALE (contd)
Fuckin hurry.

Gale throws the phone down and tears off for Sidney.


INT. THEATRE  SAME
The theatre is big and old. Plush chairs, balcony, huge proscenium 
stage.

Sidney enters through a side house door. She pulls on it, releasing the 
emeregency lock. 
She makes her way down the aisle toward the orchestra section.

SIDNEY
Hello?

The stage is dark and bare with the exceptions of the furniture from 
the DEATHTRAP set. 
BUMP! A noise from the stage wings.

SIDNEY (contd)
Hallie?

Sidney moves down front to the little bridge that extends out over the 
orchestra pit. 
She crosses it and moves to stage center, peering into the wings on 
either side of her.

Complete darkness.

DRIP! DRIP!
Something drips down from above and onto Sidney. She wipes it from her 
face when...

CLICK! A spot light turns on from the back of the house, illuminating 
Sid center stage. She 
jumps at this, unnerved. She looks to her hand, covered in crimson. 
Then out to the house...the 
light is blinding.

CLANK! A NOISE from above..ropes, pulleys moving. Sid looks up as a set 
wall comes PLOWING 
down at her. She leaps out of the way, falling to the floor.

The wall falls into place on the stage. It is the back wall of the set 
thats dressed with 
framed pictures and antique weapons and...

DEWEY

who hangs from it, pinned up against the wall, very much deadk, arms 
outstretched, crucified. 
His body a bloody mess. Sidney stops, stunned. She stands frozen in 
unspeakable horror. 
Her entire being ripped apart. She breaks into tears. And then...

Sid backs up, moving, racing toward the wings when another wall flies 
in, sealing the backstage 
area off, trapping her. She looks in shock at...

HALLIE
strung up, her body hanging lifeless. Sid SCREAMS, turning, running to 
the other side of the 
stage when a third wall comes flying in, creating the three walled set 
of DEATHTRAP.
Attached to it, is the body of Joel. Dead. Blood everywhere. And then, 
Sid hears...

CLAPPING!
A single pair of hands from somewhere in the house...applauding. She 
turns around and spots a 
FIGURE moving down the aisle. She cant make out who it is.

Sid bolts. She spots the set door up center, near Deweys body. She 
goes for it, ripping it 
open to find...

COTTON WEARY STANDING IN THE DOORFRAME

Sid SCREAMS. But then sees his face, he looks scared. And then, 
Cottons body falls forward 
to the floor, his arms and legs bound by electric tape.

Sid turns back to the front of the stage. The Figure is now walking 
across the bridge, 
holding something...a light attached to a video camera. Shes being 
filmed. Sid looks back to 
Cotton who looks up to her with pleading eyes.

COTTON
Quick, untie me.

Sid is paniced. She doesnt know what to do. She leans down to untie 
him but stops.

VOICE (from behind video camera)
Youve seen this movie before, havent you?

Sidney looks to the voice. The camera is pulled away to reveal...

DEREK.

He smiles at her.

DEREK
Smile for the camera.

Sidney remains silent.

COTTON
Sid, cmon.

Side backs away from Cotton. She doesnt trust either one of them. 
Derek watches her, amused.

DEREK
Go on, untie him.

SIDNEY
No. This is a set up.

DEREK
Thats quick.

COTTON
Please, Sidney, hes going to kill us.

Derek begins filming again.

DEREK
You must be dealing with some serious trust issues right about now.

Sidney says nothing. She egdes away, moving to the wall where Hallie 
hangs.

DEREK (contd)
Sidney, you cant keep your back to the audience like that. Could you 
cheat a little forward 
for me?

COTTON
Please, Sidney.

DEREK
Youre really stumped, arent you? You know theres two killers but you 
dont know who they 
are. Im a given. The boyfriend. Way obvious. But now youre torn. 
Everyone else appears to be dead. Except for Cotton. Hmmm? Hmmm?

Suddenly, Hallie comes to life behind Sid, reaching out, grabbing her. 
Sid JUMPS. She spins 
around to find Hallie breaking out in a torrent of GIGGLES. Very much 
alive.

HALLIE
Paaaaiiin...yah, such pain... The story of your life, Sid.

Sidney stares in mortal shock as Hallie cuts herself down from the wall 
with a big hunting 
knife.

DEREK
Need some help, honey.

HALLIE
I got it..

Sidneys eyes go back and forth between the two.

DEREK
You should really see your face right now, Sid. Its doing some freaky 
shit.

Dereks right. Sids face appears completely tortured.

HALLIE
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.

DEREK
Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel 
of your life?

Sidney stares them down. Shes been here before.

SIDNEY
Why?

DEREK
Good question. You took the bait.

HALLIE
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole 
Mickey/Mallory-Woody 
Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.

DEREK
I really dont like that comparison, honey.

HALLIE
(to Sid) He hates Oliver Stone.

DEREK
I find his work overwrought.

Sid is waning.

HALLIE
Cmon, Sid, dont fade on us. Weve been planning this baby for a year. 
Humor us.

Sid turns to Cotton. She kneels down and begins to untie him.

DEREK
Nope. You had your chance.

Derek dummy lunges at her with the knife. Sid backs off.

CUT TO:

EXT. THEATRE  SAME
Gale approaches the side theatre door. She pulls on it. Its locked.

GALE
Shit.

She moves down along the theatre to another door.

CUT TO:

INT. THEATRE  A MINUTE LATER
Hallie and Derek move around Sid, taking turns filming her with the 
camera.

DEREK
We met on the internet.

HALLIE
He sent me the cutest e-mail.

DEREK
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell 
hopelessly. Hook, line...

HALLIE
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.

DEREK
Youd me amazed at how many of us there are out there. Its a whole 
world, Sid. 
Youre really popular amongst the demented.

HALLIE
Youre the one who got away.

DEREK
Until now.

COTTON
You guys are fucked.

HALLIE
Actually Cotton, and I think critics would agree, its the other way 
around.

DEREK
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?

SIDNEY
Youre not going to get away with this.

HALLIE
Of course not. Who wants to? Whats the point if we dont get caught? 
Wheres the glamour in 
that?

DEREK
The way I see it. Well be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home 
footage. 
Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide 
with the release of 
STAB II.

HALLIE
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.

DEREK
Were hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING 
swan song exit planned.

HALLIE
And now, drum roll please...

DEREK
Hope youre ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.

Cotton pull and twists on his bound wrists. Sid had loosened them 
somewhat. 
He tries to finish undoing them.

HALLIE
A twist ending if you will.

DEREK
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of 
the sequel. 
The Billy/Stu things been done.

HALLIE
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to 
far away from your 
orginal story you completely alienate the audience...

DEREK
And we didnt want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your moneys 
worth.

HALLIE
So we found a compromise.

DEREK
Or it found us.

HALLIE
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.

DEREK
Just for you, Sid.

HALLIE
Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip.

Derek reaches in his pocket for a coin.

DEREK
Oh yeah. (to Sid) We figure the one of us that actually kills you will 
get a little more press. 
Its been an ongoing discussion. (to Hallie) Heads or tails?

HALLIE
Tails.

He flips the coin.

DEREK
Shit! You win.

IN THE AUDITORIUM
Gale emerges from the lobby. She found a way in. She eyes the 
proceedings on stage. 
She sees Sidney standing over Cotton. And then Hallie and Derek on 
either side...knives in hand. 
She races down the aisle.

GALE
Sidney!

ON STAGE
They all turn, spotting Gale. Sid moves forward, happy to see her.

SIDNEY
Gale!

IN THE AUDITORIUM Gale moves down the aisle, not sure whats going on.

ON STAGE
Sidney moves down center. Derek cuts her off just as...

THE CURTAIN DROPS

Gale glimpsed the terror on Sidneys face just as the curtain separates 
them.

ON STAGE
Derek grabs Sidney, holding her, the knife at her throat.

HALLIE
Its about time she showed up.

IN THE AUDITORIUM
Gale moves to the exit door and into the...

INT. STAIR WELL  SAME
Gale eyes a door thats marked STAGE DOOR. She opens it and steps in 
coming face to face 
with a...

A LARGE AUTOMATIC REVOLVER

Gales eyes move down the end of the gun to find...

DEBBIE SALT
standing, lips pursed.

DEBBIE SALT
Hello, Gale, weve been waiting for you.

Gales face is a mass of confusion.

INT. STAGE  SAME
Derek releases Sidney, shoving her, she falls to her knees, next to 
Cotton. CLOSE on Cottons 
hand

SIDNEY
Okay, look, you guys--I applaud your methodical expertise but I have a 
question. Whats going 
to happen after I die? I thought the heroine is supposed to live.

HALLIE
Not this time.

Hallie moves in on her.

DEREK
Yeah, were trying to send a message to Hollywood. Im really getting 
tired of all the 
happy endings. Its just not reality. In the real world the good guys 
die, the innocent are 
punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.

SIDNEY
But nobody wants to see that. Itll never go. Theyll rewrite you. You 
dont want that.

HALLIE
Oh, Sid, youre sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one 
anxious.

SIDNEY
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..

VOICE
(off camera) Dont blame the movies, Sid. Movies dont create pyschos.

Sid stops dead in her tracks as these words still her very soul. The 
Voice comes from the 
wings. They all turn as Gale Weathers appears. Behind her, with gun in 
hand, is Debbie Salt. 
Derek grabs the camera. He doesnt want to miss a second.

DEBBIE SALT
Dont you know that by now? Its about family. It all starts at home. 
It starts with the 
father...and the mother.

Sidney mouth drops, her face aghast, as she looks to Debbie Salt. She 
recognizes her 
immediately.

SIDNEY
Mrs. Loomis?

Gale stops cold.

GALE
What?

SIDNEY
Oh my God.

Gale turns to Debbie Salt.

GALE
Jesus. It cant be.

HALLIE
Told you we had a guest star. Didnt see that coming, did you?

DEREK
Everythings taken on a hyper-reality, hasnt it?

GALE
Youre Billys mother?

DEBBIE SALT
I couldnt believe you didnt recognize me. You even interviewed me for 
your book.

GALE
Youre all in this together?

DEREK
We had to have financing.

HALLIE
Tuitions expensive.

SIDNEY
Why Mrs. Loomis?

DEBBIE SALT
Where should we start? Your mother ruined my marriage by sleeping with 
my husband. You ruined 
my family by killing my son. Gale aired it to the world. Should I go 
on...isnt that enough?

GALE
Jesus, youre just as whacked as your son.

DEBBIE SALT
Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you 
think incouraged him 
to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental 
guidance.

Sidney is completely horror stricken. She stands in total disbelief.

DEREK
Yeah, shes been great, Sid. We never would have been able to it 
without her.

Debbie Salt/Mrs. Loomis looks to both Derek and Hallie, smiling.

DEBBIE SALT
And I couldnt have done it without you two. Now who won the coin toss?

Hallie raises her hand.

HALLIE
I did.

Debbie points the gun at her, quickly, simply...and FIRES. Sid and Gale 
SCREAM as a bullet 
through the forehead sends Hallie flying back against the flat wall. 
Her body drops to 
the floor. Dead.

Derek drops the camera, completely taken back. He looks to Debbie.

DEREK
What are you...

Debbie turns the gun on him. FIRES AGAIN. Derek moves, the bullet 
catches him in the stomach. 
He drops  to his knees. Debbie FIRES again. Derek takes another bullet. 
This time dropping. 
Very dead. His body falls near Cotton who has remained suspiciously 
quiet through this ordeal. 
He eyes Dereks knife that now lay near his wrists.

SIDNEY AND GALE
turn to Debbie in complete horror.

DEBBIE SALT
Nice kids but a little out there.

GALE
What are you going to do?

DEBBIE SALT
Finish what my son started.

GALE
But youll never get away with it.

DEBBIE SALT
Enter Cotton Weary.

Cotton looks up.

DEBBIE SALT (contd)
Think about it. An innocent man wrongly accused. Spends time in prison 
where he justs sits 
with his righteous anger, waiting, planning his revenge. His life so 
incomprehensively ruined 
hes forced to take revenge on the people responsible. Its perfect.

COTTON
No...not again.

DEBBIE SALT
Sorry, Cotton. I guess you were just meant to be a killer.

SIDNEY
Youll never get away with this.

Debbie moves to Cotton, shrugging.

DEBBIE SALT
Who would you like to shoot first, Cotton?

Just then, Cotton leans up, freed from his bindings. With the knife in 
hand, he lunges for 
Debbie Salt. It strikes her, lodging into her chest. She goes back. 
Cotton doesnt stop, 
he stabs her again and again. She goes down. Dead.

GALE
Thank God.

Gale rushes to Cotton as he jumps to his feet. She helps him with the 
last of his bindings. 
Sid looks about at the body count on stage. Its mounting. She takes a 
deep breath. Relieved.

GALE (contd)
God, Cotton, what a nightmare. Im so sorry.

COTTON
Yeah...

Gale gives him a hug. CLOSE ON Cottons face.

GALE
Thank you.

He hugs her back. She doesnt see as he rises the knife behind her, 
bringing it down in 
one swift, maniacal move. Gales body jerks, a moment of shock and then 
she goes limp as 
the knife lodges in her back.

Sidney turns just in time to see Cotton toss Gales body down into the 
orchestra pit. 
He turns, facing Sidney. The bloody knife in hand.

SIDNEY
NOOO!

Cotton moves to Dereks body where the video camera lay, he pulls the 
tape from it.

COTTON
Its perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. Im 
the victim.

SIDNEY
Please, Cotton, dont do this.

He holds up the video cassette. Murder in his eye.

COTTON
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.

SIDNEY
Its over, Cotton.

COTTON
Not until youre dead.

Cotton lunges for her. Sid tears off, slipping through the set door 
to...

BACKSTAGE
Sid runs to the rear of the stage. She moves in the narrow space that 
exists between the scrim 
and the back wail. She races down it.

She almost reaches the end when

COTTON RIPS THROUGH THE SCRIM

Sidney ducks, bypassing him. She comes to the stage door. Its locked. 
She turns, seeing the 
metal ladder thats attached to the wall. It leads to the catwalk 
above. Sid goes for it. 
She climbs up the ladder with lightning speed.

Cotton, up and running, is close behind.

INT. CATWALK  SAME
The catwalk sits above the open fly space where flats and a large 
chandelier are stored in 
the air.

Sid reaches the top and takes off running down to the ending

AND THATS AS FAR AS I'VE GOTTEN.
WHAT HAPPENS IS SID AND COTTON FIGHT TO THE FINISH, HE CHASES HER 
THROUGH HANGING FLATS, 
THEN DOWN THE FLY RAIL, BACK TO THE STAGE. SID GETS FINDS A KNIFE AND 
STABS COTTON.

HE STABS HER BACK. THEY FIGHT, CONTINUING TO STAB EACH OTHER UNTIL THEY 
BOTH DROP CENTER STAGE. 
THEY LAY NEXT TO EACH OTHER, NEITHER ABLE TO MOVE. THEIR EYES SLOWLY 
CLOSE.

THE END (FOR NOW)

SCREAM 3

EHREN KRUGER

2nd DRAFT - REVISED

MAY 2, 1999

FADE IN:

A big dramatic crescendo as we --

								OPEN ON:

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - SUNSET - AERIAL

Friday night traffic as usual. Things appear to be backed up all the way to 
the valley. A cacophony of car horns rise up on the soundtrack as we slowly 
DISSOLVE INTO:

INT.  FORD EXPLORER - NIGHT

A new 99' Explorer sits in the midst of the gridlock. Behind the wheel is hot 
teen heartthrob and Hollywood everybody BEN DAMON. Ben is handsome, studly, in 
his early 20s. However, aside from being just another pretty face in the city 
of angels he's also a cocky, arrogant prick. Ben's in the middle of a heated 
argument on his cell with his Agent, Cathy.

				 BEN
				(into cell)
			God dammit Cathy I have no time for this crap!
			I'm supposed to be at the premiere of STAB 2 right
			Now, arm and arm with my girlfriend cause she's got
			a bit part in that over advertised piece of shit and
			I'm just going to humor her. You mena to tell me that
			in all your squandering the best you can do for me is
			A bit role in STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO?! Come on!
			It's just another cheap slasher flick! How dare you
			offer me such a role! I've done Shakespeare! I've
			worked with directors like DePalma and Scorcesse and
			you offer me this crap?! It's insulting. I should 
			fire you and go to ICM.

				CATHY(O.S.)
			   (off phone)
			Ben, I will not sit around and listen to you bad 
			mouth me! Without me you would've never gotten as
			famous as you are today. The least you can do is
			show me a little god damn respect.

				BEN
			   (into phone)
			You want Respect, Cathy? Here's your respect.
			FUCK YOU! You're fired.
			   (Ben hangs up)
			Unfucking believable.

Ben socks the steering wheel out of frustration. The horn blares 
uncomfortably.

				BEN
			Stab 3: Return To Woodsboro. 
			Pah. What's next, Friday The 13TH PART 15:
			JASON DOES BROADWAY?

Ben's phone rings. He answers it.
	
				BEN
			   (into phone)
			What's up, B.D. with the B.D.

				WOMAN'S VOICE
			   (off phone)
			Hardly as large as I'd like it to be.

				BEN
			Christine?

				CHRISTINE(O.S.)
			No, Jennifer Love Hewitt.
			Of course it's me, silly.
			And I feel like an ass standing
			in this theater lobby all by myself.
			Where are you babe, the movie starts
			in twenty minutes.

				BEN
			Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think
			there was some big accident. It could be
			a little while so I don't want you to start
			freaking if I don't get there at exactly,
				(checks watch)
			Eight thirty.

				CHRISTINE(O.S.)
			All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally
			p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.

				BEN
			   (putting up faux-enthusiasm)
			Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world.
			I bet you did such a great job.

				CHRISTINE(O.S.)
			I did. Hon, although I got a total of
			six minutes screen time, they're the
			best six minutes of the movie.

				 BEN
			Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are.
			Look, my battery's dying . . .
		
But of course, we notice Ben's battery is fine, he's just trying to cut the 
conversation short.

				CHRISTINE(O.S.)
			Alright Hon, talk to you when the lights go down.

Ben smiles.

				BEN
			 Sure thing.

Ben hangs up. He reclines back in his seat. Camera slowly pans out the 
windshield revealing the huge traffic pile up awaiting him. He's not going 
anywhere.

CLOSE ON GLOVE COMPARTMENT.

Ben opens the glove compartment. Papers scatter out. Ben reaches for a card.

CLOSE ON CARD -

A small white business card:   1-900-WET-4-COCK

Ben smiles, begins to dial out when suddenly, RING RING! The cell comes to 
life in his hand.

				BEN
			  (startled)
			Jesus.
			  (answers call)
			Hello?
	
				VOICE
			Hello.

				BEN
			Who is this?

				VOICE
			Who is this?

	At this point we know who the caller is. It's the nightmarish 	
	deep voice we've all come to know and hate from the first two	
	films. It's never sounded so evil. So sexy.


				BEN
			Well what number are you trying to reach?

				 VOICE
			 I don't know.

				 BEN
			I think you got the wrong number, buddy.

				 VOICE
			Do I?

				 BEN
			  (peeved)
			Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out.
			Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.

				VOICE
			Wait, wait. Don't hang up.

				BEN
			  (angrily)
			Asshole, Can't talk.

				VOICE
			But your voice sounds so familiar.

Ben smiles.

				BEN
			Does it now?


				VOICE
You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben 
Damon.

				 BEN
			   (smiling profusely)
			Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.

				 VOICE
			Really? You're such a talented actor.

				BEN
			  (loves the praise)
			Thanks.

			 VOICE
			Now let's see you act your way out of this one.

The voice seems to have changed tones. It now sounds a lot harsher, angrier if 
you will.

				 BEN
			What do you mean?

				 VOICE
			I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES 
			ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend 
			Christine is in there.  She's all alone. 
			Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film 
			to start.
			   (laughs coldly)
			I've got my knife.

*NOTE: At this point we intercut shots of the empty lobby and halls of the 
PLAZA THEATER. A POV shot standing outside the LADIES ROOM door.

				 BEN
			 (turning pale)
			Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?

				 VOICE
			More of a game really. 

				 BEN
			What kind of a game?

				 VOICE
			You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies.
			Here's how we play. I ask you a question. 
			You get it right, your girlfriend lives. 
			You answer wrong, she dies.

				 BEN
			I swear to God if you lay a finger on her 
			I'll fucking kill you!

				 VOICE
			Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. 
			First question, Your girlfriend's counting on 
			you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?

Ben groans. He bangs his head against the steering wheel, if only  he'd have 
paid attention to Christine he might have known this.


				 VOICE
			Come on. Don't you know?
		

				 BEN
				  (hesitating)
			It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character 
			she plays in the movie!

				 VOICE
			Very good. Now we play ROUND 2. 

				BEN
			What?! But I did everything you said to do!

				VOICE
			That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're 
			taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me 
			beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. 
			I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.

				BEN
			What?!

				VOICE
			Good bye Ben.
	
Click. The killer hangs up. Ben flips open the phone, dials 911. Ringing and 
then . . .

				RECORDED MESSAGE
			   (off phone)
			Due to the high volume of calls this evening,
			Dispatch is temporarily shut down. If this is
			not a real emergency please call another dep-

Ben hangs up, dials CHRISTINE's number. RINGING, then--

				 VOICE
			You're not playing by the rules Ben.
			Don't you want her to live?

				 BEN
			I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!

				 VOICE
			No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want
			you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out.
			Do you understand? 

IN THE B.G. we hear CHRISTINE's horrific screaming.

The killer hangs up. Ben looks ahead, traffic is picking up. He puts the SUV 
into gear, peels out the nearest opening, narrowly avoiding collision. His car 
screeches down the off ramp.

								 CUT TO:

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

Ben comes screeching around the corner in his FORD EXPLORER.  Tires smoking. 
Sparks flying. The HOLLYWOOD sign stands like an impending pall in the 
awaiting b.g.

								 CUT TO:


EXT.  HOLLYWOOD SIGN - NIGHT

The SUV comes to a screeching halt alongside the hilly, narrow road. Ben jumps 
out of his car, cell phone in hand. He looks up at the towering sign standing 
ahead of him, contemplates. Does he really wanna go up there? He looks into 
his SUV, gets an idea.

THE BACK --

--is opened. Ben reaches in looking for a weapon. AN OLD BEACH CHAIR. Not 
gonna do the trick. A pair of old shoes. Nope. Then he finds it, a LOUISVILLE 
SLUGGER with "ACTORS AT BAT FOR BRAIN CANCER" written across it. 

				BEN
			   (to himself)
			Thank God I decided to do some community service.

Ben takes the bat, closes up the back of the SUV. He begins to walk towards 
the sign when suddenly --

HIS CELL RINGS.

Ben answers the call.

				BEN
			  (into phone)
			Yeah.

				VOICE
			Very good. You follow directions well.
			Now for the final part of the game.
			Put down the bat and approach the sign,
			slowly.

Ben makes a disgusted face, tosses the bat into the bushes. He approaches the 
sign, keeping his eyes trained in all directions.

				BEN
			  (into phone)
			Where are you?

				VOICE
			Closer than you think.

				BEN
			  (into phone)
			Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want
			from me?

				VOICE
			To see your reaction.

				BEN
			Reaction to what?

Ben passes under the huge, pallid "H" in the sign. What seems at first like a 
gentle raindrop, beads down Ben's forehead. He rolls back his head, his legs 
turning to jelly, his eyes widening in horror.


				BEN
			OHMYGOD! NO!
			CHRISTINE --

Has been gutted from neck to groin. She has been fastened to the cross-bar in 
the "H" with heavy rope. Her lifeless body sways ever so gently in the 
Southern California wind. Utterly horrified, Ben staggers into the shadows, 
not seeing --

THE GHOST as he rises from the void, knife in hand.  In one quick, brutal 
stab, the knife is driven into Ben's spine. Ben screams as he's turned around, 
face to face with his attacker.

				BEN
			  (screaming)
			BUT I'M THE KILLER IN STAB 3!
		
				THE GHOST
			You just lost the role Ben.
			Consider this your parting gift.

AND WITH that, the GHOST drives the bloodstained knife into Ben's heart, 
causing a vicious eruption of crimson.

	TITLE CARD.   "SCREAM 3"

									OPEN ON:

	EXT.  TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT SET - DAY

GALE WEATHERS, the flashy thirty-something news anchor and author of the 
WOODSBORO MURDERS. She sits behind a desk on the really ditzy, loud set for 
TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT, an ET style program with a live studio audience.

				 GALE
			Good morning Hollywood. And today
			officially starts the Summer movie
			season. Opening the box office this
			week is Jeff Bridges and Tim Robins
			in Arlington Street,  Eugene Levy
			and Jason Biggs in American Pastry,
			and Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer
			in STAB 2, based off my best selling
			book the WINDSOR MURDERS. 

CAMERA pans across the audience. Many of them are dressed as the GHOST. A sea 
of white screaming faces. Very eerie and unsettling.

				 GALE
			Well I see a lot of the audience has dressed
			to the occasion. Today we have director of the
			upcoming STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO, Roman
			Bridger. Why don't we give Mr. Bridger a nice
			welcome to the set of Total Entertainment.
	
The crowd goes wild with applause and faux-knife slashes as ROMAN BRIDGER, 
ravishingly handsome, 29, tall and stocky, enters stage dressed in a flashy 
white suit. He sits down on a chair beside Gale's desk, places a STAB 3 coffee 
mug beside Gale's hand.

				ROMAN
			Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.

				GALE
			It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.

				ROMAN
			   (addressing audience)
			Well it's a honor to be here amongst so
			many fans of the genre. And I must say
			that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp,
			or Tori or David not returning to complete
			the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is
			here. Aided with my excellent cast of
			newcomers I believe we're going to pull
			off one of the best Stabs yet.

				GALE
			Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly
			seems that way.
				(a beat)
			Honestly though, 
				(smiles) 
			tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?

				ROMAN
			  (a long pause)
			Honestly, my life.

A eclectic hush falls over the crowd. Roman appears somewhat sinister in this 
light. Gale gazes deeply into Roman's eyes.

				GALE
			Your life?

				ROMAN
			Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with 
			those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like 
			I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick 
			your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to 
			a Tobe Hooper flick.

Roman smiles. The true costumed horror film buffs in the audience break into 
applause. Gale, somewhat distracted, other what not caring what this second 
rate director has to say, gazes at a costumed individual at the far corner of 
the set, watching from a half-open exit door. Now it could be just her 
imagination running away with her and her atmosphere but it almost appears as 
if the figure is pantomiming slitting his throat with a gleaming blade.

A LOUD BUZZING O.S.  Gale is startled out of her skin. She looks up at a sign 
hanging over the stage. THE WORD "COMMERCIAL BREAK" is illuminated in flashing 
red light. Gale sighs, looks back to the exit. The GHOST is gone. She turns to 
Roman.

				GALE
			Would you excuse me for a moment?

				ROMAN
			  (smiling)
			Sure.

Gale bolts for --

INT.  BACKSTAGE - TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT SET - DAY

Gale races around the corner of the set, smashing right into -

DETECTIVE MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D. Mid-thirties. Handsome with piercing eyes. He 
grabs Gale by her shoulders, shepherding her aside.

				GALE	
			Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
	
				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to 
			introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.
			  (flashes badge)
			Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, 
			or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?

				GALE
			Well I interviewed Damon once for the show.
			He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the 
			second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part 
			in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Both of them were found brutally murdered this 
			morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy 
			reports having come back to me yet but the 
			bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.  

				GALE
			So is that why you're here? Is that why you're 
			holding me from my show, to tell me about some 
			brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but 
			there's more. The killer left a note.

				GALE
			A note?

Detective Kincaid reaches into his back pocket, pulls up a newspaper clipping 
in a ziplock evidence bag. He holds the bag up For Gale to see.

EXTREMELY CLOSE on the ARTICLE . . . "MAUREEN PRESCOTT, MOTHER AND WIFE, FOUND 
BRUTALLY RAPED AND MURDERED IN BEDROOM". A b/w photo of Sidney's mother 
Maureen stands hauntingly before the camera.

				GALE(O.S.)
			That's Sidney Prescott's mother.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID(O.S.)
			There's more.

Kincaid flips the article over. Someone has scrawled in black marker across 
the back "SIDNEY".

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott,
			but she's keeping herself very well hidden.
			You're my one and only hope in finding her.
			Her life may be in grave danger.

				GALE
			I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being
			sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but
			I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor
			she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other
			person that might know is, 
			  (gale hesitates), 
			not going to talk.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			And who would that be?

							CUT TO:

EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS BACK LOT - DAY

A red BMW convertible speeds through the back lot. Behind the wheel is DEWEY 
RIELLY. Former Police Officer, turned Technical advisor on the red hot set of 
. . . STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO.

All around the lot are promotional banners and posters for the film. Dewey 
parks his car outside a soundstage, exits.

							CUT TO:

INT.  STAB 3 SET - DAY

A huge replication of Woodsboro in a building about the size of an airplane 
hanger.  In one corner we've got the Macher and Prescott homes. In another 
corner stands the infamous Becker house where the nightmare all began. In 
other regions are sights like the Town Square and Market, an exterior for the 
Woodsboro Police Station,  A TOP STORY news van, etc.

DEWEY, Enters set, bumping into his movie alter-ego --

TOM PRINZE, a Hollywood poster boy. Very cool. Not so debonair. A shoddy copy 
of Dewey at best. However, the conversation between the two is friendly, and 
they exchange greetings.

				TOM
			Hey Dew, did you hear?

				DEWEY
			No, what?

				TOM
			Somebody iced Ben Damon and his girlfriend.

				DEWEY
			That's Hollywood Tom. One day you're
			making movies in the hills, the next day 
			you're posing for the coroner downtown on a slab.

Dewey's obviously gotten a lot colder since the last film. He walks past a 
clique of STAB 3'S MAIN CAST:

There's:

SARAH DARLING: 30, playing a 25 year old bimbo. Very hot. Very blonde. Ample 
cleavage.

ANGELINA TYLER: 20. Extremely nave looking. She won her part in STAB 3 
playing Sidney through a phone in radio contest. She's timid, with short dark 
hair. Out of the entire cast, she is the closet to Sidney, they got.

And also the loveable

TYSON JACKSON: late 20's, African-American, all attitude.

The three flip through pages of the STAB 3 script, conversing freely about the 
production.

				 SARAH
			Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with
			these re-writes. It's like every five
			minutes there's a new script. God, and
			you just know this all because of STAB 2's
			script winding up on the internet two months
			after it wrapped shooting.

				TYSON
			And still the film is Number One at the box
			office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty
			and Arlington Street.

				ANGELINA
			I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.

				TYSON
			Nah I think it's doing so damn well because
			one of it's players got iced. I just hope
			none of us end up dead.

				ANGELINA
			Oh that's right. Those poor poor people.
			God Ben Damon was such a hottie.

				TYSON
				 (sighs)
			And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either
			but I'm really concerned about my safety 
			now.

				SARAH
			What are you talking about?
			The murders were a completely isolated
			incident.

				TYSON
			(reading from script)
			SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT.
			"What are you talking about Ricky, the
			murders were a completely isolated incident".

				SARAH
			Would you give that script a rest?	
			It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.

				TYSON
			I'm just saying, though. What if there's
			someone out there stalking actors? Huh?
			Then what?

				ANGELINA
			There's always someone out there stalking
			actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.

				TYSON
			Melinda McGraw?

				ANGELINA
			No, the other one. The one who played his
			wife. 

				SARAH
			I know who you're talking about. Rebecca
			something.

				ANGELINA
			Yeah I think. Anyway, point is, she had a stalker.
			Sonny Bono had a stalker. David Letterman had one
			too. So did Heather Langenkamp, Brooke Sheilds,
			Jody Foster, --

				TYSON
			Listen Miss ingnue, your cheering me up to much,
			Give it a break.

Tom walks into frame, sits down next to Angelina, subtly putting his arm 
around her. She shoves him away.

				TOM
			What? What'd I do? Relax your crack sweetheart
			I didn't rip those two fucks up last night.
			Jeez.
			   (lights up a smoke)
			So what are you doing tonight?

Totally repulsed, Angelina gets up, races off set.

				TOM
			Talk about moody.

Tom leans back seductively, his crotch in full view, staring at Sarah with 
bedroom eyes.

				TOM
			And how about you good looking?
			Got any plans for later?

				SARAH
			Eww yeah, finding a guy to have sex
			with that doesn't look like you.

Sarah, following suit laid by Angelina, scampers off set. Tom looks up at 
Tyson, smoke blowing out his nostrils.

				TYSON
			Oh no. I ain't into that shit.

Tyson races off set. Tom laughs, covers his face.

							  CUT TO:

DETECTIVE KINCAID AND GALE.

They walk through the set. Gale's mesmerized. Kincaid is all business.

				 GALE
			Dj vu-do.

The pair come to a halt on the driveway of what is supposed to be the Macher 
Residence. Everything from the smashed beer bottles in the garage, to the boat 
on the driveway is mimicked to a perfect t. Even a foam dummy Of TATUM RIELLY 
dangles from the doggy door, head squashed a bloody mess.

GALE stares at the swaying dummy, haunted.

				 VOICE(O.S.)
			Well well, someone dies and Gale Weathers
			comes running. What a shock.

GALE looks up. DEWEY stands beside her.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid.
			I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's
			Events?

				DEWEY
			Yeah. A real tragedy.

Dewey stares daggers through Gale. There is a real bitter coldness between the 
two.

				GALE
			Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, 
			this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.

				DEWEY
			What so you can just exploit her again with another
			book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.

				GALE
			  (to Kincaid)
			Show him.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Mr. Rielly, this was found alongside the bodies of 
			Ben and his girlfriend.

Kincaid hands Dewey the ziplocked clipping. Dewey examines it, his fear slowly 
growing.

				DEWEY
			I promised Sid I'd keep her in seclusion.
			I promised her nobody would ever find her.
			If you don't mind Detective, I'd like to
			approach her with this on my own and see
			what she'd like to do about it.

Kincaid nods.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else
			should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.

				DEWEY
			Understood.
			  (a beat)
			If you'll excuse me Detective.
			  (coldly)
			Gale.

Dewey walks off camera. Kincaid puts his hand on Gale's shoulder.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I'm going to have a little chat with the
			producers. Don't wander off. I may need you.

Gale nods as Kincaid disappears into the backdrop of the set. A Shrill voice 
O.S.

				WOMAN(O.S.)
			GALE WEATHERS! Oh my God!

Jennifer Jolie, an ambitious young starlet, playing GALE in the latest Stab, 
rushes towards her, with arms wide open. She's decked out in the flashy neon 
green ensemble Gale wore in the first film and even sports a fake shiner on 
her right eye. Gale is obviously pissed. She knows this actress and doesn't 
really want to be in her company very long.

				Gale
			Shit.

				Jennifer
			Listen, I know we've never met, and 
			I don't mind you never returning my calls, 
			but I have to tell you that after two films 
			I feel like I am in your mind.

				Gale
			Well, that would explain my constant headaches.  

				Jennifer
			  (defensively)
			You know I'm sorry that things didn't work out 
			on '60 Minutes II', but 'Total Entertainment' 
			that's a pretty good fall back.

				Gale
			Thank you.  I'm sorry that things didn't work out 
			with Brad Pitt, but being single, that's a pretty 
			good fall back.

				Jennifer
			Gives me more time for my work.  
			After all, Gale Weathers, you're such a complex 
			character.

				Gale
			And to be played by an actress with such 
			depth and range.  

Dewey steps back into the picture, cell phone in hand.

				Dewey
			No answer at Sid's. Where'd 
			the Detective go?

	
				JENNIFER
			   (excitedly)
			DEWEY!
	
Gale stares at the couple, just processing things in her head.

				Jennifer 
			  (fondles Dewey's butt)
			Gale, I think you'll really appreciate 
			my character work in this one, someone's 
			helped me understand the real you.

				Gale
			Someone?

				Jennifer
			The ruthless ambition, your private 
			self-loathing, and that lost and lonely 
			little girl inside.

				Gale
			Lost and lonely what?

				Jennifer
			You heard me. 
			  (takes Dewey's cellular) 
			Thanks Dewey.  I'll return it.

				Gale
			Lost and lonely what?

				Dewey
			Little girl inside.

				Gale
			I thought you were supposed to be in 
			Woodsboro!

				Dewey
			Well, I'm surprised you thought about me 
			at all.  Listen I gotta get back to 
			trying to get hold of Sid.
			Besides, she's more important than you ever were.

				Gale
			Wait! Dewey we can work on this together!
			As a team! Like in the past!

				Dewey
			No really Gale, that's a sweet offer, but this
			time I'd like to catch the killer before 
			the body count gets any higher.
			  (a beat)
			Toodles.

Dewey walks away leaving Gale alone. Kincaid enters frame, 	talking to two 
producers. The elder, sixty-five year old BUDDY SHAYNE, a towering, hefty man 
with gray hair. The second, bigwig horror producer JOHN MILTON, a creepy 
fifty-something with penetrating eyes and a menacing demeanor. The two talk, 
ignoring Gale the entire time.  She's almost eavesdropping on their 
conversation.

				MILTON
			I can assure you that security on the set
			will be at an all time high. Again, the
			deaths are sheer tragedy.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Well, I'd hate to see the production shut down.
				(laughs)
			I myself am a big STAB fan.

				BUDDY
			Really?
				(smiles)
			Have you ever thought about acting?
			You've got just the right face.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I am kind of dedicated to my job.
			Although I do enjoy taking acting
 			classes on my weekends. I grew up
			around these studios anyway. I know
			my way around. My Uncle was a screenwriter
			for PARAMOUNT.

				MILTON
			Really, what was his name?

Before Kincaid can finish, Gale buts in.

				GALE
			Excuse me Detective, I think we have some
			business to attend to.

				MILTON
			   (flabbergasted)
			GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here?
			No press on the set!
			   (to security)
			No press, no press on set!
			Get that woman out of here.

				SECURITY GAURD
			  (approaching)
			Yes, Mr. Milton.
			
				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			No, Mr. Milton, Miss Weathers is with me.

Milton nods his head, flags down the guard. He walks away.

				MILTON
			Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.

				GALE
			Oh come on! Why the hostility?

				MILTON
			Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and 
			all but last month I happened to catch 
			your little segment on me and how my wife 
			left me because I'm a sex addict who 
			enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. 
			It was a real eye opener my lawyers are 
			still thinking about bringing to your 
			superior's attentions.

				GALE
			  (shit-eating smile on her face)
			They're the ones who approved it.

Milton storms off camera, Buddy following close behind. Gale looks up at 
Kincaid.

				GALE
			Alright Kincaid, no where to?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I go to the police station and do my job,
			and you go back to being Gale Weathers.

				GALE
			Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, 
			give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.

Kincaid hands Gale his card, begins to walk out of the building.

				GALE
			Shit. Can I even get a ride home?

	INT.  SIDNEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

SIDNEY PRESCOTT, the stoic, survivor. Now 24, she lies peacefully in bed, her 
black lab PETE curled up in a ball at her feet. A noise startles the animal 
awake. It sets off the bed barking hysterically at --

THE BEDROOM WINDOW

SIDNEY --

--awakens. She squints her eyes to try and make out what her dog is going into 
conniptions over. Then she sees, and her face loses any trace of color.

MAUREEN PRESCOTT'S GHOSTLY WRAITH is pressed up against the window. She's 
wearing a tattered, blood soaked night shift.  Her voice is muted but her lips 
are moving as if trying torelay a message to Sidney. Sid's hysterical crying. 
She slidesoff her bed, makes her way towards the window when suddenly --

MAUREEN slides down the glass, as if being pulled by somethingbeneath the 
window sill. Something we don't see . . . yet.

				SIDNEY
				(crying)
			   Mom!

Left behind in her wake are five bloody streaks running downthe glass. The 
streaks begin to bleed, as if each wounds themselves. They bleed right through 
the glass. Sidneyreaches out to touch them when suddenly --

THE GHOST springs up behind the window, shatters the glass panewith his fist. 
SIDNEY screams --

AWAKENING IN BED FROM HER NIGHTMARE.

Her dog's barking wildly.

THE WINDOW is fine. 

SID crawls out of bed, disappearing out of the room.

								  CUT TO:


	INT. SID'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Sid's washing up at the sink. She wipes the tears from her eyes.She shuts off 
the running water, looks up into the mirror. Her demeanor definitely shows the 
ware and tear of all that's happened to her in her past. 

CLOSE on SIDNEY'S WRISTS.  Two ugly scars run up Sid's wrists.Battle Scars of 
a war waged between her own personal demons if you wish. Former Suicide 
Attempts former engraved on time.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  SID'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Sid's house is deep within the Napa Valley. Secluded amongst verdant vineyards 
and orchards that are now covered by thedarkness of night. A full moon hangs 
ominously in the sky above.
A light burns from within the two story farmhouse. A phone dialing out rises 
in pre-lap as we --

  CUT TO:

INT.  SID'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Sid sits in a cluttered office. On the wall hangs a poster forthe FALL OF TROY 
(her play from SCREAM 2) and a poster proclaiming WOMEN'S RIGHTS with 
CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S CRISIS center written beneath that.

A THREE-RING BINDER with a cover boasting CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S CRISIS CENTER is 
thrown open.

THE PHONE--

SID PUTS ON A HEADSET, dials a number. RINGING.

				SIDNEY
			   (into headset)
			This is Laura in Monterey reporting
			in for work.

				OPERATOR(O.S.)
			Alright Laura I'll patch you right 
			in to a call.

				SIDNEY
			Thanks.

A click. A woman's voice comes on the other line. It sounds very familiar.

				WOMAN(O.S.)
			Hello?

				SIDNEY
			Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor.
			How can I help you.

				WOMAN(O.S.)
			Laura I think I just killed somebody.

				SIDNEY
			Are you sure?

				WOMAN(O.S.)
			Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone!
			OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!

				SIDNEY
			Well then the people you need to call are the police.

				WOMAN(O.S.)
			No I need to call you. Just you.

				SIDNEY
			I'm sorry, your voice.

				WOMAN(O.S.)
			Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?
			  (a beat, Sid goes blank)
			Are you listening to me, huh?

				SIDNEY
			Who the fuck is this?

				WOMAN(O.S.)
			It's mother, Sidney, now be a good 
			girl and turn on the news. DO IT!

Sid reaches for the remote control, flips on a small TV lying across the 
office.

ON THE TV --

A REPORTER stands with the HOLLYWOOD SIGN in the b.g.

				REPORTER
			The mutilated bodies were discovered late 
			last night by the L.A.P.D, prominent actor 
			Ben Damon was slated for a role in the 
			upcoming STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO --

Sidney shuts off the TV as a familiar voice cuts through the din:

				VOICE
			Do you think it's over Sidney?
			Do you?

				SIDNEY
			W-what do you want?

				VOICE
			I want to finish what I started.
			I want to finish the game.

				SIDNEY
			You sick fuck I'm tracing this call
			as we speak! The police are gonna nail
			your ass!

				VOICE
			   (laughs coldly)
			Let them try. You'll never find me.
			I've already gotten away with murder before.
			For instance, Maureen Prescott.

				SIDNEY
			  (tears welling)
			No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis
			and Stu Macher did.

				VOICE
			Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think.
			It's all been building up to this Sid.
			Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of
			blood that's been spilled has all been
			leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.

				SIDNEY
			The final act? Well let's play asshole!

				VOICE
			No. We play in my court this time.
			Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting 
			corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set 
			on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.

The killer laughs coldly. Sidney wanes.

				SIDNEY
			  (crying)
			If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!

				VOICE
			Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you
			real soon Sidney. Real soon.

Click. The killer hangs up. Sid's left trembling. She rips the headset out of 
the phone, reaches into her desk for a loaded.38 special.  She stands up, and 
peers out her office window.

SIDNEY'S P.O.V. - THE DARK, OMINOUS NIGHT.

									 CUT TO:
EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS - NIGHT

Sarah Darling drives through the main gates in her porshe, rounds a corner.

EXT.  STAB 3 PRODUCTION OFFICES - NIGHT

Sarah parks outside the production offices, gets out of her car.

KILLER'S P.O.V - watching from the rooftop, Sarah approaching the dimly lit 
offices.

									 CUT TO:

INT.  STAB 3 PRODUCTION OFFICES - NIGHT

Sarah steps into the office. It's desolate. Silent. All over the place are 
promotional items (standees, posters, banners) for STABS 1-3. Sarah passes a 
big cardboard GHOST.

				SARAH
			STAB 3. Oh God I've gotta get myself 
			a better agent.

Sarah walks down a hallway.

				SARAH
			  (calling out)
			Anybody home?

Sarah passes Roman Bridger's office. It's half-open.

				SARAH
			Doubt that.
			  (door slams shut O.S.)
			Anyone here?


Sarah continues further down the hall when suddenly --

TYSON comes reeling out of a doorway, a huge knife jutting out his back, blood 
trickling down his mouth. Sarah lets out a bloodcurdling scream while Tyson 
breaks into hysterics.

				TYSON
			Stan! My man does great work.

Stan, a bearded, middle aged make-up effects guy steps out behind Tyson, slaps 
him a high-five.

				STAN
			Thank you. Thank you very much.

				SARAH
			Fuck you very much!
			Tyson go to hell!
			What the hell are you doing here?
			Where's Roman?

				TYSON
			Roman and everybody else went home for 
			the night. I'm here for a make-up test.

				SARAH
			Make-up. You need it.
			  (a beat)
			Hey, Roman isn't here?

				TYSON
			No.

				SARAH
			Damn. He called my roommate and told her 
			he had some important things he wanted to 
			go over with me in his office tonight.

				STAN
			  (jokingly)
			Yeah I bet.

Stan pantomimes the "blow job" gesture. Tyson laughs, slaps him another high-
five. Sarah makes a disgusted face as the two men leave the offices. Sarah 
sighs, ducks into Roman's office.

INT.  ROMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Roman's office is a clutter of old movie memorabilia. Sarah plops down behind 
Roman's desk, admires his old TRANSFORMER toys and two brass MUSIC VIDEO 
AWARDS. Sarah examines the award.

				SARAH
			   (reading inscription)
			For the honorary field of directing and 
			cinematography in music videos.
			How to the point. 

The phone rings scaring the shit out of Sarah. She drops the award, causing it 
to smash against the edge of the desk, snapping the head clean off. Sarah 
hesitates, answers the call, putting it on speaker phone.

				SARAH
			Oh shit.
			  (into phone)
			Hello? Director's office.

				ROMAN
			Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running 
			late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 
			minutes away.  

				SARAH
			Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at 
			your   music video awards.  

Sarah tries fixing the award with some scotch tape.


				ROMAN
			All right, since I got you on the phone, 
			let's talk about your character.

				SARAH
			What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who 
			gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes! 

				ROMAN
			You're not happy with your part.

				SARAH
			I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. 
			I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm 
			not happy that my character is too stupid not to 
			have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been 
			cut into McNuggets.

				ROMAN
			Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the 
			lines.

				SARAH
			Huh, fine.

				ROMAN
			Page 22, Candy's big moment.

				SARAH
			Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?

				ROMAN
			Hello.

				SARAH
			Who's this?

				ROMAN
			Who's this?

				SARAH
			This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some 
			clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have 
			to start the scene in the shower!  The whole 
			shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I 
			mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?

				ROMAN
			Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is 
			that like candy cane or candy apple?

				SARAH
			Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have 
			the wrong number.

				ROMAN
			But you know my favorite name? 

				SARAH
			I'm hanging up right now.

				ROMAN
			It's Sarah.

				SARAH
			Roman that's not the line.

				ROMAN
			It is in my script. 

				SARAH
			Has there been another goddamn rewrite?   
			How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our 
			lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes? 

				ROMAN
			It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.

				SARAH
			What?  What movie?

				ROMAN
			My movie.

A pause, then a familiar dark natured noise enters our ears, the killer's 
sinister voice.


				VOICE
			It's called, Sarah gets sliced like a 
			fucking pig.
			Still in character, Sarah?

Sarah tosses down the phone, bolts out of the office.

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Sarah stops in her tracks. Through the smoked glass of the front door she sees 
a shape approaching. She screams, spins around, runs for the prop room. 

INT.  PROP ROOM - NIGHT

Sarah locks the door, backs up right into --

AN ARMY OF GHOSTS!

AT LEAST THIRTY GHOST COSTUMES dangle from hooks on costume racks. Sarah 
catches her breath, dives into one of the racks.  She pulls up her cell phone, 
starts to dial.

INT.  STAB 3 - PRODUCTION OFFICES - NIGHT

A SECURITY GUARD opens the front door, pokes his head into the offices.

				SECURITY GUARD
			Mr. Bridger?

No answer. The guard nods, backs out of the offices, locking them with SARAH 
and the killer inside!

  CUT TO:

INT.  PROP ROOM - NIGHT

Sarah's waiting on eggs as a digitized pre-programmed commissarymenu for 
Sunrise Studios drags out.

				SARAH
			Shit.

Sarah momentarily glances behind her, just noticing, a pair of black work 
boots stepping off the costume rack. Before Sarah has a chance to scream, the 
ghost jumps down and shoves the rack hard sending a screaming Sarah into the 
next room. She goes flying out, slamming into a metal table covered with prop 
weapons.

THE GHOST --

Stomps into the second prop room, knife raised. Sarah leaps up, starts to 
chuck the prop knives at her attacker, screaming furiously.

THE PROP knives, hit the ghost, and bend as they bounce off his body and onto 
the floor. The killer shakes his head angrily, stalks towards his prey.

				SARAH
			  (screaming)
			No! No! Noooo!

The ghost drives his knife into Sarah's chest, once, twice, and delivers a 
final killing blow to her Adam's apple. She staggers forward. Her killer grabs 
her by her long buxom hair, and hucks her into a glass door.

THE DOOR EXPLODES, SARAH'S BODY falling through, shards of glass tearing out 
her back.

THE KILLER, stands in the shattered doorway, bloody knife in hand. An alarm 
resonates in the b.g. The killer wipes his knife clean, races off screen.

A NICE PSYCHO-ESQUE close up of the dead Sarah's eye as Blood swirls into the 
pupil.

   SHOCK CUT TO:

EXT.  HIGHWAY 39 -  N. CALIFORNIA - NIGHT

The highway is desolate. It's late. Sidney speeds into frame in her HONDA 
CIVIC.

  CUT TO:

INT.  HONDA CIVIC - NIGHT

Sidney's tapping her thumbs nervously against the steering wheel as an eerie 
song filters off the radio. The only light comes from the unsettling neon 
green digital clock/radio read-out. Sidney increases speed.

  CUT TO:

EXT.  HIGHWAY 39 -  N. CALIFORNIA - NIGHT

Sid passes up a road sign indicating LOS ANGELES - 64 MILES

  CUT TO:

EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS BACK LOT - NIGHT - EST.

The lot Is crawling with police vehicles.

  CUT TO:

INT.   STAB 3 PRODUCTION OFFICES - NIGHT

Kincaid and Gale stare at Sarah Darling's corpse as it's zippered up into a 
black rubber body bag and carried off by forensic technicians.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers.
			It looks like we're going to
			be getting a warrant to speak
			with Miss Prescott anyway.

				GALE
			Shit. Sarah Darling.
			   (a beat)
			I interviewed her too.
			God, it's happening again isn't it
			Detective?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Yes well we have a suspect, so don't
			get that worried.

Gale's eyes light up. She grabs Kincaid's shoulders.

				GALE
			Who?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I'm not at liberty to tell you that
			Miss Weathers. You're no longer working
			with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why
			you're standing in here right now. By
			all means I should have you thrown out.

				GALE
			But you won't. You're a good man detective.
			We think alike. I know you need my help.
			And I know you know I need your help.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			In my fifteen years as a homicide detective
			I've never met a single soul as pushy and
			brazen as you are Miss Weathers.

				GALE
			Please, call me Gale.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?

Gale smiles. DETECTIVE TOM WALLACE, Kincaid's cohort and partner. He's in his 
late thirties. Family man. Wallaceenters frame with a folder in his hands.

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			Mark, Bridger's in custody. We traced his
			phone records. He's the last person to
			speak to Sarah Darling before she died.
			Or at least call her home.

				GALE
			Wait a minute, Roman's your suspect?

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			Listen, Diane Sawyer, this here is classified 
			information. Why don't you go investigate 
			the bad meat at the A.P.
			This is police work, not Pulitzer material.

				GALE
			Hey, fuck off.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			No, cool it Wallace. She's working with me.

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			  (cocky)
				Well then. Looks like I'll go dust for
				finger prints with Barbara Walters.

Wallace arrogantly walks off camera. Gale looks at Kincaid.

				GALE
			So, what now?

CUT TO:

INT.  INTEROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

A frazzled Roman is seated at a long conference table while Wallace and 
Kincaid grill him with questions.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Mr. Bridger, you didn't tell us you spoke
			with Sarah Darling before she died.

				ROMAN
			That's because I didn't.

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			The guard said she was there for a meeting with you.

				ROMAN
			What meeting?

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			We talked to her roommate, too.  Says you called Sarah
			and told her to come down to the studio.  Roommate 
			answered the phone, says it was you.

				ROMAN
			Wait a minute!  I never called her! I never told 
			her to go   anywhere!

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Roommate says she knows your voice, Mr. Bridger.  

				ROMAN
			Well, she wasn't speaking with me!  Look, I did 
			not call   Sarah Darling!  

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Sarah Darling said you did.

				ROMAN
			Someone is trying to ruin my movie.  
			Someone wants to kill   my movie!

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			Hey, look at it this way, if anything this'll 
			be something interesting to put on the 
			director's commentary for when the film hits DVD.

				ROMAN
			  (dry laugh)
			 Ha! Too late, studio's shutting down production.
			 Called my film a risk! Do you believe this shit?
			 They're actually shelving my film because there's 
			been one ensie little murder. God, three people died 
			during the filming of The Exorcist.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Well I doubt they were stabbed to death and I 
			strongly doubt the killer of them left messages 
			on the scene for the police to find.

Camera pans through a two-way mirror into . . .

INT.  VIEWING ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

GALE AND DEWEY stand, gazing through the two-way mirror. Roman can't see them. 
They watch nervously.

				DEWEY
			They found another note?

				GALE
			Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one  
			about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or 
			not it looks like we're going to have to  go 
			back into our past.

				DEWEY
			You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid.
			This has nothing to do with you Gale.

				GALE
			This has everything to do with me Dewey.
			I was the one who brought the nation's  
			attention to this shit anyway. I'll be  
			damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass  
			on the buck again.

				DEWEY
			Do you really mean it this time Gale?

				GALE
			Yes. Look, let's get something straight  
			Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police  
			came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to  
			make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.

				DEWEY
			Why would the police come to you?

				GALE
			Again, I am the author of the definitive book on 
			the Woodsboro murders.!
			  (a beat)
			What about you?

				DEWEY
			What about me?

				GALE
			You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only 
			place that's real!'  But now you're here.  
			Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited 
			until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, 
			it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is 
			like seven everywhere else.

				DEWEY
			So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a 
			month? L.A Forever?

				GALE
			It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I
			could've been the next Diane Sawyer!

				DEWEY
			What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers?  
			I liked her! 

				GALE
			It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.

				DEWEY
			You used to say that was our strength.

				GALE
			Dewey, you're not just here because of  
			that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video 
			version of me, are you? 

				DEWEY
			Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not 
			About you.

				GALE
			All of what Dewey?  You do know something, 
			don't you?

				DEWEY
			Off the record.

				GALE
			Always.

				DEWEY
			Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a
			woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to 
			see the file on Sid, for research.

				GALE
			And?

				DEWEY
			The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name.  
			A month later, the station gets broken into, 
			the file room ransacked.

				GALE
			Someone stole Sid's file?

				DEWEY
			I already removed it.  I think someone on the 
			film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only 
			reason I came here. To make do a little 
			private investigating of my own and make sure no 
			one here was planning anything.

				GALE
			  (whips out cellular)
			I'm sorry, this is too good!

				DEWEY
			What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?

				GALE
			Right. Sorry.
			  (a beat)
			Do you think he did it?
			  (RE: ROMAN)

				DEWEY
			  (his beeper goes off)
			I've got my suspicions but still, 
			nothing  you say can ever make me take 
			my eyes off one person.

				GALE
			And who is that?

But Dewey doesn't answer. Again, he's staring daggers through Gale.  Years and 
years of bottled up resentment is finally surfacing.

				DEWEY
			Jennifer needs me.

				GALE
			Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?

				DEWEY
			I'm on duty.

Dewey races out the room. Gale pauses, stares at the interrogation. Wallace 
has reduced Roman to tears. It's pathetic. Gale bolts after Dewey.

CUT TO:

EXT.  SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - NIGHT

The wind rushes past the camera. A huge panoramic view of L.A.  FULL MOON 
hangs in the sky. A coyote howls in the near distance.

CUT TO:


EXT.  JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A nice low ranch tucked away in the valley. Dewey rolls up Jennifer's driveway 
in his truck. Gale follows behind in her VW JETTA.

				DEWEY
			  (noticing Gale)
			Stop following me.

				GALE
			I happen to work for the police god dammit!

				DEWEY
			You're not a detective.

				GALE
			Neither are you, Magnum P.I.

				DEWEY
			Gale, your engine's still running.

				GALE
			Fuck!

Dewey shakes his head in disgust, disappears into the house. Gale runs back to 
shut off her car. From out of the bushes lunges --

TOM PRINZE, loaded off his ass, still holding a half-filled bottle of JOHNNY 
WALKER BLACK LABEL SCOTCH in his hand.

				TOM
			Gale Weathers. What a surprise.

				GALE
			Tom Prinze, tanked as usual.
			That's a shocker.

				TOM
			Hey I really liked that piece you did on me
			last month. The one where you said my car
			accident was caused by me drinking and drugs,
			and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my
			insurance wouldn't sky rocket.

				GALE
			Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya.
			Stage the news to boost ratings.

				TOM
			Really, cause that stunt lost me the
			lead role in Roman Polanski's latest
			picture. Huh, what a coincide I was
			picked up by Roman Bridger. Well,
			not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get
			my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck,
			because of your big mouth I'm here,
			drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second
			rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer
			Jollie and yourself!
			  (a beat, subtle)
			Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should
			Have a look at your break line. That your
			car over there?

Gale pushes Tom's chest. Stopping him.

				GALE
			I think we should go inside. I have to have
			a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.

				TOM
			  (laughs)
			You mean what's left of us.
			  (tosses empty bottle aside)
			Yeah I'm running on empty anyways.
			Gotta refuel.

Tom and Gale walk into the house. Something stirs in the bushes.

 CUT TO:

INT.  JENNIFER JOLLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Gale and Tom enter. Jennifer is crying hysterically in Dewey's arms. She sees 
Gale, looks up with anger written all over her gaudy, over rouged face, her 
make-up running in a comical, almost homage to Mimi on the Drew Carey Show.

				JENNIFER
			You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!

				GALE
			Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? 
			What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those 
			USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly 
			you suck at acting?

				JENNIFER
			God damn you Gale Weathers! 
			Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his 
			victims as they die in the script!
			Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed.
			So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so 
			his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's 
			Candy, and now me!

				GALE
			Wait a second, whoa! Calm down!
			Number one there were five different 
			versions of the script given out.
			Ben Damon was given a fake script because 
			he was only being offered the role.
			It only had fragments of real scenes from the 
			actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?

Everyone is silent. Dewey nods his head. Gale rips the script from Jennifer's 
hands.

				GALE
			  (reading script)
			AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH!
			This is complete bullshit.
			Who wrote this piece of crap?

				JENNIFER
			I know right. It was kinda weak.
			That's cause Will Kennison only wrote 
			a rough treatment of it.
			The script was written by some new guy. 
			He wrote Arlington Street.

				GALE
			Still that was a much better movie,
			I saw it at the premiere last week.
			God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked 
			with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business.

A teary-eyed Angelina Tyler rises up from the couch, approaches the group.

				ANGELINA
			  (crying)
			What are you talking about?
			Because of this shit I'll probably never 
			act in a Hollywood film again.

Tom throws his arm around Angelina, squeezes her tightly.

				TOM
			Hey good looking, if you play your cards right, 
			I may be able to sit you down on my casting couch 
			and try you out for a few films my  production 
			company is working on.
			  (a beat)
			How do you feel about a DEEP THROAT remake?

Angelina squeals in disgust, elbows Tom, racing out of the house.  Tom groans, 
follows after her.

				TOM
			I'll be right back.

CUT TO:




EXT.   JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Tom walks out into the darkness, looks around. Angelina's nowherein sight.

				TOM
			  (calling out)
			Angelina! Hey! Where the hell are you?
			I was only playing! Hey look, I can really
			get you a bit part! Just come on out! Ok?
			  (pauses)
			Damn it. There goes my chances of getting
			some head from her.

 Tom whips out a joint, pops it in his mouth. He lights it, walks around the 
side of the house. A noise catches his attention.   A low, muffled squealing.

				TOM
			Aaaangelina?

Tom turns to a guest house. The door is half open, darkness  spilling out. Tom 
smirks, steps inside.

   CUT TO:

 INT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT

 The entire small interior of the GUEST HOUSE / DEWEY'S LIVING QUARTER'S IS 
BLACKENED BY THE NIGHT. Tom cockily waltzes about, not noticing one of the 
black shadows peeling off the wall.

IT'S THE GHOST!

				TOM
			Angelina?

 Tom stops in his tracks. He looks down. Lying in a pool of blood at his feet 
is ANGELINA TYLER! Tom screams, staggers backwards right into the arms of --

  THE GHOST --

				TOM
			You fucker!

 The GHOST slashes open Tom's arm. Tom screams, backs up into the kitchen. The 
ghost grabs him by the throat, begins choking him mid-air. He slowly begins to 
lift him off his feet, angling the knife, readying to make the kill blow. Tom 
gags. He can't even scream, the killer's crushing his voice-box, causing a  
trickle of blood down his lips.

				TOM
			  (gagging)
			Fucker!

THE GHOST brings the knife down, piercing Tom's heart, pinning him to the 
closet. Tom kicks around for a moment before finally going limp. The GHOST 
steps back, admiring his work.

  CUT TO:

INT.  JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Jennifer, Gale, and Dewey are pacing around nervously.

				JENNIFER
			Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?

				GALE
			 I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important 
			is that we stick together.
			 No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.

				DEWEY
			What about Sidney?

				JENNIFER
			What about her?

Suddenly, a knock at the door. The three are startled. Dewey looks at the 
front door.

				DEWEY
			Ssh. Maybe it's Tom or Angelina.
			I'll get it.

				JENNIFER
			What if it's the killer?

				GALE
			Oh use your brain drama queen!
			Do the killers ever knock on the fucking door? 
			Ever see Jason do that before burying an axe in 
			some big titted blonde's head? Or maybe Michael or 
			Chucky? Huh?

Jennifer sticks her tongue out at Gale. Dewey reaches into a holster tucked 
away under his jacket, drawing up his 9mm.

				DEWEY
			Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.

				GALE
			Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!

Dewey nods his head, slowly makes his way towards the door. Gale and Jennifer 
huddle together, follow close behind.

				JENNIFER
			Do you smell something?

				DEWEY
			  (smirking)
			It's Gale. She farts when she gets nervous.

Gale makes an angry face, slaps Dewey upside the back of his headplay fully. 
Dewey steps up to the front door. IT'S NOT LOCKED.  He reaches for the knob, 
turns it when suddenly --

THE POWER SIZZLES OUT!

EVERYONE SCREAMS!

				DEWEY
			Alright don't panic! Just a fuse.

Dewey throws open the door. ANGELINA'S CORPSE drops into the doorway. A 
SYMPHONY OF SCREAMS.

				DEWEY
			Hurry! Everyone out the back way! Now!

Dewey, Gale, and Jennifer race for the French doors in the living room leading 
outside to the pool and backyard. A PHONE RINGS somewhere in the house.

				GALE
			Who's phone?

				JENNIFER
			Oh shit it's my cell!

				DEWEY
			Answer it!

Jennifer answers her cellular.

				JENNIFER
			  (into phone)
			Hello?

				VOICE
			Hello Jennifer. Wanna play a little game?

				JENNIFER
			It's him! It's the killer!

 Gale rips the phone out of Jennifer's hands.

				GALE
			  (into phone)
			Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck
			do you want?

				JENNIFER
			What's your favorite scary movie Gale?

				GALE
			I dunno but I can tell you that your's
			will be the home video footage of me
			sticking my foot up your ass! Now come
			out and fight like a real man you pussy!

				GHOST(O.S.)
			I just might!

THE GHOST comes running out of closet, knife swinging wildly. Jennifer 
screams, races for the patio door. The ghost lunges for Gale. Dewey draws up 
his gun, fires.

BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The GHOST takes six slugs
In the chest.  He goes smashing through a coffee table, motionless. Dewey 
backs into Gale's arms, smoke rising fromthe muzzle of the gun.

				JENNIFER
			God damn it you two! Run! Hurry!
			He's dead!

				GALE
			No! He's not dead! He's still breathing!
			Look!

				DEWEY
			Gale he's dead. Come on. Let's get out
			of here.

Dewey turns Gale towards the patio door. A noise O.S. Dewey pauses, turns 
around --

THE GHOST IS GONE.

Dewey looks to the patio door.

SO IS JENNIFER.

				DEWEY
			OH. OH GOD. GALE --

				GALE
			What?

				DEWEY
			  (screaming)
			GALE BEHIND YOU!

The ghost barrels out from under the couch, knife raised. Dewey winds back, 
kicks a chair out in the Ghost's path. The ghost trips, goes crashing through 
the chair, coming smashing down onto the floor, knife burying into the 
hardwood. Dewey and Gale run for the patio when suddenly --

JENNIFER comes dodging out of the kitchen wielding a butcher knife.

				JENNIFER
			(screaming)
			DIE MOTHER FUCKER!
			DIE! DIE! DIE!

Jennifer slips on something, goes backflipping to the ground. Gale grabs her. 
Helps her up.

				GALE
			Come on!

THE GHOST comes to life, grabbing a lighter off an end table. He lights  a 
trail of gasoline, running from the floor to the kitchen (i.e. the smell 
Jennifer mentioned earlier and what she slipped on seconds ago). A HUGE flame 
trail lunges towards the two women. They scream.

				DEWEY
			OH SHIT! RUN!

CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD - JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Jennifer, Gale, and Dewey take off out the patio doors when suddenly KA-BOOM! 
THE WINDOWS BLOW OUT! THE ROOF SPLINTERS.

A HUGE CONFLAGRATION! The three dive into the swimming pool as debris rains 
down onto the Earth.

THE GHOST --

WATCHES FROM THE SHADOWS, FLAMES BOUNCING OFF HIS PALLID WHITE MASK.

SIRENS ARE HEARD IN THE NEAR DISTANCE.

AS THE GHOST RUNS OFF INTO THE NIGHT, HE DROPS ANOTHER NEWSPAPER CLIPPING ON 
THE GROUND. IT BLOWS IN THE WIND.

INT.  DETECTIVE KINCAID'S OFFICE - DAY

DETECTIVE KINCAID paces around his room. A battered and bruised Dewey and Gale 
sit beside his desk in Police Uniforms (since their old clothes has obviously 
been drenched).

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Whoever it is, now is taking credit 
			for Maureen Prescott's murder. 

				GALE
			But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, 
			Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they 
			even told Sidney how they did it!  

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in 
			your book that Sidney got it wrong before.  
			She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, 
			and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a 
			third killer.  Sidney Might know something 

Kincaid's eyes appear as if questioning Dewey.

				DEWEY
			I told you, I don't know where Sidney is.  
			And even if there was a third killer, 
			Sidney doesn't know about it.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley,
			she is a key element in this case.  I have a press 
conference 
			in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead 
			celebrities.

				GALE
			Four? There are five.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling.
			Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned 
			how to count.

				DEWEY
			What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Police are still searching through the debris.
			Could be days before we find her . . . that is,
			if she's even there.

Kincaid seems to be getting a morbid charge out of all of this. He smirks ever 
so nefariously at Dewey.

				GALE
			OK, look.  We all know that this has something to 
			do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the 
			killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Actually, there was more this time.
			This time, we found a picture too.

				DEWEY/GALE
			  (together)
			What?

Kincaid holds up a second ziplocked evidence bag. Within is a blurry 5x4 of 
MAUREEN PRESCOTT exiting a motel room with COTTON WEARY. Kincaid turns it 
over. Also, written on it's back is 'I KILLED HER'

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Before you jump to conclusions, the man in 
			the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country 
			on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's
			got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's
			supposedly the biggest thing down under since
			Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.

				DEWEY
			What does this have to do with Sid?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her
			own daughter?

				DEWEY
			Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he 
			was married to Maureen.

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			   (chiming in)
			What's your problem?  Last night you were almost 
			charcoal.  You gonna help us or what?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Do you wanna have this conversation with a polygraph?

				DEWEY
			Is that a threat, Detective?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			When it's a threat, you'll know it.

				DEWEY
			  (a beat)
			Is that a threat?

				GALE
			Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers 
			later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either 
			Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going 
			to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?

			Hi, you've reached the machine. Leave a message,

			Please pick up, I wanna make sure you're Okay.

			DEWEY!

The two run into each other's arms, embrace tightly.

				DEWEY
			What are you doing here? I told you to
			stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.

				SIDNEY
			Well it's not safe for me up there either.
			The killer found me Dewey. He called me
			last night.

				DEWEY
			What?

				SIDNEY
			I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up

				DEWEY
			There's someone here who wants to help.

				GALE
			Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.

				SIDNEY 
			Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.

For a change, instead of an exchange of fists, the two share a warm hug.

				GALE
			Thank you.

				DEWEY
			Sid, this is detective Kincaid.  

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Nice to finally meet you, Sidney. 

				DEWEY
			The killer called her.  

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			What?  When?

				GALE
			What'd he say?

				SIDNEY
			Oh, you know, the usual small talk, 
			"What's new, how ya been, how do you want 
			to die?"  

				DEWEY
			Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've 
			gotten your number?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			He could've monitored the calls on a scanner.  
			Did you call her from the set?  

				DEWEY
			No.

				GALE
			Do you have her number stored in your memory?
			  (Dewey thinks)
			Phone memory!

				DEWEY
			Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.

				GALE
			Has anyone else every used your phone?

				DEWEY
			Just Jennifer.  
			   (To Kincaid_) 
			And you.  


				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Hey, I'm the cop here.  You're in my office, Riley.

Sidney notices the clippings and the photograph of Maureen.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each
			murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo
			of your mother. 

				SIDNEY
			Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey.  
			Why didn't you say something?

				DEWEY
			I was afraid they were bait, something to, 
			ya know,  trick you out of hiding.  

				SIDNEY
			Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio
			where all this shit's going down.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Are you sure?

				SIDNEY
			Absolutely.

Kincaid and Dewey's cars drive through the lot. They drive over towards a row 
of trailers, park.

KINCAID disappears to do something else while GALE, DEWEY, and Sidney get out 
of Dewey's truck.

				DEWEY
			Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3

			Darling was murdered last night.

			Mm, what a waste of Silicone.

			What does my mother have to do with this

A figure lunges out of nowhere, startling all three of them. It's a young, 
scrawny goth girl in  heavy make-up.

This is KAREN COLCHECK, 22. She holds something in her hand, a video tape 
marked SCARY MOVIES 101.

				SIDNEY
			Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me!
			What are you doing here?

			That's me. First and Last. 

Sidney hugs Karen. So does Dewey.

				SIDNEY
			It's been a while? You still working 
			at Bradley's?

				KAREN
			Nope. They opened up a Hollywood Video

 WE ARE:

INT. TRAILER - STUDIO LOT - DAY

Sidney, Gale, Karen, and Dewey are gathered around the inside of the small, 
cramped trailer watching the tape. 

				SIDNEY
			 Oh MY god.

				RANDY
			Well, if you're watching this tape, it means 
			as I feared, I did not survive these killings 
			here at Windsor College.   Anyway, the reason 
			I am here is to help you, so that my death 
			will not be in vain.  That my life's work, will 
			help save some other poor soul from getting mutilated.  
			If this killer does come back, and he's for real, 
			there are a few things that you gotta remember.  
			Is this simply another sequel?  Well, if it is, same 
			rules apply.  But, here's the critical thing.  If you 
			find yourself dealing with an unexpected backstory, 
			and a preponderance of exposition,  then the sequel 
			rules do not apply.  Because you are not dealing 
			with a sequel, you are dealing with the concluding 
			chapter of a trilogy.

				DEWEY
			A trilogy?


				RANDY
			That's right.  It's a rarity in the horror field, 
			but it does exist, and it's a force to be reckoned 
			with, because true trilogies are all about going back 
			to the beginning and discovering something that wasn't 
			true from the get go.  'Godfather', 'Jedi', all revealed 
			something that we thought was true, that wasn't true.   So 
			if it is a trilogy you are dealing with, here are some 
			super trilogy rules.   One, you got a killer who's gonna be 
			super human.  Stabbing him won't work, shooting him 
			won't work, basically in the third one, you gotta 
			cryogenically freeze his head, decapitate him, or blow him 
			up.   Number two; anyone including the main character can 
			die.  This means you, Sid.  I'm sorry, it's the final 
			chapter.  It can be fuckin  'Reservoir Dogs' by the 
			time this thing is through.  Number three; the past 
			will come back to bite you in the ass!  Whatever you 
			think you know about the past, forget it.  The past is 
			not at rest, any sins you think were committed in 
			the past are about to break out and destroy you. NUMBER 
			FOUR,Never, ever under any circumstances go running off 
			by yourself, cause if Friday the 13th has taught us 
			anything, it's that the next time we're gonna see you, 
			you're gonna have a fence post jutting out from your 
			back. So in closing, let me say good luck, God Speed, 
			and for some of you, I'll see you soon, cause the rules 
			say, some of you ain't gonna make it.  I didn't, not 
			if you're watching this tape.

			Well can you tell me if the woman in this

Gale reaches into her pocket, slams down the picture of Sid's mom on Bianca's

				BIANCA
			Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those 
			files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?

			Well if you won't work for me, will you work

Gale slaps a twenty dollar bill on the desk. Bianca looks up, a bit insulted, 
slides the money back.

				BIANCA
			The president . . . of the studio.

				JENNIFER
			Twenty dollars? Who are you Nancy Drew?

Jennifer turns to Bianca, slides off her ring. She slams the ring onto the

			Go ahead. It's worth three grand easy.

INT.  LADIES ROOM - SOUNDSTAGE BUILDING - DAY

Sidney stands at the sink washing her face. She shuts off the water reaches 
for a paper towel when suddenly, something catches her ear. Almost as if a 
man's whisperedher name 'Siiiiiddney'. Sid turns around, stares at the empty 
bathroom.

				SIDNEY
			H-hello? Anyone there?

Silence. Sid reaches into her pocket book, draws out a Gravity Knife. She 
flips open the blade, crouches down on her knees, scanning the row of stalls 
for feet.
What a relief . . . none. Sid smiles, dismisses what she thought she heard 
when she sees --

THE RUMBLING AIR CONDITIONING UNIT.

Sidney goes back to drying her face when suddenly --

				MAN(O.S.)
			  (whisper)
			Sidney.

This time it's apparent. There's somebody else in the bathroom. Sid begins to 
make her way towards the bathroom door when suddenly --

WHAM! A STALL door flies open. THE GHOST charging out at full-force. Sid hits 
the deck, sliding across the floor, deflecting the blow from the knife as the 
killer buries it into the sink counter. Sid races for the door, killer hot on 
her trail. SUDDENLY --

WHAM! The storage closet door flies open and a second GHOST comes charging 
out, knife gleaming. He dives for Sid. Sid takes up her knife, buries it in 
her attacker's shoulder. The GHOST goes reeling back into the closet. Sidney 
slams the door closed on him. She dives for the door knob when suddenly, the 
first ghost comes running back at her. She ducks as he swings his knife, 
burying it into the bathroom door. Sid bolts across the bathroom towards a 
tiny window in the far corner of the ceiling. Using the trash as a booster, 
she leaps up, slides open the window, and dives out, just as the deadly pair 
of attackers come back for more.

CUT TO:

EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY

Sidney comes charging around the corner of the soundstage building. She looks 
up, realizing she's just ran herself into a dead end.

				SIDNEY
			  (crying)
			Shit.

BAM! An exit door flies open. The GHOST comes charging out. Sidney screams, 
runs for a wooden fence. She begins to scale it, dropping over on the other 
side just as the killer pierces through it with his knife. Sid takes off 
running for WALLACE and DEWEY.

WALLACE AND DEWEY,

HEARING THE SCREAMS, spin around, drawing out their guns.  Wallace looks at 
Dewey.

				DEWEY
			  (re:gun)
			Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.

				SIDNEY
			  (hysterical)
			Jesus Christ Dewey help me!
			They tried to kill me in the bathroom!
			The killers!

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			Wait a second? Killers? There's two
			of them now? Aw shit!

Wallace whips out his cellular, dials a number. Sidney falls into Dewey's 
arms, collapsing like a house of cards, crying hysterically.

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			  (into phone)
			Yeah this is Wallace. We got a problem   down 
			here on the Sunrise Studios lot.
			No not another one. At least not yet.
			Yeah we've had an attack.
			  (to Sid)
			Do you need medical assistance?
			  (Sid nods her head 'no')
			No. Oh really. Alright, see you in a minute.

 Wallace closes up his phone.

				DEWEY
			What?

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			Well I got some good news in a way.
			Roman Bridger didn't make those calls
			To Sarah Darling. Police let him go.
			Here's the bad news: The cellular was
			cloned, it's untraceable. We now have
			no suspects.

				GALE(O.S.)
			Dew!

Dewey and Sidney turn around to see an excited Jennifer   and Gale race into 
frame.

				GALE
			Sidney, what happened?

				DEWEY
			Nevermind, what'd you two find?


				GALE
			We did some researching in the archives.
			Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the
			book on your mother's murder. For two years
			of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically
			disappeared off the face of the Earth.

				SIDNEY
			What are you talking about?

				JENNIFER
			We've found out where she went.


				GALE
			She was an actress Sidney. Minor
			B-Movies. But now we have a new
			suspect in this twisted fucking
			web . . . John Milton.


				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			The head of the studio?


				GALE
			It makes sense doesn't it? It's his
			big grandiose swan song from the genre.
			What a better way to end than with a bloodbath?


				JENNIFER
			Sidney, what happened?


				SIDNEY
			I was attacked in the bathroom.


				DEWEY
			Wallace, shouldn't you be investigating
			the bathroom?


				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			  (looks at building)
			I'm waiting for back-up.
			I don't carry bullets in my
			gun unless I know I'm gonna use em.

 Dewey nods suspiciously.  Kincaid comes rushing into  frame.


				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened?
			I got a call on my cell from home.
			They told me that someone was attacked.

				DEWEY
			And what made you think it was Sidney?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			  (glaring)
			Sid, get in my car. You're coming   
			back to the station with me where it's   
			safe.

				GALE
			Dewey, Jennifer, I think we should pay     
			John Milton a little visit.

				DEWEY/JENNIFER
			  (together)
			Agreed.

  CUT TO:


INT.  JOHN MILTON'S OFFICE - DAY

Milton's on the phone with Roman.

				MILTON
			  (into phone)
			Roman I know you're upset. But there will
			be other movies. I know. Ah, VARIETY called
			you a Pariah? Well fuck them. I got a great
			script on my desk. It's called TRAGIC
			 MENAGE TRIOS and it was written by
			John Sayles. I'm thinking you for Director.
			What?
			  (knock at the door)
			Come in.
			  (into phone) 
			No, not to you Roman.
			Look I'll talk to you later. Bye.

Milton hangs up as Gale, Jennifer, and Dewey barge intohis office.

				DEWEY
			So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.

			MILTON
			Just what the hell do you people think
			you're doing, barging in here like this?
			I've got important calls to make. I run
			this studio.

				GALE
			Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?

				MILTON
			Who?

				JENNIFER
			Rina Reynolds.

				MILTON
			Do you know how many actors have worked
			for me? Hundreds, thousands. 

				GALE
			Nobody said she was an actor.

				JENNIFER
			Good twist.
 
				MILTON 
			What's your point?

				DEWEY
			No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.

				MILTON
			I remember her!  She was a bit player in a couple 
			of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter?

				JENNIFER
			Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story 
			of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and 
			you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!  

				GALE
			Settle down Beavis.
			  (to Milton)
			Why don't you tell us the truth?


				MILTON
			What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror 
			films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me 
			with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.  

				DEWEY
			But you know who she was.

				MILTON
			When we did the first 'Stab" I realized I'd 
			known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina.  
			I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press?  

				GALE
			And now? I mean, murders on your set and 
			still you say nothing?

				MILTON
			Get real, that would make me a suspect!

				GALE
			Just because you knew her?

				MILTON
			Yeah.

				GALE
			I don't think so!  Just what happened to 
			Maureen when she was in Hollywood?

				MILTON
			Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go.  
			It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller 
			out behind the barn and shot him in the head a 
			long time ago.

				GALE
			Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug
			up and drug all over National TV? Why don't
			you start talking.

				MILTON
			It was in the 70's, everything was different.  
			I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were.  
			It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get 
			them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing 
			happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or 
			another, no matter what she said afterwards.

				GALE
			Are you saying she was-

				MILTON
			I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they 
			did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth 
			is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges 
			were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds 
			wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in 
			Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.

INT.   DETECTIVE KINCAID'S OFFICE - DAY

Kincaid stands at his desk trying to put the pieces of this puzzle together. 
Sidney's seated beside him, staring at a stack of books on 'SCRIPT WRITING and 
SELLING YOUR WORK IN HOLLYWOOD'.

				SIDNEY
			What do you know about trilogies?  

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			You mean like, movie trilogies?

				SIDNEY
			You seem to like movies, Detective.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep 
			calling you Sidney.

				SIDNEY
			I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, 
			Detective.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, 
			all bets are off.

				SIDNEY
			  (noticing a huge file on her)
			Did you request this case?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal 
			with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my 
			way around the studios.  

				SIDNEY
			Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			To me Hollywood is about death.

				SIDNEY
			Excuse me?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you   
			see what I see day in and day out, the violence that 
			people do to each other, you get haunted.  
			I think you know about that.  

				SIDNEY
			What do you mean?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't  
			Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head,  
			whether you want to or not,  watching it alone. 

				SIDNEY
			Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop 
			being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, 
			you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, 
			Miss Prescott.

				SIDNEY
			Hmm.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			What did you know about your mother?

				SIDNEY
			I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect 
			family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a 
			secret life, and I tried to understand that, and 
			soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' 
			know who my mom was.
			  (a beat)
				Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my 
			mother for the first time. You know, with TV and 
			those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel 
			like I'm just learning about myself for the first 
			time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			  (a long beat)
			Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. 
			That's good news.

				SIDNEY
			How is that good news?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, 
			flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle 
			guys like that.

				SIDNEY
			Oh yeah, how?  

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Catch him, or kill him. 

Kincaid readies himself to leave. He snags up his holstered gun, his car keys, 
jacket, etc.

				SIDNEY
			Hey Detective?  What's your favorite scary movie?


Detective Kincaid pauses, he leans over Sidney's chair, his penetrating eyes 
glaring right into hers.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			  (sotto)
			My life.

Kincaid exits, door slamming shut behind him. A beat, then --

				SIDNEY
			Mine too.

CUT TO:

 INT.  RECEPTION AREA - MILTON'S OFFICE - SUNSET

Milton steps out of his office into his reception area.  Secretary's gone for 
the night. Milton starts out of the office, disappears. 

CLOSE ON A COAT CLOSET.

The door creaks open. Gale, Jennifer, and Dewey emerge from the darkness. 
Jennifer is gagging.

				JENNIFER
			Oh God Gale, Dewey was right.
			Stop getting so nervous and you
			might stop causing me to gag!

				DEWEY/GALE
			  (together)
			SHUT UP!

Jennifer's quiet.

				JENNIFER
			I think Milton's the killer.
			I think he just went out to kill another cast member.

				 GALE
			Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert.
			 He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack
			-off parties he has with his two best friends.

				JENNIFER
			 Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?

				GALE
			  (smacks her forehead out of frustration)
			Do you get any of my witty humor?
			I mean, you did play me for three movies.
			  (a beat)
			His two hands, dingus.

				DEWEY
			Ssh ladies.

Dewey leans into Milton's office door, slowly opens it. Darkness spills out. 
The three disappear inside it.

CUT TO:


INT.  HALLWAY - BUILDING - NIGHT

Milton's walking down the hallway. It's dark. Desolate. CAMERA tracks along 
the paisley velvet carpet as a phone rings O.S.

IT'S MILTON'S CELL. He answers it, pushes the elevator 'up' button anxiously.

				MILTON
			  (into phone)
			John Milton.

				VOICE
			Wanna play a game?

				MILTON
			Who is this?

				VOICE
			You tell me. You bankrolled three  movies about me.

				MILTON
			 It's you. The saboteur whose been fucking up my movie!
			  (a beat)
			 I swear to God if you don't stop I'll find you and 
			have you killed! I shut down production on that piece of 
			shit STAB 3! We had a no talent director and the 
			lousiest Sidney Prescott on the planet but that was 
			besides the point! You still killed MY movie! A John 
			Milton film! And if you ever try and cross me again you'll
			be sorry. My next movie is gonna be a grandiose step up 
			from this slasher shit! It's a film written and directed 
			by John Sayles.

Milton's going rapid fire.

				VOICE
			Oh poor John. There's not gonna be another film. 
			Well, at least not for you.


THE ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS with a ping. A flash of silver and in an instant, 
John's throat is slashed open, spilling blood. His corpse thuds to the ground. 
A pair of gloved hands drag him into the elevator. A moments pause and then--

THE GHOST storms out, disappearing down the hall.

THE ELEVATOR DOORS CLOSE ON MILTON'S CORPSE.

 CUT TO:

INT.  MILTON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Gale's trying to get a locked drawer on Milton's desk open. It won't budge. 
Dewey steps into frame, flashlight in hand. He shines the light down on the 
lock.

				DEWEY
			Hold on Gale, I'm a pro at this.

Dewey leans in, bumping his head with Gale's.

				GALE
			Oh Dewey I'm sorry.

The two look at each other and smile. Dewey laughs sweetly. Gale reaches up, 
rubs his head.

				GALE
			Here. Let me --

JENNIFER, chimes in. Clearly annoyed.

				JENNIFER
			Excuse me Gale! What the hell   
			do you think you're doing?

Gale and Dewey can't help gazing into each other's eyes. In an instant it 
almost seems as if a long lost love has been sparked back to life.

				DEWEY
			  (shaking it off)
			Let's get this drawer open.
			If it's locked, there must be something  
			inside he's trying to hide.

Dewey takes the butt of the flashlight, brings it down  hard on the locked 
drawer. The lock's smashed off.

				GALE
			Shit. That's gonna leave a mark.

Gale slides open the drawer, reaches in. She pulls up a manilla folder. Dewey 
shines the light on the folder as Gale opens it up and reads what's inside.

				JENNIFER
			What? What'd you find?

Gale's eyes widen.

				GALE
			Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never 
			going to believe who Milton's kid is. 

				DEWEY
			Who is it?

				JENNIFER
			  (nervously)
			Guys! I got a bad feeling.

				DEWEY/GALE
			  (angrily, together)
			NOT NOW!

				JENNIFER
			Guys there's someone else in the fucking room!

				DEWEY
			Huh?

Dewey and Gale look up and scream as --

THE GHOST rushes out of the shadows. Jennifer bolts for the door. The GHOST 
jams his knife in her back. She lets out a blood curdling death scream, drops 
to the floor motionless. GALE and DEWEY share a terrified scream. The killer 
wipes his blade clean, lunges for them.

				DEWEY
			  (frantic)
			Gale run!

Dewey jumps in the killer's path. The killer winds back, cracks the base of 
the knife across Dewey's skull. Dewey drops to the floor unmoving.

				GALE
			  (screaming)
			Dewey!

CLANG! The Killer's blade glistens in the moonlight. He charges for Gale. Gale 
screams, races out of the office door, slamming it closed on the killer 
sending him flying onto his back.

  CUT TO:

INT.  HALLWAY - OFFICES - NIGHT

Gale races down the hallway, frantically trying every door she passes. All of 
them locked. She reaches the elevator, hits the "down" button.  The door opens 
with a ping. Gale unleashes a horrendous scream --

MILTON --

--has been strung up from the ceiling ventilation duct, gutted from knob to 
gullet. His entrails lie in steaming heaps at his feet. 

GALE staggers away from the elevator, speechless. She screams again.

HER GHOSTLY ATTACKER is coming straight for her.

GALE fakes out the killer, dives into the elevator. He runs ahead, briefly, 
giving Gale enough time to trip him sending him landing flat on his face. Gale 
races out of the elevator doubles back down the hallway towards a door marked 
"stairs". She bolts through the door. 

 CUT TO:

INT.  STAIRWELL - OFFICES - NIGHT

Gale races down the stairs, nearly tripping and falling. She races out onto 
the ground floor.

 CUT TO:

EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIO LOT - NIGHT

Gale races out of the office building. A car horn blares. She screams.

KINCAID jams on his breaks, gets out his car. He draws up his gun.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Jesus Gale what happened?

				GALE
			  (frantic)
			He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!
			  (realizing)
			DEWEY! Dewey's in there too!
			He needs medical help!
			He's hurt!

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Alright, calm down. I'm going  
			to radio in for backup right now.

				VOICE(O.S.)
			Not so fast. We're not finished.

Kincaid spins around. Gale screams. The GHOST comes charging out of nowhere, 
slashes open Kincaid's throat, stabs him in the chest. Kincaid drops onto the 
hood of his car, dead.

GALE pauses. She's screaming hysterically. The killer raises the knife 
menacingly.

				VOICE
			I wouldn't run if I were you Gale.
			It's only gonna end up with you getting
			Skewered like a fucking pig. I need you.

				GALE
			  (nervously)
			Awfully late time to be doing an interview.

				VOICE
			I need you as bait. For Sidney.

Gale closes her eyes, cries as the killer stalks towards her.

  CUT TO:

INT.  DETECTIVE KINCAID'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Sidney sits in Kincaid's office flipping through the folder marked 'SIDNEY 
PRESCOTT' It's loaded with newspaper articles and police reports and is 
basically a scrapbook of obsession. Sidney smirks. Kincaid has drawn little 
magic marker hearts around a picture of her. She's awakened from her daydream. 
The phone rings. Sid answers it.  

				SIDNEY
			  (into phone)
			Hello?

				SIDNEY'S VOICE(O.S.)
			  (off phone)
			Hello?

				SIDNEY
			Who is this?

			Um wh-who's calling?

				PHONE SIDNEY(O.S.)
			Um wh-who's calling?

				SIDNEY
			Gale, Dewey, whoever, um, call me back, 
			I can only hear myself.

				VOICE
			  { a click }  
			I only her you too, Sidney. 

				SIDNEY
			Who is this?

				VOICE
			The question isn't who I am.  The question is, 
			who's with me. 

				GALE
			  (screaming)
			Sidney, stay away!

Sid's face floods with fear. She rushes towards the office door when suddenly, 
the voice draws her back, angrily and cautioning.

				VOICE
			Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract 
			attention, one thing, I'll kill them both.   
			Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?

				SIDNEY
			Yes.

				VOICE
			Go there.

Sidney stands up, goes into an inner office, Wallace's.

				VOICE
			Always hard being friends with you, Sidney.  
			When you're friends with Sidney, you die!  
			Well these friends don't have to, Sidney.  
			It's up to you.  

				SIDNEY
			How do I know their voices are --

				VOICE
			Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things?  
			How do you know I'm not someone in your head?  
			Somewhere, you know.  

				DEWEY
			  (frantic)
			Don't come here Sidney!  

We hear the killer haul back and hit Dewey hard.

				GALE
			Dewey! No!

				VOICE
			Or do you?  

				SIDNEY
			You're dead!

				VOICE
			I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. 
			You show yourself, they survive, you run, 
			they die! 

				GALE
			Oh God!  Oh God!

				VOICE
			Don't you want to know Sidney? Don't you want to 
			know who killed her?  Don't you want to know who 
			killed your mother? 

				COP(O.S.)
			Have you seen Kincaid?

				 COP 2(O.S.)
			NO.  But Wallace is around.

				SIDNEY
			Where?

				VOICE
			She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.

				SIDNEY
			WHERE?

				VOICE
			I'll call you, when you're on your way.  

Click. The killer hangs up. Sidney breaks down crying.

				SIDNEY
			Fuck!

Wallace's keys rest on his desk. Sid ponders, takes them. She stands up when 
something inside her makes her open Wallace's drawer and dig around. She pulls 
up a fully loaded handgun.

That's the ticket. She closes the drawer, slinks out the side exit.

  CUT TO:

INT.  WALLACE'S CAR - NIGHT

Sid speeds through rain-slicked streets. Her cellular rings.

				SIDNEY
			  (into phone)
			Yeah?

				VOICE
			You follow directions good.
			Now let's wrap this production.
			Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot.
			I'll call you when you get there.

Click. The killer hangs up.

   CUT TO:


EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS LOT - NIGHT

Sid parks Wallace's car alongside the studio gates. She gets out, stands on 
the hood of the car, begins to scale the wrought-iron fence.

     CUT TO:

EXT.  SOUNDSTAGE - STUDIO LOT - NIGHT

Sidney creeps through the darkened, abandon lot. Again, her cellular rings. 
Again, she answers it.

				SIDNEY
			  (into phone)
			Alright, I'm here. Now what?

				VOICE
			You're doing real good. Can't
			you figure it out? I wanna finish
			this where it all began. Woodsboro.

				SIDNEY
			I thought you wanted me here?

Click the killer hangs up. Sid pockets her phone. She looks up, and is 
startled out of fright.  Posted alongside the sound stageis a huge production 
poster for STAB 3 with a life-size GHOST wielding a big knife. Sid knows she's 
in the right place. The door leading inside is half-open. Sid taps the 
holstered gun, slowly steps into the darkness.

  CUT TO:

INT.  STAB 3 SETS - NIGHT

Sidney enters. She pauses. As a million things rush through her mind. To her 
this is like the ultimate return. Everything appears as she last remembers. 
Sid steps through the dark sets. Her phone rings. She answers it.

				SIDNEY
			  (into phone)
			Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can 
			finish this.

				VOICE
			It's good to see you again Sidney.
			I was growing real impatient.
			Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.

The killer hangs up. Sid pockets the phone. She walks past the MACHER GARAGE 
set. Instead of a foam TATUM body dangling from the doggy door, it's KINCAID'S 
CORPSE! Sidney flinches, covers her eyes. She walks on.

INT.  BECKER HOUSE - SET - NIGHT

Sid steps through the living room of the BECKER set. It mirrors the house 
perfectly. Everything from the shattered patio door to the burnt Jiffy Pop is 
there. Sid's phone rings. She answers it.

				SIDNEY
			Yeah?

				DEWEY(O.S.)
			  (off phone)
			Help me Sid! The killer's got me!

				 SIDNEY
			Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!

				DEWEY(O.S.)
			Sid I can see you!

				SIDNEY
			Where are you Dewey?

				DEWEY(O.S.)
			I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid!
			The killer's looking for you!
			Quick untie me!

Sid bolts through the shattered patio door out onto the backyard set. Seated 
before a heated in ground pool, tied to a patio chair, beaten and gagged, is 
DEWEY RIELLY. He's unconscious and almost appears at first glance like STEVEN 
ORTH from SCREAM. Sid's jaw drops. This can't be possible. She looks down at 
the phone.

				DEWEY(O.S.)
			Good work Sid. 

Sid screams, dropping the phone out of fright. She turns around coming face to 
face with --

THE GHOST 

HE STANDS in the patio doorway. A monstrous version of the voice-changing box 
in hand. He raises up the box, clicks a button and speaks.

				GHOST
			  (Sid's voice)
			You play a good game Sidney.
			Now it's time to get down to business.

				SIDNEY
			Who are you?

				GHOST
			  (click-now he's Maureen's voice)
			Your other half.

 The GHOST rushes Sid. She screams, takes off running. She bolts across the 
darkened set, running straight up the front porch of a mock-up of her own 
childhood home. She swings open the front door, slams it closed. 

INT.  PRESCOTT HOUSE - SET - NIGHT

Sid locks and bolts the front door. She backs away from it as the killer 
begins to pounce against it, struggling to get inside. Sid hears something 
upstairs. Like muffled cries. She races up to investigate.

CUT TO:

INT.  SIDNEY'S BEDROOM - SET - NIGHT

Sid enters the set of her bedroom, slowly drawing out the gun she stole from 
Kincaid's office.

LYING on the bed, bound and gagged, is --

GALE WEATHERS

				SIDNEY
			GALE!

Sid races over, removes the gag from Gale's mouth.

				GALE
			Christ Sidney hurry up!
			That fucking lunatic is coming!

Sid fumbles with the bindings, manages to untie Gale. Gale sits up.

				SIDNEY
			Gale he's got Dewey!

				GALE
			I know! He killed Kincaid!

				SIDNEY
			I know!

				GALE
			Let's get out of here!

				SIDNEY
			   (screaming)
			GALE WATCHOUT!

KER-SMASH! The GHOST launches himself through the upstairs window. Gale and 
Sidney bolt for the bedroom door, killer hot on their tails.

 CUT TO:

DEWEY --

Dewey comes around. He lets his head loll for a moment before finally 
beginning to pull and tug on his bindings.

EXTREMELY CLOSE on Dewey freeing one of his hands from the heavy duct tape.

 CUT TO:

INT.  MAUREEN'S BEDROOM - PRESCOTT HOUSE SET - NIGHT

Gale and Sidney run into the master bedroom set, slamming the door shut and 
locking it. Sid looks around, her head already swimming from the chaos 
outside. However, what's inside utterly horrifies her. The walls, the 
furniture and the bed are splattered with blood. On the bed lies a corpse in a 
black rubber body bag (supposedly Maureen's body). The door buckles under the 
killer's blows. Gale and Sidney scream. They can't hold out much longer.

				GALE
			Jesus Christ Sidney get out of here!
			He can't get us both!

A knife splinters through the door, inches from Gale's face. She screams.

				GALE
			RUNNN!

Sid backs away, hysterical. She raises up the gun, fires into the door.  BLAM! 
BLAM! BLAM! Gale ducks out of the way. Silence.
The door ceases to move. AND THEN --

THE BODY BAG UNZIPS and the second GHOST emerges, knife in hand. The girls 
utter horrified screams. Sid raises up the gun, goes to fire when suddenly --

BAM!

The bedroom door's kicked down and the other killer enters, grabbing Sid by 
her shoulders, batting the gun from her hands.

Sid screams, punches her attacker in the chest. He winces.

The second Ghost grabs Gale, holds the knife to her throat, stopping her in 
her tracks. Sid makes a beeline for the window, leaps through the glass.

THE WINDOW SHATTERS.

Sid comes flying out onto the patio awning. She rolls over onto the astro-turf 
grass, momentarily motionless. And then she comes to. Her eyes flickering 
open, blurrily staring up at --

THE GHOST, leering out the shattered window frame.

SID stands up, takes off running towards --

THE MACHER HOUSE SET.

   CUT TO:

INT.  FOYER - MACHER HOUSE SET - NIGHT

Sid races into the foyer, slams the door closed behind her. Again, locking and 
bolting it. She looks around, everything is once again the same as it was in 
Woodsboro. This is where the climax of the original battle between good and 
evil wasfought. It's dj vu all over again.  Footsteps O.S.

				DEWEY(O.S.)
			  (weakly)
			Sidney?

Sidney turns around --

DEWEY staggers through the living room doorway, gun in hand.

				SIDNEY
			  (eyes lighting up)
			Dewey!

Sidney embraces Dewey.

				DEWEY
			Where's Gale?

				SIDNEY
			They've got her!

				DEWEY
			Sid I want you to stay here!
			I'll be right back!
			I'm not gonna let them get Gale!

Dewey unlocks the front door, swings it open.

STANDING across the set is THE GHOST, knife raised.

				DEWEY
			  (tightening grip on gun)
			 Hold it right there you fucker!

Dewey goes to fire. CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. Out of bullets.

				DEWEY
			  (nervously)
			OH shit!

THE GHOST winds back, launches the knife. It swirls through space before 
embedding into Dewey's arm, launching him back through the doorway. Sidney 
screams. Dewey's unconscious again. The GHOST races for the open door. Sid 
screams, kicks it closed. Locking and bolting it again. A crash O.S. Sid turns 
around --

A BODY rolls down the staircase, covered in blood. It comes to a halt at 
Sidney's feet, an unmoving, rumpled figure.

IT'S ANGELINA TYLER.

She's been brutally stabbed.

				SIDNEY
			  (crying)
			Oh God.

BUT ANGELINA'S EYES OPEN. A SICK RICTUS SMILE FORMING on her lips.She pulls 
out a gun, aims it at Sidney's face.

				ANGELINA
			Time to sort things out.
			Whatta you say?

CUT TO:

INT.  MACHER LIVING ROOM - SET - NIGHT

Angelina walks Sidney into the living room at gunpoint. Gale's been handcuffed 
and tossed onto the couch.

ON THE TV --

HOME VIDEO FOOTAGE of MAUREEN PRESCOTT plays.

				SIDNEY
			It's you?! All of this is because of you?

				ANGELINA
			No. Not all of it. Sid, someone really  
			wants to meet you.  

Sid tries to run, Angelina trains the gun on her. Causing her to stop in her 
tracks.

				ANGELINA
			Uh-un Sid. You're not gonna run off.
			Not now.

				VOICE(O.S.)
			You're not going anywhere Sidney.
			It's time you came to terms with me, and with  
			mother! Maybe you never knew her at all, Sid.
			Maybe you can't get past the surface of things.

The GHOST enters frame, ripping open his costume to reveal a KEVLAR bullet 
proof vest.

				SIDNEY
			Who the hell are you?

				THE GHOST
			The other half of you! I searched for a mother too, 
			an actress named Rina Reynolds. I tried to find her 
			my whole life. And four years ago I actually tracked 
			her down, knocked on her door, thinking she'd welcome 
			me back with open arms, but she had a new life and a 
			new name, Maureen Prescott! You were the only 
			child she claimed Sidney. She shut me out in the cold 
			forever, her own son!

THE GHOST rips off his mask. IT'S ROMAN. Sidney's deathly quiet.

				ROMAN 
			 Roman Bridger, director. And brother.
			  (a beat)
			She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was 
			Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, 
			what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little 
			home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, 
			mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one 
			thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, 
			that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing 
			his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And 
			once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was 
			a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case 
			you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like 
			her was making a movie.

				SIDNEY
			All the nightmares. All the hell I went through 
			was because of you, you spineless bastard!

				ROMAN
			I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, 
			Angelina over there,
			  (Angelina smiles)
			She's my partner. I can convince her to do 
			anything.  We've been dating since I met her in 
			Woodsboro.

				SIDNEY
			  (dryly)
			Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?

				ANGELINA
			That's me Sid. I always idolized you. You
			were always my hero. That's why I'm here Sidney. 
			I wanted to make you proud.

				ROMAN
			And I kinda keep her around cause it's a bit of
			a turn-on. You know, in the movies she's you Sid, so every
			time I jump her bones, I'm doing YOU, technically.

				SIDNEY
			   (repulsed)
			Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit 
			before! So lets get on with it!

				ROMAN
			Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun.
			You haven't seen the best part.
			  (pulls out tape recorder)
			With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've 
			been able to steal your voice.
			  (presses play)
			Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna 
			find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.

				SIDNEY
			   (off tape recorder)
			I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation
			of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to 
			make you all repent for your sins, and now
			I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.

Sid squirms.

				ROMAN
			   (clicking off tape recorder)
			Awesome. What'd I tell ya? Heh. Did youknow that 
			John Milton, was my daddy?
			Yep, he's the one who fucked mommy dearest in the long run.
			 His parties, his flings, exploited the Hollywood nobody!
			That's whyI had to make him pay. Daddy dearest is dead.
			Mommy's dead. Looks like I'm an orphan all alone
			in this world. What a good reason to --
			STAB MYSELF!

Roman stabs himself in the arm. He screams, goes stagger back into Angelina's 
arms.

				ROMAN
			See Sidney, as amateur as Billy and Stu were,
			they laid the groundwork for this! See Sidney,
			they also set the stage for you! Introducing
			to the world Sidney the victim! Sidney the
			survivor! Sidney the star!

Roman continues stabbing himself. In the shoulder. In the side.In the leg. 
Bleeding and hazed, he hands the gore drenched knife to Angelina.

				ROMAN
			See Sid, now comes the part where we get away
			with it! The part where we win! Cause face it
			Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!

				SIDNEY
			Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you
			kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and
			not because of any other fucking reason!

				ANGELINA
			  (screaming)
			Roman make her stop! Make her stop baby she's
			freaking me out!

				ROMAN
			   (screaming)
			God damn it Sidney!

Roman lunges at Sidney. Sid screams, takes off through the kitchen. Gale rolls 
herself off the couch. Angela runs over and kicks her in the ribs. 

				GALE
			  (coughing)
			Hey bitch, don't ever use prop cuffs to restrain 
			Gale Weathers.

Gale pops off the handcuffs.

				GALE
			  (leaping up)
			I know all the tricks!

Gale barrels into Angelina, tackling her into the coffee table before she has 
a chance to move. Angelina struggles to raise her knife.

MEANWHILE --

ROMAN,

--chases Sid into the foyer. She races past the spot where Dewey fell earlier. 
He's gone! Roman jumps at her. Sid disappears into another room.  THE CHASE 
continues.

GALE AND ANGELINA,

Continue the fight. Gale's slamming Angelina's head against the hardwood 
floor. Angelina swipes, slashing Gale along the side, deeply. Gale screams, 
begins to crawl away. She kicks Angelina in the face. Angelina drops the 
knife. Gale stands up, begins to back away.

SIDNEY--

Comes rounding into the foyer again. Roman's right behind her.

SUDDENLY,

WHAM! The laundry room door swings open and the GHOST emerges, KNIFE in hand. 
He buries the knife deep into Roman's chest, sending him flying backwards. 
Sidney screams. The ghost stops in his tracks, pulling off his mask --

IT'S ONLY DEWEY. He can barely stand up. He's bleeding profusely from his 
wounds.

Dewey and Sid embrace.

				SIDNEY
			Dewey my God I thought you were dead.

				DEWEY
			 Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.

SCREAMING O.S.  

				SIDNEY
			DEWEY! IT'S GALE!

Sidney and Dewey race into --

LIVING ROOM --

Gale's got Angelina in a headlock, right beneath the TV UNIT.

				 GALE
			  (screaming)
			THIS IS FOR THE STARDOM I NEVER HAD!
			BITCH!

Gale releases, leaps up, she pushes the TV set down onto Angelina's head. 
Angelina screams, her body trembling from the electric shocks and high 
voltage.

SID and DEWEY stand in the doorway, breathless. Gale approaches them. She and 
Dewey embrace tightly.

ANGELINA's twitching corpse goes limp.

SIDNEY, spots a gun on the mantle. She grabs it, cocks it.

--FOYER --

THE THREE SURVIVORS STEP INTO THE FOYER.  Sid looks down at Roman's corpse.

					DEWEY
			Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always 
			superhuman.

				SIDNEY
			He wasn't superhuman Dewey.
			He wasn't superhuman at all.

THEN A HORRIFYING SCREAM rips through the air.

ANGELINA comes racing out of the living room, face a blackened, Kentucky-fried 
mess. Everyone screams, one epic last scream. Sid raises up the gun, fires, 
hitting Angelina dead center between the eyes, sending a splash of blood and 
brain matter onto the wall behind her.

				GALE
			WHOA! HOLY SHIT IS THIS GONNA MAKE A GOOD BOOK!

Sid turns to Roman's lifeless body.

POV LOOKING UP ON SID TURNING THE GUN DOWN ON US --

				SIDNEY
			  (pissed)
			This shit is really getting repetitive,
			you know?

SID scrunches up her face in anger, pulls the trigger. BLAM! A CLEAN PERFECT 
SHOT TO ROMAN'S HEAD.

Sid drops the gun, walks off set.

   CUT TO:

EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS - THE NEXT MORNING

The police, fire, and ems are all on the scene of the crime.

Dewey's wheeled out of the studio on a stretcher, loaded into an ambulance.

INT.  AMBULANCE 

Gale's right beside him on a stretcher. She leans over, takes his hand.

				DEWEY
			Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what 
			if we try it out again.
			The whole relationship thing.

				GALE
			  (smiles)
			Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.

Dewey smiles. The two kiss feverishly.

 CUT TO:

WALLACE exiting his car. He surveys the damage. Sid passes him.

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			Jesus Christ what happened?
			I leave for two seconds to take my
			kid to the doctor, I come back and it's
			the fucking WILD BUNCH.

				SIDNEY
			It was just something that's been itching 
			to be completed for the past four years.

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			I guess so.

				SIDNEY
			Take care Detective. Give my regards
			to the wife and kids.

Wallace nods his thanks as Sidney walks off through the studio gates, the sun 
rising overhead, as calm and as casually as if nothing's happened. SLOWLY, we 
crane up to an aerial looking down upon HOLLYWOOD. ANOTHER DAY IS BEGINNING. 
AND THIS IS THE PERFECT END FOR A TRILOGY.

CUT TO BLACK

THE END
